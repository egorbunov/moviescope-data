                "text": "\n \"Black Dragons\" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe.\n\n A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him. The reasons behind Colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. Until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend. \n\n Lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. He is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director William Nigh. Lugosi's character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his Dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes.\n\n Clayton Moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become TV's Lone Ranger in a few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine.\n\n Although a little dated now, \"Black Dragons\" is not a bad way to spend an hour. ",

It's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like, \"A true patriot would do this or that.\" It's obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them. I also was surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. There is, of course, the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it. As a curiosity, and a period piece, it may be fun to watch for some people.",

                "text": "This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.\n\nIf you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and turn them into the likenesses of upstanding American businessmen whom the Japanese have kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. He later escapes and travels to America to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly-publicized murders.\n\nIt seemed as though Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the film, and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy. The leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period. \n\nI also found that the camera work was completely uninspired, often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again. After a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for the \"action,\" which is more or less non-existent anyway.\n\nTo me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment, and actors it could become an excellent film. Sadly, these handicaps keep the film back for now, and I can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers.",

                "text": "\nThis piece of tacky WW2 propaganda has Bela Lugosi kill off various fith columnists and leave their corpses outside the Japanese embassy in Washington (with a prominently placed \"Closed\" sign on its door).  Most of the film has Bela darting in and out of various \"hidden\" rooms in his main foe's rather small house and sneaking up on people from behind them. For example, everyone enters the cellar by going round the side of the house and through some front doors above the cellar; Bela, however, appears to get in via some inside door (so he doesn't have to leave the house).  In a scene near the end he drags one of his victims through a previously unseen curtain in the living room and into some huge, medieval-type room with a long table that had previously not featured in the house at all and had somehow been missed by the large contingent of FBI men.  Another scene has him sneak into a small room below the stairs, as hero and heroine ascent the stairs, so he can somehow get into the upstairs room of his Doctor victim before the others. These momentary pleasures, though, are outweighed by the ludicrous climatic flashback plot revelation in which it is revealed that Lugosi is a Nazi plastic surgeon who has transformed Japanese agents into these American-looking fifth columnists.  The daftest moment, in a thoroughly daft film, comes when Lugosi is double-crossed by the fiendish Orientals and thrown into a cell into which, conveniently, is another prisoner who looks exactly like him (but sans beard) and is about to be released.  The Great Man gives a chuckle and takes out his beard-trimming kit (that the Japanese have helpfully left him with).  Welcome to Monogram; a Universe all of its own.

                "text": "None of the critics have much good to say about it, but BLACK DRAGONS is a much better-than-expected attempt at an entirely new genre: flag-waving horror.\n\nBela Lugosi is a mysterious man who mysteriously shows up at a renowned doctor's home, soon after which his guests start mysteriously being murdered. Could it be that they had something to hide? Could there be more to them than meets the eye? What initially fails to make much sense is creatively sorted out in a wonderfully fun B-movie manner.\n\nBLACK DRAGONS was made during the Second World War and it shows, quite painfully at times. The use of the term \"Japs\" will catch some contemporary viewers off guard, but it's really not that bad when you put it into the proper context. The film is clumsily patriotic, and more silly fun than scary or thrilling. Lugosi is an absolute treat, covering up murders and turning on the \"Who, me?\" act with ease.\n\nIt's not a classic, but BLACK DRAGONS is a good, tidy black and white B-film with a certain watch-it-late-at-night appeal. Director William Nigh had a knack for turning poverty row pictures into something special.

I can't say much about the storyline without risking giving away the whole movie. Let's just say that a very mysterious foreigner comes to stay at the house of a doctor in Washington, during the Second World War, and arouses great curiosity among everyone he meets. A group of supposedly respectable businessmen are actually involved in Fifth Column sabotage of the American war effort, and the cryptic Monsieur Colomb is bumping them off, one by one, for reasons of his own. This movie is an absolute gas, with a lot of deliberate humor. Lugosi has many great sinisterly funny lines, and it's truly one of his best roles in Forties B pictures. He seems to be having great fun throughout the movie, and revels in his villainy so much that the viewer can't help but cheer him on. There's even a surprising hint of sexuality that's very rare for an old movie, just lightly suggested, but nonetheless there. The pretty young niece of the doctor is intrigued by Lugosi and flirts with him in one scene, where he seems tempted to have a brief romance with her. The stalwart FBI man played by Clayton Moore ( later television's Lone Ranger) is interested in the girl and a bit jealous of her attraction to Lugosi. This film is just so much fun, every lover of old serials and Forties wartime morale-boosting movies should see it. For Lugosi fans, this is one of his most enjoyable performances. Check it out!",

                "text": "****SPOILERS**** Bela Lugosi takes center stage in this war propaganda movie about a Japanese attempt to sabotage the US war effort by having infiltrated, some years before their attack on Pearl Harbor, by the secret and powerful Japanese cult \"The Order of the Black Dragons\" a number of Japanese impostors posing as top US industrial leaders. \n\nHaving the Black Dragon members \"Americanized\" through plastic surgery by the eminent German surgeon Dr. Meicher, Bela Lugosi. This sinister plan was accomplished by having six US industrialists kidnapped and murdered and then having death masks made of their faces. Dr. Meicher used the death masks to make the six Black Dragons look exactly like the the six dead industrialists. After finishing the job for his Japanese \"friends\" Dr. Meicher was arrested and thrown into a Tokyo dungeon to keep the secret of their plan even from their German allies! Did they-the Black Dragons-also have something like that in store for the Germans? Or was this in some way a ploy by Hollywood back then, in 1942, to split up the Axis? \n\nSharing a cell with a prisoner who was soon to be released who also had a striking resemblance to himself Dr. Meicher takes out of his coat a surgical kit, that for some reason his Japanese captors forgot to confiscate from him, and then does a plastic surgery job on himself! Which was nothing more then shaving off his beard and mustache. Tricking the Japanese into thinking that he was the other prisoner Dr. Meicher makes good his escape or release from prison.\n\nNow some ten years later in the US with a new face and identity Dr. Meicher, or as he now calls himself Monsieur Colomb, is out to get revenge against those Black Dragons members, masquerading as American industrialists, who tried to do him in. Far-fetched but interesting WWII era movie about betrayal and revenge with Monsieur Colomb, again Bela Lugosi, offing all six Black Dragons who had him jailed and tried to have him executed to keep him silent forever.\n\nColomb killed four of the impostors and dumped then on the stairs of the Japanese embassy in Washington DC with Japanese daggers planted in their hands which meaning was, this is only my opinion, that they were back-stabbers. Colomb had another of the Black Dragon impostors killed by luring him from his DC office to the home of Dr. William Saunders, George Pembroke. It was Dr. Saunders who was another one of the Black Dragons that betrayed him. Finally Dr.Saunders, who Colomb used to get the other Black Dragons into his trap, was infected with a serum by Colomb that drove him not only insane but made him look like \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Even though Dr. Meicher-Monsieur Colomb remained loyal to his fatherland throughout the entire movie he did the Allies a great service. By his killing of the Black Dragon members and thus keeping them from destroying America from within he unwittingly made it possible for the fall and defeat of his beloved Fatherland, Germany, in 1945 only proving that revenge, like love, is truly blind. \n\nThe future \"Lone Ranger\" Clayton Moore, as Dick Martin, is also in the movie without his famous mask on playing what seems to be a G-Man. The movie never quite makes clear to the audience just what part of law-enforcement special agent Dick Martin is in: Police, FBI, Secret Service, OSS The Boy Scouts? Moore always introduces himself by flipping open his wallet without saying just who or what he is? \n\nThe part of the Grand Dragon, Standford Jolly, was so unintentionally funny that it spoiled the seriousness, yeah sure, of what the film was trying to tell us. Jolly goes around looking and acting as he was either drunk or on drugs and not looking oriental at all looking instead like a 90 year-old, had he lived that long, Leon Trotsky.",

Joan Barclay, (Alice Saunders), \"Falcon Out West\",'44, investigates all the murders that seem to be happening at the Japanese Embassy and Clayton Moore (Dick Martin), \"The Lone Ranger & The Lost City of Gold\",'58 gave a great supporting role.  By the way, Clayton Moore was considered in his career the best actor to perform the Lone Ranger on Radio and the Movies for years.

ALL of the nine have wild, insane plots and leaps of logic you just have to LIVE with. But that's part of the fun..This one is docked a notch or so for the wooden dialogue between Bela and leading lady Joan Barclay. It sounds like pieces of the I Ching randomly stuck together. This time Bela is killing off a bunch of Japanese spies he fixed up to look JUST LIKE US with plastic surgery. The fun comes when Bela blows their cool and they figure out he's on to them just before he kills each of them. As an added bonus, you actually get to see HORROR makeup used at the end..Yes, it's racist to the hilt. Lugosi gets to call them 'apes', and the word 'Jap' is tossed around WAY too much. Ed Wood fans note: that's Standford Jolly (the judge in THE VIOLENT YEARS) as the head spy in the flash back. Also on hand is Clayton Moore, and he isn't BAD as a fed. A bit more work and he could have been a detective in movies very readily. As it was, he found his once in a lifetime role as the Lone Ranger and stuck with it..but you have to wonder what might have been. But what always fascinates me is Bela's mood and attitude in this one. There is a fatalistic gloom here, a sullen resentment I haven't seen from him anywhere else. At the time he was still bouncing back and forth between Universal and Monogram (BLACK DRAGONS was released between two of their classics..) did the inevitable comparison between the two studios make him think his 9 picture deal was a mistake? His Monogram movie before this one was with the East Side Kids. Lugosi was a classically trained actor who had LITTLE patience for ad libs or fooling around. Did Hall and the gang get to him? In the two movies he did with them he seems to be grinding his teeth, WAITING for someone to end the scene. I dislike reading too much like this into movies, but it's a question I can't get away from.

Basically, the Third Reich dispatch Dr. Melcher (Bela Lugosi of \"Dracula\" with a goatee) to wield his superb skill as a plastic surgeon to turn several Nippons into dead ringer doubles of influential American industrialists. Dr. Melcher does such an admirable job that the Japanese have no choice but to imprison him for fear that he could expose them. The trouble is they incarcerate him with another fellow who looks just like him! Of course, Dr. Melcher manages to escape, but since Katzman produced this epic on a shoe-string budget who don't know how he got from Asian to America. Several cavernous holes appear in the plot. Nevertheless, the idea is clever. Nigh doesn't waste time telling his tale as Melcher shows up late one evening in the comfortable house of Dr. Bill Saunders (George Pembroke) in Washington, D.C., and repays the Japanese from their evil treachery. \n\nDozens of wartime espionage movies came out during the early days of World War II because these thriller was easier for Hollywood studios to produce. Most of the action transpires in America so the movie makers didn't have to dress armies in enemy uniforms. Indeed, this movies dealt with undercover investigations and it was simple Hollywood to tweak a crime thriller and turn it into a contemporary spy chiller. Mind you, \"Black Dragons\" was Lugosi's only excursion into the espionage genre. Nonetheless, he plays a villainous Nazi who exacts his revenge on untrustworthy Japanese. Moreover, since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in a surprise attack, the undercover mission that these industrialists were carrying out to sabotage American industry from within was properly fitting for the time. \n\nOnce Dr. Melcher shows up at Dr. Saunders' house, virtually everybody at the dinner party starts to drop dead, with Kearney as the first. Wallace snoops around Saunder's house and Melchor kills him. Meantime, FBI Chief Colton (Kenneth Harlan) has assigned a handsome field agent, Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore of future \"Lone Ranger\" fame) to conduct the investigation. Not long after Kearney shows up dead at the entrance of the closed Japanese Embassy. Saunder's daughter, Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay of \"The Corpse Vanishes\"), shows up, but she finds her father a sick recluse behind the locked door of his bedroom. Dr. Melcher claims to be his physician. One by one, Melcher kills the Japanese impersonating wealthy American industrialists. Eventually, with less than ten minutes remaining, one of the Japanese explains with the help of a flashback how Melcher came to do what he did. The performances are good and the Axis enemy is depicted as vile. They turn on each other without a qualm. Along with the revelation about the plastic surgery, \"Black Dragons\" boasts another surprise. The action takes place primarily in rooms and there are no gunfights or car chases.",

                "text": "\"Japs Bomb Honolulu During Peace Talks\" is the headline that opens this World War II era mystery thriller, featuring Bela Lugosi as a Nazi plastic surgeon who turns six Japanese members of the Black Dragon Society into replicas of American fifth column industrialists. When Dr. Melcher is rewarded for his efforts by imprisonment to contain the deadly secret, he uses his surgical kit (which somehow escaped detection) to magically remove his beard and transform himself into a fellow prisoner who looks exactly like Bela Lugosi. So how were two identical looking prisoners explained away by their Japanese captors? This plot point obviously didn't bother the film makers, so I won't let it bother me beyond mentioning it.\n\nOtherwise, \"Black Dragons\" is a fairly entertaining diversion replete with murder and mayhem, as Melcher, now Dr. Colomb arrives in the U.S. to systematically remove each of his creations. They wind up as corpses on the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washinton, D.C., each with dagger in hand, as if in ritual suicide, but obviously as murder victims.\n\nAlong for the fun are Joan Barclay as Alice Saunders, niece of host industrialist William Saunders (George Pembroke), and future Lone Ranger star Clayton Moore as a government agent. You'll recognize his voice before his face, and you might not at that if you don't realize he's in this film.\n\nFor his part, Bela Lugosi uses the Dracula stare several times in the film to send a departure message to his victims. Gone is the over enunciation of his early film days when he was just beginning to learn English, though the rhythmic quality of his voice is still there.\n\nMaybe I'm reading a bit too much into the the film's final scene, but when Dr. Saunders finally comes out of the room where he was kept immobile by Dr. Colomb, he emerges completely wrapped in a dark blanket or cloak. Unveiling himself as a disfigured old man, I couldn't help thinking - \"Darth Vader'!",

One of the many cheapies made by poverty-row studio Monogram during the decade, this sees the former Dracula actor playing a Nazi plastic surgeon (!), come to gain revenge on the men who betrayed him. Although BLACK DRAGONS is only an hour in length, viewers will feel every second of this plodding thriller. The budget is non-existent, with the majority of the scenes taking place in someone's house; the dialogue is often absurd, and the actors interchangeable. For a thriller, it works up exactly no thrills or scares, and the only bit I genuinely liked was the climax, which reveals a fine (if a bit silly) twist in flashback.\n\nIt's hard to lay blame at the door of director William Nigh, who directed dozens of films during this period, including some detective potboilers with Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong. He makes the best of what he can. It's also hard to fault Lugosi, who, despite suffering from addiction and pain at this stage of his career, is still the best thing in the film; you've gotta love his sinister persona and the dialogue he spouts on occasion. There's also a bit where he strangles somebody which is very well staged. But the rest of the cast is humdrum, enlivened only by a brief cameo from Keye Luke (one of Hollywood's most popular Chinese actors) and the appearance of Clayton Moore, better known as THE LONE RANGER, here seeming very wooden as the FBI agent. BLACK DRAGONS is a boring spy flick with only a couple of decent scenes, and it's best to pass this one up in favour of some of Lugosi's better movies.",

Black Dragons is one of the daftest films I've ever watched. Six businessmen have a meeting to discuss how they are going to make money off then expanding World War 2. The Japanese have just attacked Pearl Harbour and these guys want to cash in on that. The sound was a bit dodgy but I caught the gist of it. Then, towards the end of one of their parties, Bela turns up at the front door and before you know it the host is acting a bit strange, Bela's been invited to stay, and one of the guests has been murdered (somehow, Bela manages to sneak into a cab and get the guy out without the driver noticing, and that's just the start of the head scratching antics here!) The host has now locked himself in his room and seems to talk in a stilted, weird manner. This is because Bela is using him like a ventriloquists dummy, in a way that wasn't explained (more head scratching). The other businessmen get suspicious, and start snooping around and turning on each other. Meanwhile, the host guy's niece turns up at the home to stay but doesn't have any luck getting the guy out of the room, the cops are snooping around, and Bela's sauntering about like he owns the place, dropping hints and charming everyone around him. More businessmen turn up dead, outside the Japanese embassy, and the cops are running out of leads (hey morons, what about the stranger in that guy's house that's going on about how dangerous he is?), but why is Bela doing all this? You'd know if you read the blurb at the top of the page anyway. *Spoilers here* Well, turns out Bela was a Nazi party member and renowned surgeon hired by the Japanese to perform surgery on six Japanese guys in order to make them resemble prominent businessmen who'd had gone missing some years earlier (it's okay, the Japanese had death masks made). Somehow, he manages to perform this surgical feat and the businessman have all travelled back to the US to take their places (complete with American accents). Height? Don't ask me how they did that, but they double crossed Bela and threw him into a jail with a guy who looks exactly like him, and\u0085AND\u0085left Bela with his surgical instruments so he can perform surgery on the guy who looks exactly like him, so he can look even more like him! What? Stop asking me questions! I don't know why! With this utterly brain damaged premise, the unexplained hypnotism, and the mutating of one of the guys, somehow, you've got a Lugosi film that's even more ridiculous than the other films from this era (although the Ape Man gives it a good running).",

Perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as THE RAVEN) to big-budget flicks (like NINOTCHKA) to grade-Z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. Interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced WWII propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. But at the end, we find out that he is himself a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese!!!! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to American-like men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all VERY Western looking--many with bald heads!! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. Or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. In fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old Model T Fords--obviously from stock footage!!! The bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.",

This, in and of itself, is interesting enough, as it affords modern audiences a glimpse into the collective mindset of Americans during the post-Pearl Harbor era. There are certainly parallels that can be drawn between some of the psychological implications embedded in Black Dragons with what contemporary U.S. citizens are struggling with in a society still recovering from the unexpected brutality of 9/11, but that's where anything remotely interesting contained in the film stops.\n\nWhat you really get with this Bela Lugosi vehicle is a dry, sleep- inducing murder mystery that's almost exclusively set in a large house. The story is as muddled as they come. It centers on people who are found dead with Japanese daggers clutched in one hand, and this (it seems) is the stimulus for some sort of massive Eastern conspiracy centered around mind control.\n\nOr something like that.\n\nIt's incredibly difficult to make sense of anything that happens, and this isn't just the product of boring writing. The sound of the film ranges from acceptably clear to indeterminably static-filled. At points it sounds like someone is moon-walking across a twenty yard sheet of cellophane. With a film this old, I wouldn't usually linger on something as expected as lackluster sound, but here it really does detract from the overall understanding/appreciation of what's taking place. And that's a bad thing.\n\nMaking it to the end of Black Dragons is akin to struggling through a school-assigned documentary: you're watching it because you don't have a choice. In that regard, the most terrifying thing about the film is how much effort it takes to stay awake for the duration of its 64-minute run-time.",

The real Black Dragons were members of the Amur River Society (Kokuryu-kai) in 1930s and 1940s Japan.\n\nThis far-fetched portrayal of the Black Dragons features Bela Lugosi as Nazi plastic surgeon Dr. Melcher who alters the appearance of Japanese secret agents to look like American businessmen. But, the chief of the Black Dragons doublecrosses Dr. Melcher and imprisons him in Japan. Melcher escapes and reappears in the United States as Monsieur Colomb, bent on revenge, systematically murdering his former patients, leaving their bodies on the steps of Japan's Washington, DC Embassy, each time with a telltale dagger nearby.\n\nThis 1942 Black Dragons has a sequence in which an Eastern Airlines DC-3 marked with \"The Great Silver Fleet\" flies past the New York City skyline. A\nfew minutes later the same airplane flies in the other direction past the New York City skyline with the words and letters reversed. No doubt this resulted from measures to save time and money in the filming, I don't think it was a mistake. How was this done?

            "Prior to the beginning of World War II, the Nazis, at the request of Japan's Black Dragon Society, sends Doctor Melcher to Japan to transform six Japanese into identical likenesses of six prominent Americans. The Americans are done away with and Melcher, on the orders of High Dragon Yakhamea, is imprisoned so his secret will die with him. In his cell, Melcher switches places with the soon-to-be-released Colomb and, when he is freed, follows the six Japanese to America, where they have assumed the positions of the industrialists and are causing sabotage in the Monogram defense plants that didn't exist yet as the war hadn't started. One by one Melcher kills the impostors, despite the fact they are performing for-free work for his employer Adolph, and dumps their bodies on the steps of the Japanese Embassy, which still existed as the war hadn't started. FBI Chief Colton and agent Dick Martin finally piece together what the five murdered men had in common---aha, a visit to Japan---and stake out the sixth man as bait for Melcher."

But it is not one of the more known works by the very prolific company, maybe because it features none of their trademark characters. No Bug, no Daffy, no Porky. Instead we have two dogs who run into a lot of trouble with a restless robot. I must say there are moments when this film is cute and moments when it is entertaining, but it is not enough I must say and this film is also one of the rare occasions when Warner Bros went over the top with the sound and music. I am not only talking about the band we hear on one occasion, even if that was pretty creepy, not because of the singing, which was fine, but because of the animation that went with it. Overall, this one does not really deserve to be more popular than it is. I don't recommend the watch.",

They were fiercely patriotic women who dared to dream of flying. \n\nI am helping one of these wonderful women prepare stories from this period (she is in her 90's). I am so proud to know her and have a chance to help compile this tiny bit of history. This movie was made and used as a propaganda movie by the \"good old boys\" as a way to get rid of women pilots. It made them appear like tramps. This is far from the truth. It did, unfortunately, work. The WASPS were deactivated as Congressmen were told to watch the movie, as if it were a documentary on the behavior of the girls. These women braved the unimaginable at this time in our history. They are heroes to every young woman who has a dream. This movie slanders their memory and service. It trivializes their bravery and service. \n\nSome of these ladies died. \n\nOne of the jobs was to serve as a \"tow target.\" That meant they flew with a big bullseye behind the plane so BOYS could get target practice. Too honorable and dedicated to reject such a foolish job, they did it. They were helping! Young girls of today have no comprehension how hard their grandmothers fought to give them the opportunities they have today. Someday, soon, I hope, they will remake an accurate form of this movie -- while some of these treasures are still alive. (Very few WASPS are still alive.) I was incredibly sad to see the summary of this movie, saying how it helped the \"war morale.\" War is hell, but to use a movie as a vehicle to trash this group of brave women makes me sick. Would somebody please re-make this movie? Tell the REAL story of dedication, hard thankless service and sometimes death. \n\nMy old friend actually started to cry when she told me Hollywood made a movie alleging they were all tramps. It always seems strange to hear an old woman to use those words. Yet, she was once a young woman -- she was one of the first women pilots in the world -- 21 years old with the wind blowing through her hair - literally. This was not done to get a man. They had to be perfect and \"the best,\" because they had to prove themselves. I also could not believe that Congresmen watched this movie as \"evidence\" of how the women pilots behaved. It could not be farther from the truth. Remake time! Please!",

Since there are no other comments, I thought I would add it here, sort of a public service, or something! My rating may be a bit generous.\n\nThe New Pictures Monday, Apr. 03, 1944 Four Jills in a Jeep (20th Century-Fox) and Ladies Courageous (Universal) are Hollywood's idea of what women can do for the war and painful examples of what Hollywood, under the pressure of patriotism, can do to women. In the first, Hollywood vigorously shakes its own hand for letting some actresses go to shake a leg on the world battlefronts. In the second, Loretta Young, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Diana Barrymore pilot planes around the U.S. The Jeep bounces Carole Landis, Kay Francis, Martha Raye and Mitzi Mayfair through a catch-as-catch-can cineversion of Miss Landis' book (and Satevepost articles) of the same title, reporting their experiences as USO entertainers. In the book, only Miss Landis got married. In the picture, Martha Raye, the feminists' Joe E. Brown, practically ingests the comic sergeant (Phil Silvers) who chauffeurs their jeep. Mitzi Mayfair snuggles up to a uniformed ex-vaudeville partner (Dick Haymes, who is Fox's threat to Frank Sinatra, and sings like melting vanilla ice cream). Kay Francis plays handles with an English Army doctor who utters the stunning gallantry : \"If I'd held this hand ten years ago I might have a full house now.\" Miss Francis just laughs. In Britain and Africa, the cinemactresses clearly enjoyed themselves, worked hard, and brought some pleasure to places where it was needed. But not much of the reworking of their travelogue is fun to see or hear. Ladies Courageous comes in on a shattered wing and an unanswered prayer, noses over, and spills out a motley set of WAFS (see cut, p. 94) who later become WASPS. This whole covey of highly burnished cinemactresses looks more like Wam-pas cuties than like aeronauts. Judging by their actions, they cannot be trusted to pilot a perambulator, much less a B17. Miss Barrymore philanders with another WAF's husband; his wife remorsefully crashes her plane. Miss Fitzgerald, a neurotic, embarrasses her sister, Director Young, by making a hot landing (for publicity purposes). But she compensates for that by all but killing herself and another WAF in two other planes. Loretta Young comforts her warmly: \"You tried!\" \n\nOne wag emerged from the preview with a theme song for the girls: The men will forgive us (The ones that outlive us) No matter how often we fail. Who cares what trees-in The plane falls that she's-in. She's got a sting in her tail.",

While the film is SUPPOSED to celebrate these women and SHOULD have been an advancement for the cause of equal rights, in many, many ways it seems to have the covert message \"women really AREN'T as qualified as men\". Why? Because too often these supposedly professional women act as if their every action is governed by feelings or raging hormones. Now don't get me wrong...I do NOT agree with this at all...but the film seems to constantly reinforce this idea because these supposedly smart women often act awfully dumb...and it's up to their Colonel (Loretta Young) to continually pick up the pieces and try to make the best of the many disasters caused by some of the women--particularly the Colonel's nutty sister.

Unfortunately, only four entries were made in each series, and each and every one are to be cherished.\n\n\"Nancy Drew--Detective,\" the first of its quartet, is an unalloyed delight. A wealthy elderly woman donates her fortune to Nancy's highschool (to build a swimming pool) and then promptly disappears.  Nancy, spurred to action by the beating of the woman's physician, enlists the reluctant aid of her athletic boyfriend (the extremely appealing and good-humored Frankie Thomas) to find out what happened to the missing lady.  Clues are provided by a carrier pigeon, a breathtaking airplane expedition, an ominous gunman who breaks into the Drews' residence threatening them to keep quiet--or else!\n\nUndeterred, Nancy drags Ted on a hair-raising adventure where they eventually track down the missing benefactor to a bogus nursing home on Larkspur Lane (password to anyone trying to enter the front gate is \"blueberries\"). What makes the film (and its successors) such delectable diversions is, besides the intricate plots, fast-paced direction, and splendid production design and cinematography, is the definitive performances by Ms. Granville, Thomas, John Litel (as Nancy's attorney father), Rene Riano (as the Drews' hyperventilating housekeeper), and a host of first-rate supporting actors.\n\nThe Nancy Drew films are as beguiling today as they were over 60 years ago (and, incidentally, depict family life in that era with a sassy sweetness that is truly enchanting).\n\nDon't miss \"Nancy Drew--Detective\" or any of its three sequels, which TCM has been showing with regularity.  These four treasures of yesteryear sparkle with wit, suspense, expert plotting and performances today's movies couldn't recapture if they tried to.  The talent so abundant in the studio films of years gone by no longer exists. ",

Nancy still has her roadster.\n\nThe Nancy Drew mysteries are wonderful reads, and this film was fun to watch, even with the little changes. Bonita Granville, who, as Bonita Granville Wrather became the producer of the \"Lassie\" TV series, certainly looks like Nancy (who in the books was always having \"luncheon\"). I had always envisioned while reading the books a more sophisticated, less madcap Nancy, but Granville's energetic (almost hyper) characterization fits a film portrayal well. Ned is a little bit of a goof, but a smart one. John Litel was right casting as Carson Drew, Nancy's father, a widower who didn't date.\n\nThe plot can be figured out in the first ten seconds, but these movies were for the teen-aged audience who knew the books.

Therefore it's always amused me that the first book chosen to (liberally) adapt for the big screen, The Password To Larkspur Lane from 1933 was one written by a man, Walter Karig. There weren't as many astounding plot co-incidences in his 3 books as with Wirt's and it shows in the screenplay here.\n\nNancy ably played by Bonita Granville is intuitively sure a nice rich old lady has been kidnapped for her money, her Dad's not too sure, but her beau Ted grumblingly followed her lead. This involves letting a message-bearing homing pigeon free and improbably following it by car to the nest of gangsters improbably led by otherwise sophisticated James Stephenson. It doesn't matter but it grates a little bit with Ned the confident proto-man changed to Ted the juvenile radio ham, Nancy is played slightly more immature than the stories at the time leading to the cops continually calling her a little girl, Effie was supposed to be 17 not middle aged, and Carson Drew although well played by John Litel never lost his temper like he did in here! But overall it's an engrossing pleasant mystery - good photography got the atmosphere of River Heights just right too.\n\nNot recommended for the serious! Obviously they couldn't be as good as the books but they were all good efforts and solid family entertainment and imho miles better than the 1970's TV series.

                "text": "While not quite capturing the essence and old-fashioned charm of the original Nancy Drew novels, Warner Bros. turned out a series of pleasant programmers starring BONITA GRANVILLE as the teen-age sleuth who is a lot smarter at solving crimes than her elders.\n\nThe Nancy Drew of the original stories came across as a bit more sophisticated in her behavior than she is in any of the Nancy Drew films. And sometimes Granville's girlish behavior borders on brat territory and can be slightly annoying--but overall she's a bundle of teen-age energy in the role and FRANKIE THOMAS as Ted makes an appealing helpmate out of a rather colorless role.\n\nJOHN LITEL, a reliable Warner contract player, is perfectly cast as Nancy's attorney father. The story involves the disappearance of a nice old lady who has contributed a good sum of money to Nancy's school and then promptly disappears from sight. Nancy takes a chance on tracking her down (in some highly improbable ways) and she and her boyfriend are able to solve the case in time for the predictable happy ending.\n\nBased on \"The Password to Larkspur Lane\", it passes the time pleasantly enough in a modest running time, although it's not without its faults and is clearly aimed at younger viewers familiar with the Drew stories.\n\nSumming up: A fairly good start to the series.",

But when she disappears before the gift can be finalized, Nancy immediately suspects foul play. And when Nancy witnesses the local doctor being kidnapped, she's sure she's on the right track. Can Nancy, with the help of her friend Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas), find and rescue the old woman? \n\nHonestly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy Nancy Drew \u0096 Detective quite as much as I did. Sure, I'm a fan of 1930s-style mysteries like the Charlie Chan or Falcon series, but from afar, I've always thought of the Nancy Drew movies too lightweight and fluffy in comparison (though when I think about it, there's nothing deep and meaningful about Chan or any of the other movies I've enjoyed for years). And though Nancy Drew \u0096 Detective is a breezy affair, it's still very enjoyable. I cannot come up with enough positives to write about Bonita Granville. She has an infectious charm that dominates the entire movie. It's hard to watch her and not have a smile on your face. You just naturally root for her. The supporting players, particularly John Litel as Carson Drew and Frankie Thomas as Ted Nickerson, also add a lot of enjoyment to the movie.\n\nThe mystery elements of Nancy Drew \u0096 Detective hardly matter. It's quite obvious from the start what has happened to the old woman Nancy is looking for. But none of that really matters. The important thing is watching Nancy and the gang get to the final solution. It's just a lot of fun!",

                "text": "Nancy Drew, Detective, turns very serious drama campy, which is actually one of the best ways to handle serious drama. The real novels in the series depict Nancy as sophisticated, intelligent, multi-talented, (read: Mary Richards of MTM) and, up until about 1965, dressed like a model in heels, suits, tailored dresses and hats while she completes the majority of the legwork for her sleuthing.\n\nThe film depicts a less-than-perfect, giddy, and at times, juvenile Nancy. Based on \"The Password to Larkspur Lane,\" Nancy's sidekicks Bess, George (a girl), and Helen, are written out of the movies, in favor of boyfriend Ned (re-named Ted in the films). This obviously promotes a Garland/Rooney type relationship.\n\nThe plot unevenly blends in comic relief from the original story, now at an outlandish angle, and makes intelligent sophisticate Nancy into a typical teen. The change in characterization killed all hopes for this series to run for more than the brief four films involved. Fans of Nancy, and, the publishing icon Harriet S. Adams, were both disappointed with Warner Brothers' treatment of the famous teen. So much so, that when Harriet regained the film rights, the famous sleuth wasn't filmed again until 1977.",

                "text": "Rather than writing a long review on all four movies, I will be remarking on the whole series and the individual movies here.\n\nBonita Granville stars as sleuth Nancy Drew, based on books by Carolyn Keane, though I hear they're not completely faithful as they take out some of her girlfriends, which was probably a good thing, as they want to emphasize on Miss Granville's character and her on-going relationship with supposed boyfriend and partner in sleuthing, Ted Nickerson, played by Frankie Thomas, but against his better judgment. Dad is lawyer Carson Drew, played John Litel, and the law is represented by Frank Orth, a rather inept police chief who takes the easy decisions with less work to it. He is seen in the first installment and the last, Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase.\n\nI won't be going into the actual plots of each, but I will say that if you want a fun fast-paced mystery, then you should see this mystery series which is out on DVD. Of the four movies, I would rank the third, Nancy Drew - Troubleshooter, as the best with a rating of '9', with some great aerial shots of Nancy and Ted in a plane they can't fly (they were put in that position by the bad guys) and with a subplot of a love interest for her dad. This installment moves very briskly and is very funny. The last one, Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase, I would rank as '8' and the first one, maybe '8', too. (My favorite two are the last two, but they are all entertaining.) But the weakest in my opinion is the second one, Nancy Drew - Reporter, ranked '6' or '7' tops, due mainly to the presence of two young actors who are too obnoxious to bear, Ted's younger sister and friend. \n\nIn almost all of these movies, the killer is already known by the viewer as there are very few suspects. The fun and entertainment is in the case, the chase, and the predicaments that Nancy Drew gets in with Ted. On the whole, the Nancy Drew series does provide Bonita Granville a chance to stand out and shine from her other films and from other stars of her age. And, you get to see Hollywood making some family entertainment that should be enjoyed by all. My rating of '8' at the top is for the whole series. I just wish they could have made more, but maybe Miss Granville or the bigwigs got tired of them. It all ends with a remark that \"Ted\" is in trouble again, \"dad.\" Ironic, of course, it's because of Nancy Drew, that he got in trouble. Nancy Drew may help her friends and solve murders, but it also has its consequences for others along the way.",

Thomas says \"Let's keep it clean\" and makes the \"drag\" scene. \"Nancy Drew - Detective\" shows how well a \"small\" genre film can be done.

But despite the presence in Hollywood over sixty subsequent years of Ford, Wyler, Kubrick, Coppola, Scorsese et al, The Hunchback of Notre Dame remains as fresh, as emotionally resonant and yes as powerfully artistic as the day it was made. What constitutes 'art' is of course a personal matter, just as the Breughel-like compositions of Hunchback might be as mystifying to someone whose favourite film is A Clockwork Orange (Lichtenstein?). But what makes Hunchback so satisfying as art is precisely that its makers didn't set out with art in mind. Dieterle and his co-creators embarked on the project with the aim of telling a great yarn, making it look authentic, and above all ENTERTAINING the audience. It is to this end that the Grand Guignol excesses of the novel were trimmed or altered, and the Hollywood bittersweet ending imposed. Audiences filed out with their Kleenex in hand having witnessed a three-ring circus of a movie, then went home to read the war-soaked newspapers.\n\n  Virtually every frame of this movie could be taken in isolation, made into a poster and hung on a wall. Examples include Gringoire cradling the dying Clopin as a rivulet of lead trickles past in the background, the voyeuristic eye of Quasimodo peering through fence palings at the dancing Esmeralda - I could go on and on. And pervading it all is the magnificent score of Alfred Newman, surely his finest ever.\n\n  Rather than sing its obvious praises, the film can simply speak for itself. As narrative, as character, as cinema craft, it is totally successful throughout. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favourite film of all time, bar none. Ten out of ten",

Maureen O'Hara is stunning (in her first American film) as Esmeralda, the gypsy girl. She is lovely to look at in each one of her scene's and shows a special sort of kindness and sympathy toward the hunchback that other actresses who have played the role have failed to convey in the role (albeit, Patsy Ruth Miller was very good in the Lon Chaney silent version). There are many touching scenes in this film; Esmeralda bringing Quasimodo water while he's on the pillory, the rousing saving of Esmeralda from the gallows and the bittersweet finale (which makes one melt like butter) are all cinematic gems. Also, there is the splendor of many memorable mob scenes and a beautiful reconstruction of medieval beggar ridden Paris. See this version.

                "text": "Though the French have done many versions of Victor Hugo's celebrated classic, this version starring Charles Laughton has certainly stood the test of time and is the best known and loved in the English speaking world.\n\nLon Chaney, Sr. did an acclaimed silent version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Laughton was following a great tradition. And he did it in the manner of Chaney, almost without dialog. Not that Hugo wrote too much dialog for Quasimodo in his story, but except for his time with Esmerelda in the tower after he rescues her, Laughton is almost speechless in the film. Of course his character in addition to being deformed is also deaf from the ringing of those cathedral bells.\n\nQuasimodo born deformed as he was, was left as an orphan on the steps of the Notre Dame cathedral in medieval Paris. Raised in the sheltered atmosphere of the church, he derives some joy in his duties as the bell ringer in the tower. His mentor is the brother of the archbishop played by Cedric Hardwicke and the archbishop is Walter Hampden. Quasimodo's life is useful, but without love. \n\nBut Laughton is crushing out on Esmerelda the gypsy girl played by Maureen O'Hara in her American screen debut. Problem is that Hardwicke is also getting hot and bothered by her.\n\nHardwicke's role is the second best acted in the film next to Laughton's. He's a man with shall we say some issues. He's purportedly committed to the church and it's celibacy requirements. But Dr. Freud wasn't around back in the day of Louis XI to tell us about sex drives. Hardwicke's desires mean only one thing, Esmerelda has to have bewitched him. When he kills Alan Marshal who is also interested in Maureen and looks like he's about to round third so to speak, the blame goes on Maureen.\n\nWhat I like about the story is how the lives of two very ordinary people, Quasimodo and Esmerelda, become the focal point for a whole lot of religious and political issues of the day. The church, the peasants, the just developing middle class, and the nobility all have an agenda as far as the Esmerelda murder case is going. The only agenda poor Quasimodo has is he's in love with her.\n\nMaureen O'Hara who was a discovery of Charles Laughton back in the United Kingdom was pushed by Laughton for the role of Esmerelda and traveled with him to America to play the part. She was grateful to him ever afterwards for any career she had and can't praise him enough for getting RKO to sign her.\n\nHarry Davenport probably plays the most benign Louis XI ever put on film. It sure is a far cry from Basil Rathbone in If I Were King or Robert Morley in Quentin Durward. He plays him like the kindly grandfather he usually plays on screen.\n\nThomas Mitchell as Clopin the king of beggars and Edmond O'Brien as Gringoire the poet are two other significant roles. O'Brien gets his first substantial role on screen in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and this was a banner year for Thomas Mitchell. In 1939 he was also in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Gone With the Wind and Stagecoach for which he won Best Supporting Actor. He could have though for any one of these films.\n\nWhen all is said and done though the film belongs to Charles Laughton who was the screen's best portrayer of tortured humanity. Even beneath all of Bud Westmore's grotesque make-up we can feel his anguish. He's not a stupid man Quasimodo, he knows how repulsive he is to most of the human race. He's childlike though, something like Peter Sellers in Being There, another character raised in a secluded atmosphere.\n\nTo see Charles Laughton at the top of his game in my humble opinion one has to see The Hunchback of Notre Dame.",

Most of the versions of the story have been at least watchable, because the Victor Hugo novel provides so much good material to work with, much of it well-suited for cinema. This adaptation, though, is one of the best at making good use of what it offers.\n\nIt's interesting to compare this picture with the 1923 Lon Chaney version - not for the sake of ranking them, since both are fully worthy of attention in their own right, but because they offer somewhat different strengths, and because they emphasize somewhat different aspects of the story.\n\nChaney and Laughton are both quite effective as Quasimodo, each giving an interpretation of the character that corresponds to the actor's skills. Laughton brings out Quasimodo's feelings and perspective quite well. In this version, for example, the flogging scene is longer and more detailed, and it is one of Laughton's most effective scenes. Chaney is particularly good at reacting to the other characters and their actions. Both give the character a distinctive and memorable look.\n\nO'Hara is also one of this adaptation's strengths. Patsy Ruth Miller was good in the Chaney version, but O'Hara has the advantage of spoken dialogue, and she makes the character of Esmerelda her own.\n\nWhile the Chaney version especially emphasized the atmosphere, this one has quite a bit of action. The tumultuous climactic sequences are done quite well, and they leave a vivid impression. Overall, this is a very satisfying adaptation of the fine classic novel.\n",

The look and the atmosphere of it have lodged ineradicably in a corner of my mind ever since, and the rescue of Esmeralda from the gibbet was and probably still is my favorite scene in a Hollywood movie. I never got to see the movie theatrically until a few years ago, when Disney hosted a showing as an excuse to preview clips of its animated version (which is based on this movie more than on the novel). The movie probably played as strongly then as it had fifty years earlier, and I have no doubt it will play the same in another fifty years. Seeing it with an audience made me realize for the first time that it is Sir Cedric Hardwicke's movie, rather than Laughton's. He dominates the story, and commands the screen whenever he appears. Since the Hays Office prohibited showing a lubricious priest, the writers did something clever: they changed the character into Javert from Hugo's \"Les Miserables,\" here promoted to chief prosecutor, and a hypocritically high-minded celibate: as Esmeralda puts it, he seems like a priest without being one. Hardwicke's performance is superbly subtle, and his character must be one of the most intimately despicable movie villains of all time. Laughton is terrific. too; his cadences on lines like \"She gave me a drink of water\" are classic. (When Mandy Patinkin played the part, he himself admitted that he was simply replaying Laughton's score and hoping he'd be able to hit all the notes.) As for Maureen O'Hara, if I came across a gypsy dancer like her I'd be moved to swing into the square and rescue her myself. And how can anyone not like Thomas Mitchell's beggar king? The only substantial fault in the playing, I think, is Harry Davenport's characterization of Louis XI, which is funny but more broadly written and played than what surrounds it. \n\nStrangely, although this is more a horror film than the other versions of the novel and contains many frightening scenes, I never thought of it as belonging to that genre and I still don't. It's much more than that. I knew someone who called it Hollywood's finest hour; he can't have been far wrong.",

SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and GOODBYE MR. CHIPS it was the best year for the old sound film system of the big studios. Among the great films was this one - the second of two classic versions of the Victor Hugo novel (the 1923 silent version with Lon Chaney being the first). \n\nLet us acknowledge that this version is the most fun and the one people turn to. It is reminiscent of the best known and liked version of LES MISERABLES (also a novel by Hugo) made by Paramount in 1935 and starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton. That Laughton should appear in both shows his remarkable versatility as Hollywood's greatest character actor of his period. Inspector Javert is as unsympathetic a figure as Quasimodo is a sympathetic one. It is true that the makeup on the unfortunate hunchback makes him initially a figure to pity, but his heroism rises in the movie (as it does in the novel) so that the reader never deserts him. The reader never feels that way about Inspector Javert.\n\nThis and JAMAICA INN were both made in 1939, and both paired Laughton and Maureen O'Hara. Here O'Hara's Esmaralda is both lovely and powerless, a gypsy hated for her background in superstitious and medieval France. Yet she is lusted after by so many. Forgetting the hunchback there are Phoebus, Gringoire, and (not least) Claude Frollo. Alan Marshall plays Captain Phoebus as the straw-man hero he is - he is strong and manly on the surface, but he is easily dismissed (particularly by the conniving villain). Edmond O'Brien is partly a comic figure - Hugo's way of poking fun at himself, perhaps, as he was a poet like Gringoire. But I doubt if Hugo ever yelled in disappointment for failing to be crowned \"King of the Fools\" for a festival. \n\nThen there is Cedric Hardwicke's Frollo. Leslie Halliwell, in HALLIWELL'S HUNDRED, reviews the film and says it is Hardwicke's best performance. Perhaps (I'd opt for his father in the 1949 THE WINSLOW BOY first). He is a Machiavellian before the Italian political philosopher came upon the scene, busy pulling invisible wires from the church to control the country, the church, and the monarchy. But he is unaware of his Achilles' heel. A member of a celibate profession, he finds himself falling for a woman - and one from a despised and suspect group. Fighting his inclinations, but at the same time giving into them, he is the motivator of all the evil in the plot - not only against Esmeralda, but Quasimodo, and the citizens of Paris. His fate is as unlamented by the viewers as that of Javert was in LES MISERABLES.\n\nHarry Davenport and Walter Hampden play King Louis XI of France and the archbishop of Paris (Frollo's brother). It was an early film role for the elderly Hampden, and he gives a good account for himself, but there really enough for himself until the conclusion, when coming to his senses he berates his brother (had Frollo not met his fate, he would have lost his power). Davenport is interesting. Usually playing kindly, lovable grandpas (MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is a fine example), he does not leave that image here. But as has been mentioned in another review of this film, Louis XI was an excellent King of France - clever and careful. But he was \"the Spider King\". Basil Rathbone's performance in IF I WERE KING two years earlier was closer to the mark. To be a \"Spider King\" one has to be devilishly ruthless, trapping enemies in webs. Davenport's kindly old codger King is not that way at all. I would also add that the performance of Thomas Mitchell as the King of Paris' beggars is equally good - a wise opportunist, who is unable to achieve what he wishes (the looting of the rich by his mob, signaled by their assault on the cathedral).\n\nBy now one can see that I like this film - it is a rousing entertainment, and emotionally quite fulfilling. But was it the novel? I will leave that for another review.",

Surprising is Edmund O'Brien's excellent portrayal of the people's poet, Gringoire. But of course the star of the movie is Charles Laughton, whose portrayal of the poor and hapless Quasimodo, who is hopelessly in love with the beautiful Esmeralda, transforms this movie from an interesting period piece into a really powerful story. For this movie is truly dramatic - in its portrayal of the power of the Church in medieval society; its portrayal of the people themselves, who are angry, restless, and desperate; and its portrayal of an unfortunate man, Quasimodo, an outcast, who transcends his place in society to defend the woman he loves, without conditions, and protect the Church and in the process becomes a hero. By the way, Maureen O'Hara's portrayal of the gypsy girl Esmeralda is so strong and evocative that one cannot help but empathize with the character who is the very personification of victimization.

                "text": "The general public responds to the grotesque with a curious mixture of shock, fascination and repulsion. In the 15th century, where society was too ignorant to understand the consequences of deformity, men like Quasimodo were shunned from the community, and considered evil influences \u0096 as we approach modern times, it seems that people have changed little, as depicted in David Lynch's heartbreaking 'The Elephant Man (1980).' Despite the proud, if misguided, belief that humans judge each other based on their intelligence and personality, our basic primal instinct often proves dominant. Just as many recoil in horror at the misshapen features of the unfortunate Quasimodo, an entire audience is left entranced by the beautiful dancing body of Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara), momentarily forgetting that she is of the reviled gypsy faith. Victor Hugo's 1831 novel, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" has long been a popular source for cinematic adaptations, and William Dieterle's 1939 version is often considered one of the best, featuring an incredibly heartfelt performance from Charles Laughton as the titular hunchback of Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nWhen he initially published his novel, Hugo titled the story \"Notre-Dame de Paris.\" He was subsequently dissatisfied with the English translation of the title, since it implied that the Quasimodo was the story's main character, when, in fact, he had originally intended it to be a celebration of the cathedral itself, an attempt to \"preserve\" the famed monument. This objective is certainly an admirable one, but, as far as Dieterle's film is concerned, it results in a somewhat uneven narrative. Gringoire (Edmond O'Brien) and Esmerelda certainly serve the story adequately enough, but our thoughts and sympathies are forever with the tragic Quasimodo, and any scene that doesn't feature him seems insignificant \u0096 perhaps further proof of our natural fascination towards the grotesque. Also playing major roles in the story are Frollo (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), Quasimodo's sinister mentor who falls in love and is tormented by rejection, and King Louis XI (Harry Davenport), the open-minded but rather naive French royal {a far cry from what history tells us of the real Louis XI}.\n\nThough screenwriters Sonya Levien and Bruno Frank fashioned Victor Hugo's conclusion into what has been called a \"happy ending,\" it nonetheless remains the most heartbreakingly tragic finale I've seen in a long while. Esmerelda may have been saved from hanging, but the true \"hero\" of the story is neglected and abandoned in the highest reaches of the cathedral. His final sentiment, expressing the desire to be made of stone, is delivered with incredible poignancy by Laughton, and speaks of a lifetime of unimaginable isolation and desolation. This final line stresses the terrible irony of Quasimodo's predicament: as a stone chimera, however gruesome, his artistry would be celebrated by thousands of admirers {as he briefly experienced early in the film, when a frenetic crowd informally crowned him \"king\"}. However, more importantly, being made of stone would simply bring an end to his unspeakable pain, to the incessant aching of a heart that desires a woman he could never, and will never, have for himself.",

Although this story has been a staple of many generations, it returns to the silver screen ever so often to test the talents of up and coming Hollywood stars. Despite the fact that many notable actors have attempted the role, few do so adequately. Among the actors who have made the part memorable, the original challenge was Lon Chaney's. Another was Anthony Quinn, followed by Anthony Hopkins, and even Mandy Patinkin tried the twisted body. But in my opinion, the greatest performance of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was this one, personified by Charles Laughton. From the moment the audience and our hero meet, it's a test of endurance. Can we bare to look upon the ugly, misshapen-ed man, who's only crime was being born half made, hence the term \"Quasi\", or will we draw back in fear as people did in his century? The story bears repeating as the tale of a horribly disfigured child, born so repulsive, that Parisians left him to die on the steps of Notre Dame. Saved, adopted and trained as a bell-ringer, by the deeply troubled, but powerful Father Frollo (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), he becomes a on-going joke around Paris, to all concerned except Frollo. The bells made him deaf, but that does not stop him from falling in love with a beautiful Gypsy girl named Esmerald. (Maureen O'Hara) She unfortunately is in love with Phobeus, a handsome soldier of the king. However it is Gringoire (Edmond O'Brien) a poet and playwright who leads the group of admirers which includes Father Frollo, to see which one will end up possessing the girl, in a time when superstition possessed most of Europe. Unlikely as it sounds it's the bell-ringer who draws close first. An excellent adaptation of his story, Victor Hugo would have enjoyed this version best. *****",

The story revolves around a beautiful Gypsy woman, pleading for the rights of her people against pervasive anti-Gypsy prejudice--a problem in the Middle Ages as it was when the film was made in 1939.  (In real life, Hitler was just a couple of years away from attempting to exterminate the Gypsy people, which would leave some 200,000 to 300,000 Gypsies dead by the time this film was six years old.)  She is loved by practically every man who meets her, among them a grotesquely deformed bell-ringer, a starry-eyed itinerant singer/poet/writer, a dashing police captain, and the bitterly warped Chief Justice Frollo.  The acting is great, the characters are three-dimensional.  Laughton, with just a few grunts and grimaces, conveys all the sorrow and pathos and innocence and madness behind hunchback's mask-like face.  And one can feel sorry--almost--for the evil Frollo; there is indeed a human being down there somewhere, just as Esmeralda says.  The passions of the mob are realistic, as they vacillate between merciless sadism, sentimentalism, and a thirst for justice.  All these characters, and all the social and political forces of medieval Paris (and 19th-century Paris, and 1930's liberal Hollywood) come swirling together, and it's not always clear who's right and who's wrong, and the results are fascinating!",

                "text": "As an adaptation of Victor Hugo's 'Notre Dame de Paris', William Dieterle's 1939 film is itself malformed, a picturesque travesty twisted out of shape by the demands of the Hays Office. It is the chief source of the 1996 Disney animation of the same title, inheriting elements from Wallace Worsley's 1923 silent adaptation. *Some spoilers follow, as I wish to compare the book and the film, and refer to other film versions.* \n\n'Notre Dame de Paris' is a medi\u00e6val tragedy, dominated by Claude Frollo, the young Archdeacon unhinged by the conflict between his sexuality and his vows of celibacy. The Hays Code, which superseded the NAMPI 'Thirteen Points', forbade negative, controversial or disrespectful depictions of clergymen. As a result, this adaptation follows Worsley's 1923 film in rearranging the Frollo brothers to placate the Hays Office and the Catholic Legion of Decency. Claude Frollo (Walter Hampden) remains Archdeacon, but is a kindly old fellow, not the tormented young genius of the book. Instead, book-Claude's passion for Esm\u00e9ralda is transferred to his secular brother, Jehan (Cedric Hardwicke) \u0096 a spoilt teenaged student and party-animal in the novel, but here as a sexually repressed, politically repressive middle-aged judge and adviser to Louis XI. (To anyone who knows the book, the linkage of Jehan with repression of *any* kind is hilarious\u0085!) These portrayals directly influenced the 1996 Disney animation: indeed, Disney's 'Minister Claude Frollo' caricatures Hardwicke's chiselled features and chaperon. Hardwicke conveys film-Jehan's not-all-that-suppressed desires \u0096 in one scene in Notre Dame, he is clearly ogling Esm\u00e9ralda's cleavage while she is speaking to him (a rare trace of book-Jehan!) \u0096 but, as he is not under vows, there is no powerful plot-reason for him to deny them in the first place. (Amusingly, Hampden and Hardwicke later returned to 15C Paris as Louis XI and Tristan L'Hermite in 'The Vagabond King' (1956).) \n\nWithout the psychological conflict between religious vows and human passions, the core plot loses its raison d'\u00eatre. This adaptation therefore shoehorns in a 'political' conflict, making film-Jehan a persecutor of gypsies and a bitter opponent of intellectual freedom, as symbolised by the printing press, which he destroys. This seems to me a wilful misreading of book-Claude's pronouncement, \"Ceci tuera cel\u00e0\". Hugo extrapolates how the printed word will kill the 'stone books' of the cathedrals; literature will supersede architecture as an art; freedom of thought will triumph over ecclesiastical domination. In the novel, Claude seems to accept the inevitability of this, ambivalently but calmly. He is a man on the cusp of the Renaissance: a scientist and polymath, as well as a priest, who can see equally the dangers and the opportunities ahead. To make his screen incarnation (under whatever name) a violent opponent of the new learning, while presenting Louis XI as its champion, is a gross distortion. (This was taken to an even more ridiculous extreme in the 1997 US TV version, with Richard Harris's elderly Dom Claude a reactionary fanatic leading the smashing of printing presses, and Mandy Patinkin's Quasimodo a secret intellectual and author!) Only Delannoy's 1956 film, starring Alain Cuny as Claude, has made much of his alchemy. Pierre Gringoire (Edmond O'Brien) is transformed anachronistically from the amiable playwright and goat-fancier of the novel into a romantic young rebel, a radical satirist and political pamphleteer, who incurs film-Jehan's displeasure. He would fit more comfortably among the revolutionary students in 'Les Mis\u00e9rables'.\n\nAs in 1923, the use of the inaccurate popular English title again promotes the supporting character of Quasimodo to greater prominence. Charles Laughton's Quasimodo is thick-sliced Yorkshire ham. He is lugubrious and self-pitying, more like an elderly man than the young one the script acknowledges him to be during his trial. His prosthetics are overdone: a boy as severely deformed as this would have been unlikely to survive in 15C, and it is worth noting that, despite his misshapenness, Hugo's Quasimodo is notably agile. Anthony Quinn's 1956 portrayal was far more credible and vital. Laughton was, I think, simply unlucky with his casting in Hugo adaptations: in the Hays Code-pleasing bowdlerisation of 'Les Mis\u00e9rables', he had played Javert, when he would have been better as Jean Valjean (his physical bulk and presence are reminiscent of Harry Baur, the definitive film-Valjean), a role given instead to matin\u00e9e idol Frederic March.\n\nMaureen O'Hara makes a spirited and beautiful Esm\u00e9ralda, appropriately still in her teens, but nevertheless seems too intelligent and streetwise to have fallen for the duplicitous and caddish Ph\u009cbus (Alan Marshal). (Book-Esm\u00e9ralda is alarmingly gullible, given that she has been raised among thieves and cut-throats.) In this version, he is really killed, which weakens the story. Part of the horror of Esm\u00e9ralda's plight in the book is that he recovers from his wound, but refuses to clear her name or lift a finger to help her in any way \u0096 while she remains infatuated, precipitating the final tragedy by calling his name at the least opportune moment possible. Again, the Hays Code interfered in depicting injustice: individual officials could be depicted as wicked or corrupt, but the rule of law and authority itself must be upheld. Hence the film depicts the king as essentially benevolent, but badly advised by the hypocritical Jehan, who persecutes Esm\u00e9ralda for spurning his advances.\n\nThere is excellent work from the supporting cast, notably Thomas Mitchell as a wily Clopin Trouillefou, and the production values are good. I wonder whether the set of old Paris was the same one used for the 1923 silent version? The happy ending is a final bowdlerisation, far less powerful than that of the novel: of the cinema versions, only Delannoy's 1956 film has taken us into the charnel-house at Montfaucon. Pierre gets the girl, as well as the goat, and Quasimodo gazes down wistfully as they go off together. Perhaps this time, *he* should have run off with Djali as a consolation prize?",

Along with impressive sets, moody black and white photography and a powerful Alfred Newman score, this film remains a formidable artistic achievement.\n\nDespite Laughton's makeup delivering plenty of shock value, his character retains sympathy. The audience is denied the comfort of seeing Quasimodo as a creature that could not exist in real life. He is neither a supernatural being nor a creation of a mad scientist. Laughton's Quasimodo is an afflicted but real human being \u0096 a kindred spirit of the true-life Elephant Man. Laughton is barely recognisable \u0096 those who know his work may recognise him by the mole on his left cheek. \n\nIrish actress Maureen O'Hara in her Hollywood debut plays the other key figure in the story, Esmeralda. She fairly glows in this film, and has an effect on men not unlike the effect Cameron Diaz's character has on them in \"Something About Mary\". Males of all ages, hunchbacked or otherwise, are attracted to her. \n\nMany scenes stay in the memory. When Quasimodo is caught watching Esmeralda dancing during the Festival of Fools, his head is pushed through a hole on a stage to be evaluated by the crowd. Although great advances have been made in makeup and special effects since 1939, the first sight of Laughton's Quasimodo still has the power to shock. \n\nIn the film's most disturbing sequence, Quasimodo is whipped for attempting to abduct Esmeralda on the orders of his guardian. After his tunic is ripped away to expose his hump, he receives 50 lashes in a scene that is still brutal despite 70 intervening years of cinematic excess. The brutality is only relieved when Esmeralda steps forward to give him water. \n\nWhen Quasimodo attempts to hide his ugliness from Esmeralda in the bell tower of Notre Dame, it illustrates Laughton's ability to project a character through pounds of makeup. He also projected onto his character the way he felt about his own lack of physical attractiveness.\n\nLaughton searched within painful life experiences to inform his roles. He didn't have to look far for pain in this demanding film. Apparently the hours spent applying his makeup put a strain on Laughton's relationship with his makeup artists, and at some point, they humiliated Laughton by pinning him down and squirting soda water in his face. Laughton drew on such experiences to help him plumb the depths of Quasimodo's despair. \n\nIn my opinion, through Laughton's inspired performance and superb production values, the 1939 film eclipses all the other versions. Despite many remakes, this remains the definitive film version.",

Never again in the history of movies has the stable of character actors been so rich as it was in 1939. To paraphrase Norma Desmond, they made movies then! Enjoy enjoy enjoy!",

                "text": "I originally posted my review on www.movieforums.com, as TheGirlWhoHadAllTheLuck_ on the 14th October 2010.\n\nHunchback of Notre Dame (1939) \n\nThe story- a hunchback bell-ringer (Quasimodo) is shut away in his tower by his guardian, the brother of the Archdeacon of Notre Dame (Frollo). At the Festival of Fools, we meet a young poet/playwright (Gringoire) and a caddish soldier (Phoebus). All four men's hearts become entangled with a beautiful gypsy girl. Okay, it's not quite as simple as all that in the book. The novel is filled with history, architecture, lust, religion, love, and pretty gruesome deaths- very Gothic. So, how does the film fare?\n\nCharles Laughton gives real humanity to Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer who has been deafened by the ringing of his beloved bells (this is not a jolly story). Anything this guy loves ends up destroying him. Maureen O'Hara as Esmerelda doesn't look like a gypsy of Egyptian descent as Esmerelda is in the novel but she has a very tragic-sounding voice and she looks young enough and beautiful enough to have captured the hearts of four men. But Alan Marshal as Phoebus- the caddish soldier- is very dull. He's on for such a short amount of time that his presence is practically pointless and it is impossible to believe that Esmerelda would have been infatuated with this Phoebus, thus throwing a massive spanner into the works.\n\nThe two best performances are Edmund O'Brien as Gringoire, the poet/playwright, and Cedric Hardwicke as Jehan Frollo (for those of you who read the novel and are confused, I will explain in a minute). Gringoire is one of my favourite characters in the book and possibly the only character that isn't all doom and gloom. O'Brien plays his sensitivity and good-heartedness beautifully, plus he's pretty nice-looking, making it even more unbelievable that Esmerelda would fancy Phoebus. Any reader of the novel will be judging this film on the strength of the actor playing Frollo- a very complex character and incredibly hard to play. Hardwicke is brilliant as Frollo, looking suitably cold but tortured and burning inside for the love of Esmerelda.\n\nSo, how far does the film go with all the creepiness of the novel? Well, in the novel, Jehan Frollo is the younger drunkard brother of the Archdeacon Claude Frollo- Claude is the one who lusts after Esmerelda. Unfortunately the filmmakers either had to or chose to wuss out, thus taking away from the power of the novel. Unsurprisingly, they don't use the very gruesome ending of the novel (I think none of the films did, actually). Frollo's lust has been diluted by the director/screenplay writer, and Hardwick just isn't given enough screen time so that at some points I actually became annoyed with Quasimodo because Hardwick does Frollo's torture so well. The film often feels slow-paced with the crowd scenes and lots of the action in the novel has been cut. Although it is impressive, the film is not nearly as brooding or probing enough.\n\nThe Disney film takes a lot of its inspiration from this. Ironically, it manages to go further with the lust theme, making it very clear what Frollo wants from Esmerelda (and the Disney dance is overtly sensual whereas in the 1939 film, she just gets to skip around). Disney Frollo is actually a man of power, being a judge, so the hypocrisy theme is still kept. Although Quasimodo is cute in Disney, he's still cute in the 1939 film, taking away from his complexity. Frollo may be totally evil in Disney but in the 1939 film they also neglect to show the relationship between Frollo and Quasimodo, which is central to understanding the novel's complexity. So let's not be snobbish about the Disney film because the 1939 film isn't perfect either.\n\nIn conclusion, the film as a whole is a little slow-paced, favouring crowd scenes over personal scenes, but apart from Phoebus, the cast is top-notch, hence the reason why it gets four stars. And to be fair, it's an incredibly hard novel to film. Worth watching if you haven't got the stomach or the time for the novel. If you thought Wuthering Heights was creepy, wait until you read The Hunchback of Notre Dame...",

Quasimodo delights in his celebrity but is chastised by his church overseer Frollo who quickly brings and end to the frivolity. In a quick reversal of fortune he is sentenced to fifty lashes and now jeered instead of cheered by the same mob that crowned him. When the beautiful Esmeralda seeks sanctuary after being accused of murder Quasimodo takes up the cause to defend her. \n\nWhile Hunchback does follow and borrow some of its detail from the silent version it makes vast improvements in film grammar and production design as well as fleshing out characters and taking jabs at societal hypocrisy moving towards the brink. William Dieterle direction is crisp and sound whether handling big crowd scenes in celebration and riot or capturing the tragic nuances of Laughton and the stunning beauty of Maureen O'Hara's Esmeralda. Laughton's title character dominate the film but sharply edged supporting performances by Thomas Mitchell, Cedric Hardwicke and Henry Davenport as a more cerebral Louis XI take a lot of weight off of Quasimodo's back in balancing the production. With both cast and crew more than up to speed this Hunchback of Notre Dame remains the one to beat.",

Why must all major-studio movies be big-budget, dumbed down, lowest-common-denominator cotton candy for the brain? The story here is compelling and interesting. Hugo drew an intersection of history between the middle ages and the Enlightenment, with the printing press as green light. The people inhabiting his world move through this busy intersection not without incident. An evil clergyman, here in careful division as an evil magistrate and his brother, the other half of his ego, the good Archbishop. The ugly Quasimodo, with the heart aching for love and understanding. The beautiful Esmerelda, just trying to survive and help her people do the same. A kindly, logical king who embraces progress but still understands that a superstitious populace will want trial by ordeal. With a good story like this, it's no wonder this movie has been made so many times, yet this version is the definitive.\n\nCharles Laughton is flawless as Quasimodo. Your heart breaks for him, for how lonely he is, for how he longs for love. When he covers his face to speak to Esmerelda, it's so poignant. His spirit and kindness and determination to save her. His song while showing her his \"Friends\", the bells. His daring dash to rescue her from the noose, and his defiant \"SANCTUARY!\" The performance of a lifetime, and one of the best ever on film.\n\nMaureen O'Hara is not superficial. Her heart is of course as beautiful as her face, but she is not portrayed as a pure innocent; rather, as a woman with desires and passion. She longs to gain justice for her people. This has yet to be achieved, but in the celluloid fantasy, they are admitted to Paris at last.\n\nThe story is complex and multi-layered, something we seldom see in mainstream films today. The cinematography is very good and the music is amazing. This is an essential for those who love the art of cinema, and those who just love a great story alike.",

                "text": "The 1939 Hollywood version of \"the Hunchback of Notre Dame\" is without a doubt the finest film adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel \"Notre Dame de Paris\". Visually stunning, technically ahead of its time with memorable casting and a powerful direction together create a beautiful historical drama that overshadows all the other adaptations of the story.\n\nDirector William Dieterle has obviously wanted to make everything better than it was in Hollywood's first film version of \"Notre Dame\" back in 1923. The film is filled with spectacular scenes. In no other versions has the Feast of Fools, Court of Miracles, Esmeralda giving water to Quasimodo, Esmeralda's saving from the gallows and Quasimodo defending Notre Dame from angry mob- scenes been so lavishly presented. The sets of the 15'Th century Paris and Notre Dame Cathedral are pure Hollywood gold. This film has also been an obvious inspiration to many of the later film adaptations, like the two TV films from 1982 and 1997, as well as Disney's 1996 animation. Quasimodo's famous line \"Why was I not made of stone like thee?\" especially has been repeated in almost every version.\n\nWord of caution though; the fans of Victor Hugo's book should not think that \"best adaptation\" also equals \"most faithful adaptation\". Like the 1923 version, this too has gotten quite a makeover, makers obviously didn't want to make a tragedy where all the characters die. This is the first version that creates a romance between Esmeralda and a poet Gringoire, who in more faithful versions usually appears as comical relief of the film. This film also didn't want to present the priest as a villain so, like in the 1923 version, archdeacon Claude Frollo is a good man, whereas his brother Jehan is the bad guy. To still be close to Hugo, Jehan in this version has been made Chief Justice of Paris, a position later given to Claude in Disney version.\n\nRarely does one see a film that has such a great casting as this one. Charles Laughton is the most well-known actor to play Quasimodo. Though I personally prefer the performances of Lon Chaney and Anthony Hopkins over Laughton, that is not to say that he would be bad. Laughton makes his Quasimodo a gentle, kind character with an almost poetic soul trapped in a horribly deformed body. Laughton's performance has been an inspiration to many later actors trying the role and his physical look was copied almost completely to the Disney version character. Thomas Mitchell gives the most powerful performance of Clopin ever. His King of the Beggars is hot blooded, realistic man of the action who knows every trick in the book. Out of all more heroic Gringoire's ever made to films, Edmond O'Brien is the only one who really nails the part. In minor roles Walter Hampden as the Archdeacon Claude and Harry Davenport as King Louis XI are doing great job.\n\nStill, for me the real stars of this movie are Maureen O'Hara and Cedric Hardwicke. O'Hara is quite simply the best Esmeralda ever to appear on screen. Beautiful yet innocent and somewhat naive girl, who cares deeply for her people and has enough heart to see more in Quasimodo than just his looks. No other actress has been as enchanting and moving in the role as she. As the Judge Frollo, Hardwicke creates a cold man of authority with a strong prejudice against gypsies. Yet when he becomes obsessed of Esmeralda, you can see a tremendous conflict happening in him, until he decides that he must either have her or be rid of her. Hardwicke shows all this with his eyes while still keeping the cool composure. The scenes where he tries to get Esmeralda to come with him and later when he confesses to his archdeacon brother that he killed Phoebus (yes, in the version Phoebus dies) are acting in finest.\n\nAlthough certainly very freely adapted version of Hugo's book, this 1939 version is still the best of them all. For those wanting to see more faithful film of the book, turn your attention to the 1956 version.",

As Frollo in this excellent version of Victor Hugo's novel, he is definitely a standout. The whole film is very well done. Laughton as Quasimodo is memorable, but it is Sir Cedric who steals the show with his fascinating portrayal of the wretched monk. It is one of the greatest of all film performances. I've seen several versions of Hugo's novel where Frollo is portrayed as a decadent pervert whose sole purpose in life is to possess the body of Esmeralda. This is not how Hugo wrote his character, nor is this how Hardwicke portrayed Frollo. As a matter of fact, Frollo is a much more fascinating character than Quasimodo. I'm not saying that Quasimodo isn't a character worthy of attention. Far from it... Frollo just has more meat and depth to who he is. He is not a completely despicable character. He's actually a decent man whose sole fault has to do with his repressed sexual lust. He's very intelligent in an intellectual sense, and he does care for people. After all, he adopted Quasimodo when the rest of the world cast him away. The appearance of Esmeralda simply awakened in him a \"detested feeling\" (For him sex was disgusting in an Augustinian sense) which lay dormant and which eventually possessed him. Hardwicke was able to convey not only the obsessively passionate part of Frollo but also the pitiable side. Overall, it was a performance that lingers in the mind long after the movie has ended. Check out Hardwicke's other role as Bishop Bienvenue in Hugo's Les Miserables (1935). Forget the musical version. That's just modern day noise and fireworks. These two performances (As Frollo in \"The Hunchback\" and Bishop Bienvenue in \"Les Miserables\") in Hugo adaptations are the best ever captured on film.

Charles Laughton's performance here is one the finest (I think THE finest)ever put on film. Its both sad and amazing this was amongst the incredible movies of 1939. Sad because it doesn't get quite as much renown and respect as it deserves, being in that group. Thats true of many other very fine films that year, most of which would've been hands-down, obvious winners for Best Picture in other years. Its amazing that a black and white shines so bright against the wonderful Technicolor films of that year like The Wizard of Oz and GWTW.

I got around to watching this 1939 version, starring Charles Laughton as Quasimodo, very recently. Yes, it is rather long, and the longer a film is, the harder it is to keep it from wearing thin. However, even though this 1939 film does have some problems, and for me, staying into it was a struggle at times, it works well enough for the most part.\n\nSet in France during the late 15th century, a young gypsy named Esmeralda comes to the church. When she sees the severely disfigured bell ringer, Quasimodo, she begins to flee. Frollo, the Chief Justice, sends Quasimodo after Esmeralda, and after he catches her, he is found with her and captured. The church bell ringer is sentenced to be publicly flogged, and after fifty lashes, he is to remain tied in the square for an hour. During the hour following the flogging, he begs for water, and Esmeralda is the one who gives it to him. Because of this, he falls in love with the young gypsy. Later, Esmeralda falls in love with Phoebus, but Frollo becomes jealous and murders him! Sadly, the innocent Esmeralda is accused of this murder and sentenced to be hanged, but several people, including Quasimoto, attempt to save her.\n\nOne problem I noticed with this 1939 film is that I've seen films with better scripts, though I've definitely seen worse ones as well. I also noticed a bit of overacting. Fortunately, these two issues are far from enough to ruin the entire film, as this adaptation of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" also has its merits. Some of the dialogue may be a tad poor, but some of it is good, which definitely helps. Charles Laughton's performance in the film really stands out, and I would say there are other impressive performances as well, including Maureen O'Hara as Esmeralda. I certainly can't forget how moving the story is at times, especially towards the end, which was when I really got a lump in my throat, feeling very sorry for Quasimodo! I might even go as far as to say it becomes stunning late in the film! Mainly for that, it was one unforgettable experience for me!\n\nI have to be honest, here, I've never read the book, so I don't know how faithful this adaptation is to it. I'm sure there are some differences, but it seems to be fairly popular with those who have read Hugo's famous novel. Judging this adaptation of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" as a film, not as an adaptation of a book, I have to give it credit for its merits. It certainly is a downer (I know the book is as well), and overall, it works well as such. Since this is such a dark, depressing film, it's not the kind I would want to watch over and over again, but it was worth at least one viewing, that's for sure! This 1939 adaptation of the story doesn't seem to be one of the most well remembered movies of its time, and I think it deserves more recognition.",

The impact of my first viewing has resonated over the decades only to become more flavorful as age has honed my appetite for quality. From the first scene the \"celebration of fools\" to the last with Laughtons incomparable, soul rending line...\" Why was I not made of stone like thee\" I am amazed. Every facet of this gem of classical Hollywood scripting, direction, and acting, not to mention the casting which was superlative in the extreme, was a mesh made in Heaven for a seeker of all that is finest in film.\n\nMaureen O'Hara was at the height of her beauty...and for a woman who was outstandingly beautiful throughout her career that is saying something. Vulnerable and suggestively innocent as the mesmerizing Gypsy girl, her prayer to the Virgin is a priceless moment of selflessness, but she was still a girl subject to the untested and unproven emotions of youth. Her desire for a handsome officer who dallies with her heart, and her fear and misunderstanding of something \"loathesome\", until she is forced by circumstance to tolerate its presence, is almost her undoing. She is a victim of intolerant, superstitious times, of her race, sex, and beauty, constantly subjugated to the whims of predatory men, cruel intentions, and laws for the crime of her mere existence and the effect she has on those around her.\n\nEdmond O'Brien as Grangroire was sheer poetry and sensitivity. Never has O'Brien been more handsome. The fireplace lighting scene is one of my favorites in cinema, and his subjection to the near impossible task of surviving the \"jingling man\" in the Beggars Court is quite a moment. Grangoire combines the need for Justice that all are seeking with the implacable heart of a literate man who believes the system will \"do the right thing\" given the opportunity...and he sets out to change his world with his mind and his words with unflinching conviction. \n\nThomas Mitchell as Clopin is looking for Justice too as leader of the Guild of Thieves and Beggars, and a manly figure he strikes. He is a leader of men in every sense of the word and one can understand easily why he instills a sense of purpose in those he influences for he is a passionate man of action. One of the saddest moments in this film, and one of the injustices of passions aroused on behalf of Esmeralda, is the response of Quasimodo to the storming of Notre Dam by the citizens, beggars, and craftsmen of Paris trying to save Esmeralda from the authorities. How was Quasimodo to understand? So many lives lost for the same purpose....but that is one of the ironies of this tale. \n\nLaughton infuses Quasimodo, the wretched refuse of this pitiless society, with an air of dignity that is startling. Unlike the hulking and sullenly humorous Quasimodo of Anthony Quinn in the 50's Laughtons Quasimodo is naive, childlike, and humble, and confused. Unskilled, uneducated, and isolated, what chance had he to understand the rabble below? His perspective from his tower would be as ours looking down upon ants below us. His experience of them and their world was one of being subjected to humiliation, incivilities, and abuse ....they were a thing to be feared, objects of curiosity and longing infused with a sense of sadness so mortifying that it could almost not be endured. And what a cruel blow to his already tortured soul to have to choose to kill Dam Frollo, the only person in his world that had \"saved\" him as an infant from certain death, to save Esmeralda from certain death. Quasimodos \"awakening\" to the realities of life \"as a monster who is also a man\" with the first stirrings of an impossible love for Esmeralda is heartbreaking. His rescue of Esmeralda from the rope is one of my favorite moments in cinema for he alone can \"physically' do, by will , determination, strength, and the sanctity of his home, what Grangoire with all of his fervent hope and belief cannot do in time to save her life. The one shot of Grangoire's relief and elation at this rebellious act is joyous. What a moment....for me...worth seeing the whole film for, if not for ALL the other memorable and glowing moments. \n\nSir Cedric as Dam Frollo .....scintillating performance, such understated finesse. From pious protector of Quasimodo, Frollo descends to the nature of the true monster of the story. He is a deeply conventional, pious and religious man caught in the inescapable clutches of his own uncontrollable desires, his feelings of lust for Esmeralda. How can he allow his sinful nature and Esmeralda to coexist in his universe? If he must feel these desires he Must have her. If he cannot have her He cannot allow her to live to haunt him. His weakness has betrayed him. His only way out is to kill the thing he desires and because he does not LOVE this \"thing\", who has rejected him as a MAN, it is easy to subject her to torture and death, for he sees himself as tortured by her. He justifies in his own mind her \"witchery\" to absolve his own evil nature and crimes...and thus transforms himself into Her savior, for to kill a witch was to save souls.\n\nThe issues in this great story are subtle, BOLD, and passionate. To the more ardent heart the romanticism will thrill and delight. To the most erudite the content is meat at a feat of delicacies. Truly one of the Greatest films in cinematic history. Unlike the Hugo story this film does not end with the complete sorrow of the literary masterpiece....Thank you cinema Gods for this film and its vision!!!!!",

I'm not sure the idea of \"Clopin's\" defeating \"the royals\" could have been accomplished by the occupation of the cathedral was too clever, but the crowd of beggars before the great church was genius.\n\nNO ONE paid any attention to the \"trivia\" dept. - Hitler invaded Poland the same year the first Cannes Festival was held. \"Hunchback\" was the only film shown that year ! - nor did anyone mention that gypsies were victimized by Hitler's regime, also, continuing their harassment after centuries of being outcast. The Catholic Church had its grip on Europe's population for centuries - it wasn't about to let-go.\n\nIt's a miracle these great ole films are being re-released in media people use today - VHS and DVD. Bring them all on ! Let us revel in the \"tinsel-town\" of Hollywood - almost every other country in the world is trying to copy it. These countries contribute many talents to make movies better, but it was in Hollywood the formula was created. \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" - all of whose stars went on to long careers - proves that a great setting, and imagination from a classical novel, can produce entertainment for the ages.\n\nQuasimodo's yearning to be like the stone-figurines on the cathedral is a heartbreaker - watch it again and it'll be 10s all the way.",

                "text": "Some years ago I saw the silent version of this story, starring Lon Chaney, Sr. in the title role of Quasimodo, and was completely taken with it, although I have to confess to not being particularly familiar with Victor Hugo's novel. This, of course, has a very different feel than a silent movie would have, and for sheer entertainment value I have to say that I preferred the 1923 version more. Having said that, I wouldn't at all want to suggest that this is anything other than a very good movie. Probably because of voice, it offers greater reflection on a variety of issues that were present in the 1923 movie (and, presumably, in the novel) but were less fleshed out just because of the medium.\n\nFrom the very beginning we're introduced to racism (or, at least, nationalism) as it's revealed that gypsies have been forbidden to enter Paris without formal permission. Some do make it in, of course, including Esmeralda (played by Maureen O'Brien), who becomes the main engine who moves the story forward, as she's either pursued or admired by a variety of men, including the Hunchback. There's the issue of sanctuary introduced, as both Esmeralda and the Hunchback enjoy the protection of the church. How many limits can be placed on the concept of \"sanctuary\" - and, if any limits at all are placed on it, is there really a concept of sanctuary? There's the obvious reflection on class struggles in 16th century Paris, as the nobility, the townspeople and the beggars find themselves clashing - ironically in the case of the latter two, who were really fighting for the same thing: the enforcement of sanctuary, which also gives us an introduction to the problem of a mob mentality, as people begin to be fighting for the sake of fighting. What's the role of the King (Louis XI, played by Harry Davenport) - a thought that came to me as the nobility prepared a document to \"force\" the King to have Esmeralda executed? Do they consider themselves above the King? 16th century France was not a constitutional monarchy like, say, 21st century Britain. If the King could be so easily controlled by the nobility then what was the purpose of having a King? And, of course, in the depiction of the relationships between Esmeralda and her various interested suitors, there are a variety of takes on love and what it means. As I said, most of this was present in the 1923 version, but could be fleshed out more fully in a \"talkie.\"\n\nI enjoyed Charles Laughton's performance as Quasimodo. For me, Laughton's signature performance will continue to be Captain Bligh from 1935's \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" but he handled this role well, and made Quasimodo a sympathetic character - as he must be if the story is going to work. It was a limited role in terms of dialogue, but he captured it well - perhaps not quite the equal of Chaney's '23 performance, but quite good. His makeup was effective, and I understand that Laughton took the role so seriously that he actually went to great lengths to experience some of Quasimodo's pain as scenes were being shot. O'Hara (who I know primarily from 1947's \"Miracle On 34th Street\") also handled the role of Esmeralda quite well. Davenport's take on Louis XI was interesting - not how I would have expected the King to be portrayed. Much gentler, kinder and more concerned with the lower classes than I think would have been realistic. The movie also featured Thomas Mitchell as Clopin (not as effective as Ernest Torrence in 1923) and Cedric Hardwicke as Frollo, who offered a dark and almost creepy take on Frollo.\n\nDeeper and more reflective than the silent version, I still felt that it fell short of that version in entertainment value, but it's very good nonetheless.

                "summary": "A favorite film, despite some gross implausibilities in the last part.",
                "text": "Quite a memorable adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel, written more than century before. I've seen it quite a few times over the years. Hugo's main purpose in writing this novel, which he titled simply \"Notre Dame de Paris\", was to promote preservation of surviving Gothic architecture, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame, in and around which is the site of action in this film. Some changes were made in the details of the main characters and the plot: most notably the survival of the two main characters: Esmeralda: the beautiful gypsy girl about which all the drama centers, and the grossly deformed Quasimodo, whose very hunched back was but one of several physical deformities, making him generally regarded as a monster, to be shunned. In the book, Esmeralda is hanged as a presumed witch and murderer, and the grief-stricken Quasimodo commits to death at her gravesite. Presumably, this was thought too tragic an ending for a general film audience. Thus, the parting scenes have Esmeralda being carried off, in triumph, along with her poet husband Gringoire, while Quasimodo remains perched on the edge of his bell tower, uttering the line \"Why wasn't I made of stone, like thee\", talking to a grotesque figurine on the bell tower rim. Of course, he is lamenting his human desire for female companionship, specifically with Esmeralda.\n\nThe main characters are nearly all members of one of two groups residing within Paris: the political and clerical elite, or various virtual outcasts, including Quasimodo, the gypsy Esmeralda, residents of the 'Court of Miracles', and the reform-minded poet Gringoire, who forms a loose association with the 'Court of Miracles' and Esmeralda, as possible accomplices in engineering reform. the 'Court of Miracles' was an actual large slum area in the Paris of the 15th century: the lawless abode of beggars, thieves, prostitutes and some students. It was so named because of the many residents who went to other parts of Paris, faking disabilities, returning home daily to discard their 'disability'. Thomas Mitchell plays their unofficial leader: rather like a pirate captain. These two general groups do not always act antagonistically in unison. For example, at one point, a group from the 'Court of Miracles' is preparing to hang Gringoire, saved only by Esmeralda's reluctant agreement to marry him, although she didn't then love him. By the end of the film, she claimed to love him as her husband. In the meanwhile, two members of the power elite have found themselves lusting after her: Captain Phoebus, who saved her from the clutches of the abducting Quasimodo, and Jehan Frollo, the sinister Archdeacon of Notre Dame. She fancies she's in love with the dashing Phoebus, who is already betrothed to the beautiful and wealthy Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier. Presumably, his idea is that Esmeralda will be his secrete mistress. However, Jehan soon murders him from jealousy, then spitefully accuses Esmeralda of this deed, as well as being a witch in causing himself to lust for her. She is sentenced to be hung.\n\nNow comes a series of quite implausible actions by Quasimodo, trying to save Esmeralda from being killed. First, he swings down, Tarzan-like, on a rope from a scaffolding outside the Cathedral(a bell rope, in the book!), to grab Esmeralda off her hangman's scaffolding, and swing back up to the higher scaffolding! They then climb up to the bell tower for safety. However, Jehan has the sanctuary right of the Cathedral nullified. Thus, a crowd of 'citizens of Paris', apparently composed of artisans and merchants, gather outside the cathedral to protest the sanctuary nullification. But they are soon overwhelmed by a much larger mob from the 'Court of Miracles', who say they doubt the intentions of the first group. According to an excerpt from the book, this rabble was probably more interested in stealing valuables from within the Cathedral, should they succeed in breaking in. Unfortunately, Quasimodo gets the mistaken impression that the mob has come to hang Esmeralda. Thus, he maneuvers a series of loose stone beams or other heavy stone objects to the edge of the bell tower, to be dropped on the mob(Why were these loose stone objects present?). Then he tips a huge cauldron of boiling liquid(soup?), which runs out the mouths of the grotesque gargoyles, onto the crowd, scalding some to death.(Why was this cauldron present, and how did he heat it so??). Meanwhile, the mob is using one of the dropped beams as a battering ram to punch through the cathedral door, while Jehan is chasing Esmeralda around the bell tower, with the presumed intention of raping her, then taking her to be hanged. Quasimodo now joins this chase, as the king's soldiers arrive to disperse the mob. He catches Jehan and hurls him to the plaza. Gringoire now arrives with the news that the king has pardoned Esmeralda as innocent of crimes, and has decreed the end of gypsy persecution throughout France(with contemporary relevance to the persecution of Jews and gypsies by the Nazis and other groups in Europe).\n\nCharles Laughton is superb in eliciting a combination of repulsion and pity in the audience. Ironically, Quasimodo's lifelong guardian, Jehan, is a psychological monster, in some respects, complementing Quasimodo's physical monstrosities. The film doesn't bring out the fact that, in the book, Quasimodo was an abandoned gypsy, while Esmeralda was stolen by gypsies as an infant, thus explaining her non-gypsy appearance.",

Quasimoto is flogged in the town square and only Esmeralda shows mercy by giving him water. Esmeralda is invited to dance for a grand party. Phoebus is flirting with Esmeralda and then next, Phoebus is found stabbed to death. Jehan admits to the stabbing to his brother archdeacon Claude Frollo and railroads her for bewitching him. Esmeralda is convicted of the murder and sentenced to hang. Clopin, Gringoire and Quasimoto all try to save her.\n\nThe movie comes alive whenever Charles Laughton's Quasimodo comes on the screen. He embodies so much humanity. He is so pitiful in the hands of the fickle crowd. Newcomer 19 year old Maureen O'Hara is beautiful and shows real power acting opposite Laughton. Cedric Hardwicke is a solid villain. The movie suffers a little whenever Quasimodo isn't on the screen. It's not as good but only by comparison. The production is grand with large crowds and sets.

This is a masterpiece of cinema thanks to several elements forming a flawless wholesome, including mesmerizing acting performances from the ensemble cast, the impressive German expressionist influences in cinematography and several astoundingly staged sequences with large crowds of people. I'm a big admirer of Lon Chaney Sr. and have a lot of respect for his 1923 silent version of the story (especially since he performed quite a bit of dangerous acrobatics) but this film simply is more accessible, absorbing and attractive. This version truly brings the France of the 15th Century back to life; with all its progressive inventions (like the art of book printing) and the slow development of scientific wisdom (the Earth actually could be round instead of flat!). What I loved most about William Dieterle's \"The Hunchback of the Notre Dame\" is the magnificent cast of characters. With his incredibly performance and the stunning physical transformation he underwent, Charles Laughton's Quasimodo is definitely one of the most fascinating icons in cinematic history, but the film is chock-full of other fascinating characters as well. The genuinely gold-hearted gypsy girl Esmeralda, for example, who marries an untalented poet to prevent him from getting executed and who brings water to the publicly scandalized Quasimodo even though he abducted her. Another great character is King Louis XI. As depicted by Harry Davenport, he surely is the most appealing royal character I ever saw in a movie. King Louis is human, compassionate, upright and quite avant-garde considering his age! But the most fascinating character \u0096 apart from Quasimodo the bell ringer, of course \u0096 is , inevitable, the villain of the story. Sir Cedric Hardwicke masterfully depicts Frollo; the chief of justice and loyal counselor of the King. But Frollo falls madly in love with the gypsy woman Esmeralda and commands Quasimodo, the bell-ringer of the beautiful Notre Dame cathedral, to kidnap her. Quasimodo fails and Esmeralda is saved by the chief of guards Phoebus, with whom she falls in love, much against the will of numerous men in Paris. During a nightly encounter, Frollo stabs Phoebus to death and frames Esmeralda for the murder. She is soon sentenced to torture and death by hanging, but then several men come into action to save her. Quasimodo spectacularly rescues her from the noose and gives her sanctuary high up in the Notre Dame. Meanwhile, the king of the gypsies Clopin organizes a large-scaled mob manifestation to free Esmeralda and her poet husband Gringoire uses the new printing techniques to persuade King Louis to release her. \"The Hunchback of the Notre Dame\" is a visually as well as emotionally engaging experience and it is truly one of the greatest Hollywood movies ever accomplished (albeit directed by a German expressionist genius). The film was nominated for two Oscars, but should have won all of them. I guess that wasn't an option in the same year with landmarks like \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Stagecoach\" as fellow contenders. Even though this certainly doesn't qualify as a horror movie, it must be said that the make-up effects on Charles Laughton are breathtaking, and genre fans should still keep an eye open for horror veterans George Zucco and Rondo Hatton that appear in smaller supportive roles.",

The only thing I can compare this to is the Disney version. This is by far the better, if there is one area where that surpasses this. While that one was sugared up terribly(whereas this one only messes up the very ending by way of rendering it too sweet and audience-pleasing), it did have an actual gypsy as Esmeralda. O'Hara was quite attractive in this, and otherwise convincing, but she is clearly white. Quasimodo is effectively built up, the make-up is marvelous(they really made him hideous... and no, the legs do give it away, and the fat-suit isn't as good as they are today, still, it's great), he isn't the lead(he isn't meant to be; the common international title is a mistranslation of the original), he speaks little and Laughton manages to bring him to life in his careful energy and passion, without losing the clear image of a scared boy who has never been allowed into the outside world. You really feel sympathy for him, and hatred for Frollo. The performances are impeccable. This takes place in Paris, sometime after 1453. After a dancing girl becomes the subject of a judge's obsession a few men try to protect her, including the bell-ringer of the church. The climax, set to the powerful tones of the bells of the breathtaking Notre Dame is chilling. In general this favors action and spectacle over atmosphere; it succeeds in being immensely dramatic, tense, emotionally engaging, downright gripping. There are chases and this has an epic scope, aided by the grand score(and it should be noted that this uses silence remarkably well, too). The fair is swiftly edited and chaotic. This is an awe-inspiring, Gothic masterpiece. The plentiful dialog is mostly spot-on; this was back when people spoke their thoughts aloud in fiction. There are fantastic points, well presented(such as the one I quote in my summary), if the message is a bit obvious and hammered into us(it is important, though). It is a beautiful movie, and it is touching, not sappy. An important theme treated here is love, especially unrequited, and what it does to people. There is some silly humor, and black comedy. The lighting is amazing. There is violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with both the original b&w version and a colorized one(yup, Ted Turner hit this with his crayolas... it came out fine; it really doesn't need it), a trailer for it and the original posters. I recommend this to any fan of the medium of cinema. It rings true, it keeps your eyes glued to the screen, and it proves that even in its infancy, film could be excellent. 8/10",

This story has been so widely interpreted, a deviation from the original work is almost a given - and, this particular version of the novel has arguably replaced Hugo's own as standard. But, in the long run, interpretation will be how anything survives - and, after all, we'll always have Paris. The changes herein do work out well, although the story does seem to veer perilously close to \"Beauty and the Beast\" at times. It also seems more British than French - and subtly German, too.\n\nCharles Laughton's \"Quasimodo\" rings true, despite two make-up/costume appliances that have not - it must be said - aged well. Maureen O'Hara (as Esmeralda) comes on with a stunning, Garbo-level beauty - she affirmatively answers the film's line, \"Doesn't she make your pulse beat faster?\" The rest of the cast is exemplary, from the expectedly devilish Harry Davenport (as Louis XI) to the finely debuting Edmond O'Brien (as Pierre Gringoire). Alfred Newman's musical score was one of only two \"Academy Award\" nominations. It doesn't sound like much (considering Mr. Newman was nominated practically annually) - but, a few of the categories this film might have been competitive in weren't around back then.\n\n******** The Hunchback of Notre Dame (12/31/39) William Dieterle ~ Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara, Edmond O'Brien, Harry Davenport",

                "text": "I simply don't understand why everyone praises this movie to such an insane degree. One of the reviews calls it \"the peak of art in Hollywood cinema\" and another \"one of the best Hollywood movies ever\". Uh...really? Have you watched it recently? Sure, the technical achievements are great. The set of Notre Dame looks breathtaking and huge. And sure, it has a great story to work with, but they're already basing it on one of the best books I've ever read. As an adaptation of Hugo's novel, and as a standalone movie, it does a forgettable job.\n\nLet's begin by saying something positive about the movie: Charles Laughton's performance as Quasimodo. He dominates this movie in every scene. Not only is the makeup fantastic, but you can feel the pain and misery of this classically tragic character every time he utters a line, or even just looks at the camera. If it weren't for Laughton, I'd have given this movie far lower than a 5. Every other actor is forgettable. Esmeralda is an awkward Maureen O'Hara early in her career. Never mind that she looks NOTHING like a gypsy, but her performance is standard and rather boring. O'Hara would become a good actress in the 40s and would sadly pass away in 2015, but this early work is nothing special. Cedric Hardwicke takes the complex, brooding, conflicted character of Frollo, and turns him into a generic, racist bigot. He and Quasimodo have no connection whatsoever. The complicated interactions of characters that gave the book its intensity and drama are not to be found here.\n\nMaybe the reason I dislike this movie is because the book raised my expectations. I suspect those unfamiliar with the story, being exposed to it for the first time, would enjoy this movie quite a bit, simply for the fact that it's a great story. But as far as adaptations go, there are better ones. Even the Disney movie, in my opinion, better captures the spirit of the book. Rather than manifesting itself as a stiff, stunted poor man's version of the Hugo novel, the Disney version has its own dark tone and identity, and it works. Minus the singing Jason Alexander gargoyles.\n\nOne might say that it was very good at the time. After all, it came out nearly eighty years ago. But look at what else was released in 1939. The Wizard of Oz. Gone With the Wind. And one year before that, The Adventures of Robin Hood. Two years before, La Grande Illusion. All of those are masterpieces, with better acting, smarter scripts, and greater depth.\n\nLike all versions of \"Hunchback\", this one creates a world of ignorance and bigotry, where laws are based on millennia-old traditions and petty prejudices triumph over logic. It succeeds in creating this world, though it feels particular ham-handed. In one scene, the King asks some of his courtiers about Christopher Columbus's voyage around the world, to which they exclaim that the world is so obviously flat, and Columbus is such a fool. Even though the fact that the world is round was common knowledge in Europe since the time of the ancient Greeks. And every crowd in this movie is absolutely temperamental. One minute, they worship Quasimodo as a king; the next, they call for his death; then, when he saves Esmeralda, they cheer again. The gypsies seem to love Gringoire at first (an incredibly pointless character, I might add, even in the book, where he's just Victor Hugo's self-insert) and then prepare to execute him. The movie is disorganized and clumsy, taking the romanticized, Gothic tone of the book and making it absurd.\n\nThis movie has some great moments. Laughton's performance. The grand set of Notre Dame. The intense final climax where gypsies invade the cathedral. But the rest of it is utter crap, and I say that without a moment's hesitation. Therefore, it evens out. If you hate Disney, hate reading, and want to see a pretty faithful adaptation of the story, feel free to watch it. Otherwise, I would pass on this one, check out \"Hunchback\" at the library, and dive into the dark, complex story that Victor Hugo created.",

                "text": "An outstanding Hollywood epic from Victor Hugo's classic novel. I haven't read the novel so I'm in no position to carp on any differences between the book and the movie. I do know that Esmeralda gets hanged in the book. Not that it matters much. It's impossible to transpose a work from one medium to another with any accuracy, so if a happy ending is forced upon the story, so what? I like happy endings better.\n\nIn this case it's hard to see how improvements could be made in this story of love, class distinctions, and conflicts between the old, hierarchical religious order and the emerging rebirth of ideas.\n\nMaureen O'Hara, in her first American movie, is Esmeralda, the compassionate immigrant dancing girl attuned to nature, a gypsy with soul. Every man who meets her falls in love with her. And why not? Maureen O'Hara was 18 or 19 when this was shot, and she looks and acts bewitching. Maybe she IS a witch.\n\nSir Cedric Hardwicke is Frollo, the powerful Arch Deacon of Paris. He's a priest but no matter. He falls for her too, and he murders a soldier with whom O'Hara is infatuated. Half nuts with jealousy and rage, he oversees her trial and ensures that she is condemned to hang in the public square before Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nShe is saved at the last minute by Charles Laughton as Quasimodo, the deformed and deaf bell ringer who lives high up in the towers of Notre Dame. Laughton sneaks her into the church and she is given sanctuary there.\n\nThen there is Edmond O'Brien as one of those impoverished young scholars, \"trained in the seven liberal arts.\" Why are those arts called \"liberal,\" hey? Somebody call Glenn Beck. O'Brien believes he can save O'Hara by printing a pamphlet calling for her pardon. The plea is brought to the king's attention and it works, but, as in all bureaucracies, the wheels grindeth slowly.\n\nEnter the Beggars of Paris, a kind of occupational guild, led by their \"king\", Thomas Mitchell. They intend to rescue O'Hara from the soldiers they mistakenly believe are about to violate the rule of sanctuary, capture O'Hara, and carry out the sentence. The beggars are well-intentioned but impulsive, prone to violence, and, generally speaking, stupid. When they try to break into Notre Dame to whisk O'Hara off to safety, Laughton disperses the massive crowd by means of wooden beams, dropped bricks, and molten metal poured from the belfry. It's a pretty horrible scene.\n\nDid I mention that Maureen O'Hara is gorgeous? Yes, I think I did. Edmond O'Brien is curiously thin and a little handsome but overacts egregiously, as in a silent film. Hardwicke is unrelenting in his evil. He never laughs. He never smiles. He never even blinks. The king is inclined towards peace with order. He follows the rules and is a bit dotty.\n\nBut it's Laughton's picture. At his first appearance, he's grabbed by the crowd and a soldier tries to put a cardboard crown of fools on his head. Without a word, Laughton squints at him and then his head suddenly darts forward like a snake's and he tries to bite the soldier! He doesn't have that many lines but he imbues all of them with the pathos of a creature who is a rude lump of foul deformity with the soul of a romantic. In his final shot, forgotten by the crowd below, he snuggles against one of the cathedral's gargoyles and moans in his slurred, spittle-filled way, through false protruding teeth, \"Why wasn't I made of stone like you?\" It's one of those massive \"classics\" that came out of Hollywood during this period. The hundreds of extras must have kept the PAs and the ADs jumping. Crowds all march in step, sing in synch, and dance riotously. There's a good deal of intrigue and several narrative threads are underway at the same time, but no viewer is likely to be confused. Did I say Maureen O'Hara is enthralling and, alone, is reason enough to watch the movie? I might have.",

Generally though, it is a good production, with an ample amount of well-visualised sequences to atone for the messiness of the busier scenes.

After all, we have heard the terms: Quarterback, Halfback, Fullback, Scatback, Wingback, Tailback, Running Back, Brokeback (!!??), Blocking Back and Cornerback; why not include Hunchback in this grouping? And its veracity of context is further supported with the addition of \"Notre Dame\" with the term. What could be more 'American than \"The Hunchback (Football Player) of Notre Dame (Fighting Irish)?

In that regards, it would serve us all well to study and emulate the application and mastery of the Queen's English as practiced by the late William F. Buckley, Jr.\n\nSO, I was wrong! It happens to the best of us, at least once in a while. We got, instead of a Leather-Helmet Era College picture, a drama of the 15th Century from the French Novel \"Notre Dame of Paris\" by Victor Hugo. And all we can say about this is , \"Lucky us!\" OUR STORY\u0085\u0085\u0085It is to the Paris of the 15th Century that we find ourselves being taken to and find it to be a wondrous World; which is filled with innovation, invention and change. And yet it is a World that finds its feet planted firmly in the old ways. The institutions of the Medieval European Sociological Class System clung stubbornly to their positions; in spite of rapid advances in science and technology, such as the Printing Press.\n\nIn the center of town, we have the Great Cathedral of Notre Dame (\"Our Lady\" in English), which still is being constructed; although all of its lower sections are in full use. The central character of the story, a horribly misshapen from birth lad called \"Quasimodo\" (Charles Laughton) which is Latin for something like meaning \"Imitation of Real Life\".* Being a ward of the Church after suffering abandonment as a baby, the Hunchback of Notre Dame (which was the name that Quas was best known) earned his keep by being the official Bell Ringer. \"DUNG!\" The presence of a Band of Gypsies is made even more obvious and serious by the membership of one Gypsy Dancing Girl, the Beautiful Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara). It seems that the Gypsy Girl's charms have all of the Males of Official and Unofficial Paris wanting to get next to her. In the mix we find Gringoire, the Poet (Edmund O'Brien), Army Captain Phoebus (Alan Marshall), the Stoic, Frigid or Impotent King's Minister Frollo (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and even Quasimodo, himself. (You Devil, Quas!) When Phoebus is stabbed to death, someone tries to frame Esmeralda; but following a lengthy encounter with the French Legal System and torture, Esmeralda is sentenced to death, but is saved by the Hunchback; who swings in on a rope like Johnny Weissmuller in a Tarzan Movie, rescuing her on the stairway of Notre Dame.\n\nEventually, the Gypsy Girl's vindicated and runs off with Husband, Gringoire the Poet. All live happily eve after, sort of. As the story is closing, the last words on the screen are spoken by Quasimodo himself. While looking towards Heaven, the Hunchback, who is sitting among some gargoyles on the building's side, way high up above the street below, says aloud. \"Why was I not made of Stone like one of these!\" Sure is powerful stuff! Although the fine Hunchback make-up job is truly horrific, the character and the story comes across as sympathetic. We can ell remember when the film first was screened in our household, circa 1958-60, we had expected something more akin to the Universal Horror Classics. Instead of having that Horror-Shock-Thrill syndrome overwhelm us, we found that the film evoked tears and true empathy for a poor, unfortunate and inherently sad character. All of this is due to the outstanding job turned in by Mr. Charles Laughton; who made you feel for this poor, miserable, misshapen yet kind and good-hearted devil.\n\nThe support came by way of the fine company assembled; with names like: Harry Davenport, Walter Hampden, Katherine Alexander, George Zucco, Helene Whitney, Minna Gombell, George Tobias and Rod La Rocque. But special mention must be made of the performance of Thomas Mitchell as Clopin, King of Beggars. The energetic and highly talented Mr. Mitchell gave us a screen character which was forcible, credible, menacing, pivotal and yet still kind and brave to a fault when it came to his loyalty to the Parisian Street people in the era right after Columbus sailed the seas.\n\nSo, in closing all we can say is: \"GO TEAM, GO YOU FIGHTING IRISH!\" NOTE: * In this aspect, Quasimodo would appear to predate Superman's \"Bizarro\" by some 128 years.\n\nPOODLE SCHNITZ!!",

Victor Hugo is one of the most difficult writers to translate to celluloid. His books - masterpieces of literature by any standard - contain endless descriptive chapters, which have little or nothing to do with the story itself, but which cannot be skipped over. The first 100 pages, or so, of 'Les Miserables', for example, do not contribute to the story of the novel at all, which starts only thereafter.\n\nWhen, therefore, one gets down to filming a Hugo book, the most difficult task is to compress, within the limited cinematic time framework, the evocative \"atmosphere\" which Hugo builds through these seemingly unending descriptions, which are meant primarily to transport the reader, literally, to the scene of the events which are to take place.\n\nIn such a situation, it would be nearly fatal to tinker with the storyline of the book, as is done here. The result, unfortunately, is that the grand tragedy which is Victor Hugo's opus ends up becoming damply sentimental, despite the poignancy of Charles Laughton's closing line - \"Why was I not made of stone, like thee?\" It is delivered memorably by Laughton, and is a fitting climax to a noteworthy performance, but, for all that, it is a mutilation of Hugo.\n\nThere are, undoubtedly, great moments in the film, and all performers have performed above par. Maureen O'Hara, in her first film role, is all passion, and is the perfect foil to Laughton's dark Quasimodo. Yet, their relationship, which was the very essence of Hugo's masterpiece, remains, in the film, entirely, and sadly, undeveloped - Quasimodo, unfortunately, becomes, instead of the central character in the drama, a cocooned individual, who merely plays a peripheral part in the entire affair.\n\nUltimately, therefore, the tragedy of the film, despite the bravery of the effort in making it, is that it ends up, not as the story of Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but of Paris. As a period drama, and a study of Paris in those turbulent times, the film may score; as a sketch of Quasimodo and his turbulent relationship with the fiery Esmeralda, however, it fails.\n\nIf they had only stuck to Hugo's original story ...",

Plus, as we all know, the story is about Quasimodo, the bellringer of the Notre Dame Cathedral, a deformed man who never had any contact with the world outside and suffers with the horrible things people do to those who are different. Surprisingly, he doesn't talk much here, unlike in Disney's version (which he talks a lot and well).

There are similarities between this and Disney's version, but also many differences.\n\nMaureen O'Hara (who was 19 years old when this came out, as incredible as it may seem) is undeniably pretty and classy as Esmeralda. She doesn't look very gypsy-like, but that doesn't matter. I am surprised that she doesn't socialize more with Quasimodo and doesn't help him more, comparing to Disney's version. She is much kinder to him in that version. It's not that she isn't kind to him here, but aside the fact that she gives him water when he asks for it during the shocking torture scene, she seems so frightened of him that she ends up being somewhat cold towards him (even if unintentionally).\n\nThe goat is more cute and likable here than the annoying goat in Disney's version. I like goats. They're funny, cute and clever animals. There are no stupid talking gargoyles in this version.\n\nThis movie is, overall, okay but no great. However, it's got fantastic different angles of sight from the cathedral and on the cathedral. The climax gets considerably stronger by the end (by far the best part of this motion picture), with those battles (which include molten lead poured onto the villagers by Quasimodo through the gargoyles's mouths). Also, I've got to mention the powerful sound of the bells of the gorgeous Notre Dame Cathedral... it's so beautiful to hear, it even causes chills in a good way.\n\nIt's often difficult to understand what Quasimodo says, but his final line is one of the most sentimental: \u00abWhy was I not made of stone, like thee?\u00bb.",

                "text": "Hunchback of Notre Dame, The (1939) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nRKO's big budget remake of the 1923 Lon Chaney film has Charles Laughton taking over the role of Quasimodo, the deformed hunchback who falls the beautiful Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara) with tragic results. There's no question that this version is a lot better than the previous one but I still wouldn't call this a classic. There are many great things here but, as with the original, I found this version goes on and on and on and could have benefited from about ten or fifteen minutes being cut. I think the greatest thing about this film is its visual look ranging from the sets to the costumes to the beautiful cinematography. The amount of extras is what really stuck out for me this time as it was a grim reminder that an epic like this would never be done today due to budget concerns. The film has no problem getting the viewer in the mind frame that we're in the 1480s, which is a great achievement on itself. Laughton's make up is also very well done and ranks among the best out there from this era. His performance is just as good as he does a very good job at getting his torment across. I've always felt that O'Hara stole the film with her beauty, charm and incredible personality that jumps off the screen. Again, as much as I enjoy certain things in the film I can't help but think it should have been a whole lot better.",

                "text": "The Hunchback of Notre Dame is set in fifteenth century Paris shortly after the Hundred Year's War where superstition & prejudice are rampant. It is illegal for Gypsies to enter the city so Gypsy girl Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara) sneaks in & tries to impress King Louis XI (Harry Davenport) by dancing in front of him a bit, Esmeralda is exposed as a Gypsy by Count Frollo (Cedric Hardwicke) & seeks refuge in Notre Dame cathedral which is sanctuary from French law. After her lover is found dead Esmeralda is tried & convicted of murder & then sentenced to death by the hangman's noose. As she is about to be executed a disfigured bell-ringer named Quasimodo (Charles Laughton) saves her & hides her inside the cathedral once more but Esmeralda has divided French public opinion & there are many who want to see her executed & many who want to see her go free..\n\nDirected by the German William Dieterle this is often cited as the best adaptation of the classic novel by Victor Hugo, while undoubtedly a great film in it's own right I am not sure it would satisfy modern tastes in a way that a King Kong (1933) still would. The script by Sonya Levien from an adaptation by Bruno Frank is quite weighty & dealt with various issues I wasn't expecting. There are the obvious issues surrounding superstition & in particular racism as well as revolutions, the coming to the end of a societies era & there's even a little nod towards how much power the printed word & those who write it actually have. While this all makes for a very well thought out & watchable film I must admit I did find myself losing interest in the film on a number of occasions, I honestly don't think that should be taken as a criticism of the film in general as I think it was more down to my modern sensibilities & at almost two hours maybe a little impatience as well. I think The Hunchback of Notre Dame will be enjoyed most by those who are big fans of older films, I know that sounds an obvious thing to say but with it's classical acting & dialogue, fairly serious & sombre ideas that reflect history & real events I really do think those with a liking for old films will get the most out of it. I liked it & on a purely technical & conceptual level I really can't criticise The Hunchback of Notre Dame at all but, & it's a big but, it didn't really entertain me that much & I didn't really have any fun watching it & for me the whole purpose of watching a film is to be entertained & it's as simple & straight forward as that.\n\nDirector Dieterle does a wonderful job here & the film looks marvellous throughout. In particular the crowd scenes are fabulously choreographed & performed, it seems every single person in the crowd scenes know what they are doing & act as one. There's no lifeless standing around just to make up the numbers here, the actors in the crowd scenes certainly earned their money & as such you really believe that half of Paris is rioting. According to the IMDb The Hunchback of Notre Dame was the one & only film screened at the very first Cannes Film Festival after the rest of the festival was cancelled when Adolf Hitler's Nazi's invaded Poland during late 1939! Apparently Laughton's Quasimodo make-up took two & a half hours to apply each day & is very effective even though his droopy left eye never moves. Although originally shot in black and white a computer colourised version is available. This was the fifth filmed adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel with the Universal Pictures silent version staring Lon Chaney as Quasimodo being the most famous to that point.\n\nThe budget of about $1,800,000 this was a big budget film when it was made, hell there are films being made today with smaller budgets that this! Although set entirely in Paris it was shot in Los Angeles, apparently the Notre Dame replica set cost a cool $250,000 on it's own. The production design, sets, period detail & costumes are excellent. The acting is very good from a very good cast with Laughton in particular shining.\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame is a film which I can't really say is bad in any aspect, the sets, acting, script & story are great but there's just something about it that left me cold & detached. I can't quite put my finger on it & although I will happily admit that The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a better film on most levels I would rather watch something like Day of the Dead (1985). Maybe that says something about me though...",

After all, it has some dandy actors (such as Cederic Hardwicke, Henry Davenport, Edmond O'Brien, Thomas Mitchell, Laughton and Maureen O'Hara), nice costumes and lovely sets that must have cost a fortune. And, it's also a lot more watchable than the old silent version with Lon Chaney, Sr.--so I do recommend you watch it. However, I do have one reservation--it plays very fast and loose with the original story by Victor Hugo. In Hugo's version, the story is not a nice tale with a happy ending. No, pretty much everyone dies and it's a downer! But, only Hollywood would think to 'happify' it!! It's a shame, as the film had a lot going for it--including Charles Laughton's lovely performance as poor 'ol Quasimodo.\n\nOh, and the history teacher in me feels compelled to object to a statement early in the film that everyone thought the Earth was flat back in the 15th century. This is a myth--and people DID know that the planet was round. I could go on and on explaining it, but if you really care, do an internet search using the terms 'flat earth myth' and you'll see what I mean. They knew the Earth was round even in ancient times--and the folks in the Middle Ages and Renaissance weren't nearly as stupid as we'd like to imagine.",

For one thing it looks marvellous, the cinematography, editing, landscapes, scenery, make up and costumes are really immaculate. The music score also helps bring out the dramatic power, as do the spectacular crowd scenes and the chemistry between Quasimodo and Esmeralda. The acting is also exemplary; Charles Laughton is extraordinary as Quasimodo, grotesque on the outside, but like King Kong and Frankenstein he has subtlety and heart and he is quite a poignant character as well as grotesque. Laughton was so good here, I have occasionally known him to overact before(Jamaica Inn being a primary example), but he doesn't here, you do really do feel for Quasimodo. Maureen O'Hara is a sensual, beautiful and intoxicating Esmeralda, while Edmond O'Brien is suitably callow and youthful as Gringoire and Thomas Mitchell is marvellous as Clopin. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is also memorable as the tormented Claude Frollo, while his character isn't quite the complex character of the novel, Hardwicke the great actor he was still played him brilliantly. The only real problem I had with this film was that for me the ending didn't pack as much of an emotional punch as the one in the novel, which reduced me to tears when I first read it, and at 18 it still does. Quasimodo's rescue of Esmeralda, only Disney's comes close and maybe does it better, is incredibly powerful however as is the flogging scene. Overall though, a beautiful, powerful and touching film version of the amazing novel. If you get a chance to read the novel if you haven't already, do so, it is that good! 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

Charles Laughton portrays the disfigured 16th century bell-tower recluse of France who falls in love with the fiery gypsy Esmeralda; preconceived as a tour-de-force, Laughton's insistence upon disappearing inside Quasimodo's make-up and hunched back intrudes upon his acting (it becomes stunt-driven). The dialogue is pedagogic from the start, while the supporting characters are introduced to us in a rather condescending fashion. The imaginative, elaborate sets and the grand music score by Oscar-nominated Alfred Newman command respect--yet, with so little of interest happening in the foreground, one may become resentful of director William Dieterle's relentless heart-tugging and manipulation. ** from ****",

Hank Parker (the main star, played by Ray McDonald), the boyfriend of Al's sister, Betty (played by Bonita Granville), overhears talk that suggests the gang intends keeping its hooks into Al even after he reports in San Diego. Hank and friends 'Snap' Collins (Leo Gorcey) and Crawford 'Doc' Courtland (Charles Smith) decide to vacation in San Diego to get more information before reporting to the authorities. 'Doc''s girlfriend, Mildred (Dorothy Morris) tags along, and Betty shows up later. With the help of a local guy, Louie (Stanley Clements), the group follows the clues (including a dog with a damaged ear), snoops, and makes trouble. The bad spies in San Diego want Al to steal some secret equipment. How will it all play out? \n\nThis is a nice, fast paced show and makes for an enjoyable viewing. On the other hand, production values are low, although there are a few shots of marching Marines. There are no establishing shots or beach scenes that might make one feel in San Diego. Much of the plot relies on coincidence for making needed connections.\n\nAs was usual for the times, the language was occasionally slang-filled but clean and there was nothing overtly sexual. The only skin shot was of a snooping Ray McDonald getting a shirtless \"short wave\" treatment for chest congestion in the basement of a barber shop.\n\nThis film is worthy of being cleaned up and put onto a DVD.",

It still skips along nicely and is always entertaining. A Gentleman's Gentleman is gentle and humorous in tone, the music is rousing and ever enhancing the visuals and action and the animation consists of beautiful colours and fluid backgrounds.

Dismissed by most critics as a forgettable low-grade oater, \"Valley of the Sun\" was a high-budget class-A RKO production, and shows in the caliber of the witty screenplay, eye-catching production design, and shimmering black-and-white photography.

Lucille Ball displays a large amount of her comic abilities, both physical and character with some wonderful double takes. Even Dean Jagger, usually a very dour character indeed, has fun in VALLEY OF THE SUN. The story is slight, friend of the Indians tries to prevent the wedding of a girl he's met with the man who turns out to be the crooked Indian agent. More important than the actual plot are the progressive set pieces that evoke laughs and thrills. Billy Gilbert is a riot as the stuttering, sneezing (only one) judge; Cedric Hardwicke is an enigmatic immigrant; Antonio Moreno wears a false beak as the Indian chief; and western star Tom Tyler appears as Geronimo in a terrific scene where he challenges Craig. Seeing this movie puts the lie to all that hogwash that's been printed about Tyler having to play crippled Kharis in THE MUMMY'S HAND two years earlier because he himself was crippled with arthritis. Excellent musical score by Paul Sawtell is the icing on the cake.\n\nI highly recommend this spirited horse opera.",

That was a great racket in the old west and who's to complain as they don't have the right to vote as yet. Army scout James Craig cares however, but he's had to bust jail after helping a couple of falsely accused Apaches escape.\n\nIn making his escape Craig runs into both Lucy and Jagger and then has a dual mission to stop that wedding and get some justice for the Indians. Do you doubt he will succeed?\n\nThis western moves at a really nice clip with the comedy some of the rough house kind like Jagger having a stagecoach run over some cactus to dislodge Craig who is riding by hanging on to the boot. Nevermind though Craig pays him back good in stopping that wedding and I won't reveal how. \n\nGeorge Marshall was one of the great comic directors from the last century and never gets the due that he should. This minor picture for RKO shows him at his best.\n\nI remember back in the day in New York City when I was a kid, Valley Of The Sun was run frequently on WOR TV as they owned the entire RKO Library.

Ball's performance was OK - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (A typical funny line - \"there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!\") I didn't find the story all that compelling, although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent. There's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. As to Christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. If you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. If you're not big on the genre, this will be lacking. I'm not big on the genre. 3/10",

                "text": "I guess by the negative reviews here, movie viewers have not gotten any smarter in the 75 years since this film was released. Few people can appreciate and enjoy the brilliant sophistication of this film.\n\nFirst it is important to understand that censorship by the Hayes Office was at its worst in 1938. It wasn't strictly enforced before 1936 and relaxed a little bit during World World II. By the early 1950's European cinema was cracking open the Hollywood censorship open bit by bit. In 1937-38, it was perhaps at its strictest. The fact that Dorothy Parker and Tay Garnet was able to push such a sensuous and passionate movie past the Hayes Code censors is a tribute to their brilliance. Tay Garnet later directed the equally sensuous and passionate \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" in 1946.\n\nThink of the lead characters - the heroine is a murderer (even if she has her reasons) and the hero is a hard drinking, mercenary womanizer. The Hayes Code strictly forbade glamorizing such people and allowing them to go unpunished for their behavior. Yet Garnet, Parker and Alan Campbell are able to come up with characters and a plot that tie the Hayes code in knots. They are totally charming rogues.\n\nJoan Bennett and Fredric March are amazing in the leads -- witty, charming and sophisticated. Their sidekicks, Ann Southern and Ralph Bellamy are hilarious. The plot twists are still novel and unexpected after all these years.\n\nAs for the bad process photography that reviewers are complaining about, please understand that this is a comedy. The process photography was poorly done on purpose. The film was sarcastically commenting on the overuse of process shots in Hollywood by throwing in dozens of obviously fake process shots of Japan, China, Indochina, Singapore and more. The process shots are hilarious. Complaining about the process shots is like complaining that the sets and special effects in Austin Powers don't look as believable as the ones in James Bond.\n\nAfter watching this one, I'm ready to go out and party and drink a toast to Dorothy, Alan, Tay, Joan, Fredric, Ann and Ralph. Of all the screwball comedies of the 1930's, this is one of the most sophisticated and funniest. Don't miss it.",

When Kay says she wishes she could shoot him, he hands her a gun and she shoots. Then she starts running for her life. To change her appearance, she dyes her hair dark. This turned out to be a boon for Bennett, who took on an exciting new look with the dark hair.\n\nThe police send one of their own after her, Ben Blodgett (Ralph Bellamy) and one of their ex-own, the womanizing, slippery Sam Wye (March), now a detective who spends a lot of time coming on to women. He's also romancing his secretary Jean (Ann Sothern). He agrees to search for Kay and manages to get away from from Jean and hop a boat. He gets a line on Kay, and when Jean next appears, she's an assistant to Kay. Then Sam finds out there's a $100,000 award on Kay's head. Small problem - he falls madly in love with Kay.\n\nFun comedy that slows up in the middle, with good performances by a relaxed March, a very funny Sothern, a lovely Bennett, and Bellamy as an overblown police detective.

They shot miles of beautiful travelogue type footage and Garnett had it in his mind to use it. According to the Citadel Film Series book The Films of Fredric March, Garnett sold the idea to independent producer Walter Wanger. Who thereupon commissioned a story to be written around these films and naturally it would be starring his wife Joan Bennett. All that background you see in Trade Winds is what Garnett shot years earlier.\n\nTrade Winds is a strange film it can't quite make up its mind to be a mystery, comedy, or drama it truly defies classification. One thing we do know is that right away we're given information regarding the forensics that Joan Bennett is innocent. If she had not run, but stayed behind she'd have known right away and we'd have had no film.\n\nBut run she does and private detective Fredric March is put on her trail. He sure needs the money as well as he and secretary Ann Sothern owe a lot of bills. \n\nThe weakness of the plot is made up for a lot by the supporting performances of both Ann Sothern and Ralph Bellamy. Sothern is not in the tradition of private eye secretaries like Effie in The Maltese Falcon. She turns out to be just as good a gumshoe as March and she's a person of shifting loyalties.\n\nWhich is unlike Ralph Bellamy who might easily qualify for being the dumbest cop the movies ever portrayed. I could have seen him being commandant of the Police Academy forty years later. He's so earnest in such a Dudley Doo-Right manner he's positively hilarious. Sothern and Bellamy really do carry this film.\n\nMarch is a charming rascal and Bennett a beautiful and vulnerable victim, but if you watch Trade Winds I know you'll enjoy Sothern and Bellamy most of all.",

                "text": "\"Trade Winds\" has some enjoyable moments. This Tay Garnett-directed independent feature has the beautiful and talented Joan Bennett as a murderess on the run in the Orient pursued by a skirt-chasing former policeman played by a very miscast Fredric March. The film veers from whodunit, to travelogue, to screwball comedy, to romance, to courtroom drama without much consistency. Because the major emphasis is on comedy and romance, the film needs the versatility of a Fred MacMurray in the lead. Although a fine actor, March is out of his element in a role that requires a lighter touch. \n\nThe usually reliable Ralph Bellamy, who excelled as the proverbial light comic \"other man\" in classics like \"His Girl Friday,\" \"The Awful Truth,\" and \"Brother Orchid,\" ends up as an oafish buffoon of a policeman of the type often played by Edgar or Tom Kennedy. His performance clashes with March's and at times he seems out of an alternative universe. Although Ann Sothern has a very enjoyable drunk scene, she's underutilized, and the usually reliable Thomas Mitchell is given little to do but growl as a police commissioner... wasted in a role than would have usually gone to a William Frawley. \n\nThe film's inconsistencies are likely the fault of writer/director Tay Garnett, who had a lengthy but inconsistent career resume' with at least one masterpiece (\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\") to his credit. He did helm some films with similar elements to \"Trade Winds\": \"One Way Passage\" with Powell and Francis, \"Seven Sinners\" with Dietrich and Wayne, and \"China Seas\" with Gable and Harlow, but unfortunately Garnett never developed a consistent style, and by the 1950s he was directing TV Western series episodes like \"Death Valley Days\" and \"Bonanza\". With a steadier hand like a Howard Hawks at the helm, and more appropriate cast choices \"Trade Winds\" may have been a minor classic, but now it's just a curiosity. By the way, two interesting sidebars: Dorothy Parker (of Algonquin Round Table fame) was a collaborator on the script and the enigmatic Dorothy Comingore appears briefly here (under the name Linda Winters) several years before her triumph in \"Citizen Kane.\"",

But while March was a good actor in comedy (NOTHING SACRED and I MARRIED A WITCH show that) his \"Sam Wye\" is snowed under by his three co-stars, Bennett, Ann Southern, and Ralph Bellamy - in particular Ralph Bellamy for his performance as \"Ben Blodgett\" the assistant to March on this case. \n\nBennett made film history here for a film trick that was the reverse of her sister Constance's trick four years earlier in MOULIN ROUGE. There Connie had to play dual roles as Franchot Tone's wife (a brunette) and a French entertainer named \"Raquel\" (a blonde). For the part of the wife Connie had to have her natural blonde hair dyed black (but at the conclusion, supposedly wearing her film's natural color dyed \"blonde\", she is wearing her hair blonde. Here fellow blonde sister Joan (for reasons of the plot) changed her hair to black as a disguise. But the new hairstyle found favor with the public. Up to 1938 Constance Bennett was the better regarded (as a film star) of the two sisters. When the public saw Joan as a brunette she looked a bit like Hedy Lamarr, and got more attention. So Joan remained a film brunette for the rest of her career (including the series of great films directed by Fritz Lang like SCARLET STREET, and the films with Spencer Tracy FATHER OF THE BRIDE and FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND).\n\nTRADE WINDS is about a murder, and the leading suspect is Bennett. She flees and is crossing the Pacific with pal Southern. But they are being pursued by March, a detective who is known for his brains, his lack of ethics, and his chasing women. In a kind of twist to the plot strands in ONE WAY PASSAGE, March is determined to catch Bennett, but is falling for her. Soon he begins to wonder if he should let her escape. Bellamy (who for all his marvelous thick-headedness respects March's detective abilities) is appalled and starts working against him. Of course that is not much of a problem. Southern starts interfering with Bellamy and a second romance begins.\n\nSPOILER COMING UP:\n\nMarch does bring in Bennett, who faces trial and possible execution in California for the murder. While March re-evaluates the evidence to see if she really was responsible, she is visited in prison by Bellamy and Southern who try to comfort her. Bellamy is fine form saying, \"Don't worry Miss Kerrigan. In the entire history of California jurisprudence only five women have been executed. FIENDS IN HUMAN FORM MA'AM!!\" You can imagine how Bennett reacts to that comment (Southern trying to shut him up).\n\nBless the film gods for giving us Bellamy and his array of choice boobs!",

The film started with the footage Tay Garnett made during a round-the-world sail. Or at least as far as Bombay sail. What to do with this footage? Dorothy Parker and sometime husband Alan Campbell, and Frank Adams, an ex-reporter and music composer who co-wrote I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now concocted a story about a classy broad who thinks she shot and killed a man and escapes San Francisco by going west to Hawaii, Japan, China, etc. She is being chased by the World's Greatest Detective, the dumbest flatfoot on the force who never-the- less is high ranking, and said detectives secretary. So you see the background shots are used as the backgrounds of all the places they go. Miss Parker is responsible for some mighty clever lines, lines which gave Ann Southern a whole career.\n\nThis was produced by independent producer Walter Wanger who released through United Artists. Wanger could do what he wanted and obtained the services of Frederick March who had previously acted in a Parker script A Star Is Born for independent producer David Selznick. March's agent was David's brother Myron. Joan Bennett was married to Walter Wanger and perhaps the most famous or even important aspect of this film is that Joan went brunette in this film and never went back. As they say. Ralph Bellamy was stuck in the middle of a career where he would get scripts to read in which characters were described as \"Ralph Bellamy type\". His name in the film \"Blodgett\" was the same as the want to be star in A Star is Born. Getting failed \"B\" actress Ann Southern from nowhere was brilliant. No doubt the 4' 11\" Parker used the 5' 1\" Southern as an avatar for her whit, especially her smart-woman-in-a- man's-world be-bop. Blodgett is a direct rip off of Shakespeare's Dogberry from Much Ado About Nothing (which might be a title suitable for this film). Sidney Blackmer is featured and appears in one scene and is out of there faster than you can say Janet Leigh. Tommy Mitchell is in two scenes, both shot on the same set, and is also featured. Wanger padding out the cast for the price of two days work.\n\nThe ending is maddening. The murder is revealed to prove Bennett's innocence in the first ten minutes but the film just goes on as if nobody heard. Of course in those days people didn't worry about such things as extradition or jurisdictions so our detectives go off in pursuit. The put-upon secretary goes on after them. March and Bennett fall in love and Bennett is betrayed and sent to trial. A trap is set for the real murderer based on the idea that they will be the people who don't show up at a party. Only they do show up at the party or else there wouldn't be a climax. The thing is the murderer, the backstory, the motive or even who these people are is never explained. I guess its not really important as the story skims along purely on the surface, sort of like the drama skims in front the back projections from Garnett's journey. Everybody, that is movie goers, knew the context of film conventions. They could connect the dots. At one point March buys a ticket from a cabin on a departing ship under the name Mr. & Mrs. Jones and Bellamy and Southern are tricked into taking it. So they decide to get married. A Dorothy Parker joke. \n\nThe sets are by Alexander Toluboff and a young Alexander Golitzen and the cinematography by the matchless Rudolph Mat\u00e9. Garnett never made a stupid film or directed a bad scene so Wanger did his job correctly and hired the best people for his film.\n\nI guess today the film from the journey is more valuable than the negative and rights to Trade Winds. It shows a world which no longer exists and that is priceless.",

He's aided by two bumblers (Sothern & Bellamy), at the same time he falls for his attractive quarry.\n\nNot quite a sophisticated comedy, not quite a picaresque chase, not quite a murder mystery- - all add up to a not very good movie. Hard to believe this is from glossy MGM since the production values are nearly incompetent. In fact, I've seen better process shots from a Lash LaRue oater, and since these make up half the movie, you've got to wonder where quality control was.\n\nI'm assuming acerbic wit Dorothy Parker and husband Alan Campbell were hired to furnish sophisticated banter for the two couples. If so, I must have missed it. What I did hear were subtle grammar gaffes from Sothern (e.g. 'whom for 'who') and clever malaprops (e.g. 'deduct' for 'deduce') from Bellamy, intended, I guess, to show their humorous pretensions, but hardly crowd-pleasers.\n\nAlso, it looks like Bellamy's buffoonish cop amounts to a typical example of 30's cops when Hollywood treated them as low-comedy relief. And whose idea was it to tack on the last 10-minutes of whodunit that sort of sticks out like a glued on appendage.\n\nWhere the movie does work is with the lovely Bennett and the comedically gifted Sothern. Still, it's a bit puzzling why the movie didn't turn out better given the talent involved, including ace producer Walter Wanger. Maybe it has to do with as many as four writers and who knows how many re-writes or with director Garnett's inability to forge a unifying style. But, whatever the reason, the film remains a somewhat unlikely disappointment.",

Anyhow, the movie was so-so, Ann Sothern, my favorite, had the usual barbs.

                "text": "If you hate process shots, you may not want to see \"Trade Winds\" which uses more of them than perhaps any other dramatic film of its time, as it follows a young murderess (Joan Bennett) from Honolulu to Tokyo to Shanghai to Indochina to Ceylon to India as she flees the law. But if you love Joan, her loveliness of form, face and manner compensate for a great deal. And you get to see her as both a blonde and a brunette. Although she is billed in huge letters above Fredric March and Ralph Bellamy, I'd say March, as a womanizing detective who pursues her, has more screen time in one of his lesser roles. He's not bad, just not exciting. Ralph Bellamy is saddled with an overwritten comical supporting role as an eager-beaver detective, and tries very hard to make his repetitious and predictable actions funny. Ann Sothern handles her wisecracks as snappily as ever as March's secretary, and has some effective drunk scenes, but also seems forced. At its heart, this is a deeply romantic story about love conquering all but it also has elements of screwball comedy (the supporting players), suspense (the crime, the chase, the climax), travelogue (endless process shots of the Orient as backdrops for less-than-thrilling dramatic scenes with the principals). Despite some snappy moments (particularly in the first third), ever-shifting locations, a generally brisk pace and a powerhouse writing trio which includes Dorothy Parker, the story loses its grip.",

The owner's name is Bruhm with an umlaut and sounds absolutely nothing like \"William Randolph Hearst.\" Nevertheless, the murder puts the San Francisco Police Department in a tizzy.\n\nThe detective assigned to the case is the near-sighted and totally square Ralph Bellamy whose theories of the crime have the virtue of being consistently wrong. Bellamy doesn't drink, smoke, swear, or wear anything but neat tweeds and a boater. The police chief, Thomas Mitchell, having little confidence in Bellamy, also hires a private detective to work with him. The private detective is the suave Frederick March. It's always nice to see March in a white suit and pith helmet when he visits exotic places.\n\nThe pair of detectives, dogged by March's secretary, Ann Sothern, track Bennett all over Asia -- from Hawaii when it was still \"T.H.\", to Japan, to Shanghai, to Singapore, and finally Bombay. In each place, March pursues his quarry by getting to know the local belles, while Bellamy huffs and blows his cheeks with indignation. The sets are all in the studio but the rear projections are sometimes interesting. That Shanghai street manages to really look like the street that runs along the waterfront.\n\nThey catch up with Bennett somewhere along the way, but she's changed her hair color and Bellamy has no idea who she is, while March not only recognizes her but falls instantly in love with her, and the other way round. The romance is boring but the picaresque story has its slight charms.\n\nGee, this was shot in 1937 and Japan is still full of geisha girls. And Shanghai is not yet desolate. And Singapore is full of white guys in white suits, kind of running things.\n\nFrederick March was always an underrated actor but I thought he was better in dramatic roles. Bennett -- well, I don't know where she picked up those faux English phones -- \"I cahn't do it\" -- when she was born just across the Hudson from New York.\n\nDorothy Comingore is buried somewhere in the cast. A few years later she was to make another movie about the death of an important newspaperman, in which she played Wife Number Two, Mrs. Charles Foster Kane.\n\nDorothy Parker is listed among the writers but she must have done it for the paycheck, or during off moments while visiting Robert Benchley in Los Angeles, because the script has few genuine tag lines and no acid or sophistication. Well, the dialog does give Ann Sothern a couple of hyperlearnedisms. \"Whom is she?\" I take it that getting drunk isn't a sign of sophistication.

Let me count the ways: First, the first third of the film (after the murder) -- where they are trying to establish Frederick March as a playboy detective -- is about the worst waste of celluloid in the history of the American cinema. It makes him -- and women -- look like fools.\n\nSecond, okay, so Joan Bennett went from blond to brunette. If that's the most notable thing about this film it tells you a lot about how bad this film really is.\n\nThird, Ralph Bellamy's part is so dumb. I'd blame the big studio for forcing such a dumb part on him, but this was an independent film. A shame, because as we all know, Bellamy was a fine actor.\n\nAs st-shot points out, this film includes \"some of the worst back projection in film history\"...and what's more, that makes up a good half of the film.\n\nFrankly, when the cobra shows up, I was hoping it would somehow put an end to March and Bennett, and that we -- the faithful viewers -- would be put out of our misery.\n\nNow, in all fairness, this movie isn't all bad. The love scenes between March and Bennett are actually pretty decent. And Ann Southern is very pleasant on screen, although I'm not sure that her presence is at all logical. The last third of the film is decent and has an interesting plot twist, although how the right people show up at a party is rather bewildering; I guess it made sense to the screenwriters...too bad it was so confusing to the audience (as several of our reviewers have noted it).\n\nIt would be easy to excuse this poor film by noting that it was made way back in 1938. But that's just a year before \"Gone With The Wind\" and \"The Wizard Of Oz\" and half a dozen other notable masterpieces. I give this one an \"D\". Don't waster your time.",

Then the murderer (spoiler!!) is instantly plugged in a version of Dodge City justice. And no blood spills on the rugs!

                "summary": "A Good Bob Hope Comedy",
                "text": "This film was done when Hope was at or near the peak of both his film popularity and his comic abilities. Based on a Booth Tarkington novella, which had served Rudolph Valentino with mixed results in 1924 (he acted well, but the part labeled him as gay with certain male critics), the story is how Hope is the barber at Versailles to King Louis XV (Reginald Owen), gets into serious hot water with the King and Queen (Constance Collier) and is forced to flee the palace disguised as the Duc de Chandre (Patrick Knowles). Owen has sent Knowles to Spain to get rid of him (he's a rival for Madame de Pompadour - Hillary Brooke), and to have him marry the daughter of the King of Spain (Marjorie Reynolds, who is daughter to Howard Freeman). But Knowles is a target for an assassination by minions of the head of the Spanish Army (Don Francisco - Joseph Schildkraut). So Knowles and his associate (Cecil Kellaway) let Hope masquerade as Knowles. Knowles, in the meantime, is looking for the delightful looking woman he met on the way to Spain - he does not realize it is Reynolds. And Hope keeps crossing paths with his old girlfriend, Mimi (Joan Caulfield), who is furious at him for getting her banished from France accidentally.\n\nIn 1946 Hope was between 44 and 42 years old, so physically he still looked reasonably presentable as a man (when properly made up with make-up) who is in his 30s. That helps considerably. Compare this film to it's Technicolor counterpart in the middle 1950s, CASANOVA'S BIG NIGHT. In that film the plot is very similar, but the middle aged man, with the middle aged spread is not believable as even a comic substitute for the great lover. He is just plausible in BEAUCAIRE. He also demonstrates his timing is sharper, and he even demonstrates (possibly accidentally, but one wonders) a gift for mimicry. At one point he is speaking when behind a mask as though he is Owen, and he momentarily does capture something of the speech pattern and bluster of the English actor.\n\nAs pure escapism the film is more than adequate. As history it is questionable. Schildkraut is a type of Spanish Napoleon, wanting to overthrow the royal family in a war between Spain and France. Hence the need for the royal marriage that involves Knowles and Reynolds. But the military in Spain in the 18th Century produced no such figure as Don Fernando (it is hard to believe the screen writers Norman Panama and Melvin Frank were thinking of a later adventurer and court favorite Count Godoy). Owen is quite good at being Louis (he had played the role a decade earlier in the George Arliss film VOLTAIRE). The year is never giver - actually it is quite vague, but 1765 seems the most probable year: At one point Collier and Owen are reminiscing about their wedding. Queen Marie (the daughter of the King of Poland) married Louis in 1725, and Owen mentions they've been married 40 years). The Queen died in 1768, and Louis died in 1774. The problem is that the Spanish King is Philip II in the cast. King Philip II of Spain ruled from 1555 - 1598. The King of Spain in 1765 was Carlos III (notable for a number of reforms, and being reluctantly drawn into policies by the French). You see, the Bourbon Family had begun ruling Spain in 1714, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, when King Louis XIV's second oldest son became King Philip V of Spain (the Philip they screenwriters were probably thinking of). But the so-called \"Family Compact\" united the foreign policies of Spain and France for most of the 18th Century. So the threat of a war between the two countries never really existed in history at this time.\n\nThere are many nice touches in the film: Hope's attempt at suicide (with an unknotted hangman's noose) that is almost pushed to completion by his friend Leonid Kinski; Hope's mimicry of Owen (mentioned above); the climactic duel between Hope and Schildkraut, in which both men get entangled with a harp and a cello. Caulfield and Knowles both get a chance to sing. And Hope even (with Schildkraut's assistance) gets a passing shot (literally) at his rival/friend from the \"Road\" Pictures. It remains an entertaining spoof, and one of Hope's best comedies.",

                "text": "A \"costume comedy\" of the sort occasionally essayed by Bob Hope, this \"version\" of the Booth Tarkington novel is meant as a pastiche of the 1924 Rudolph Valentino film, but the one-liner master extraordinaire and his favourite scriptors, Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, can not resist going their own way, and a comically winning tangent it is. Splendidly directed by George Marshall, with top-flight cinematography and editing by Lionel Lindon and Arthur Schmidt, respectively, the action unfolds in the royal courts of 18th century France and Spain, nations on the verge of war. As the barber for King Louis XV (Reginald Owen), Beaucaire (Hope) finds himself in a situation where he must impersonate a nobleman, the Duc Le Chandre, or lose his head, whereas in the Tarkington original his impersonation is clearly of his own choosing. Meantime, in Madrid, conniving Don Francisco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish army, desires to prevent the upcoming marriage of the actual Le Chandre (Patric Knowles) with Spanish Princess Maria (Margaret Lindsay), by assassination if necessary, in order to destabilize the crown, leading to armed hostilities between the neighbouring countries and an opportunity for him to organize a coup. The false Duke, Beaucaire, becomes the prospective victim of this homicidal chicanery and we view him at his wedding ceremony where desperate measures must be taken to avoid being captured and then killed in quick succession. Hope's gags are beyond counting, some of them quite funny and all featuring his perfect timing, and a scene at the Spanish court that satirizes the use of the lorgnette by the nobility is classic, while there is pulchritude galore with three excellent actresses: Joan Caulfield as Beaucaire's true love Mimi, Hillary Brooke as Mme. Pompadour, and the lovely Lindsay, given her first role since Paramount picked up her contract. Also to be commended for their sharp performances in this fast-moving frolic are the swashbuckling Knowles, Schildkraut, Owen, Cecil Kellaway and Constance Collier, while Hope is supported for the first time by songs from Ray Evans and Jay Livingston, contributors to 11 subsequent films by the comedian, whose work here was Woody Allen's inspiration for the latter's LOVE AND DEATH.",

                "text": "Some current film fans with a perfunctory knowledge of cinema stars of the past will be shocked to learn that Rudolph Valentino and Bob Hope played the same title role in two different versions of Booth Tarkington's Monsieur Beaucaire. Of course you can believe there's a vast difference in the version.\n\nThe Valentino version is a straight dramatic part about a Parisian barber in the court of Louis XV pretending to be a nobleman. Rudy was at his most romantic in the role and it was one of his biggest hits in the Twenties.\n\nBob Hope's Monsieur Beaucaire finds Bob as a barber at Versailles in the court of Louis XV and worried about the romantic intentions of his sweetheart, scullery maid Joan Caulfield. Cole Porter wrote it best that Caulfield is true to Hope in her fashion, but she's an ambitious girl who knows what it takes to get ahead in the court. She aspires to be Madame Pompadour who is played here by Hillary Brooke.\n\nDue to a set of circumstances way too complex to write about, Hope and Caulfield both get themselves banished, mainly because of Hope's fantasies and both get themselves involved in the politics between France and Spain where a royal marriage is being arranged to the dismay of both participants, Marjorie Reynolds for the Spanish and Patric Knowles for the French.\n\nPlaying the puppet-master in all the intrigue is Joseph Schildkraut who shows a real flair for comedy. His final duel with Hope ranks right up there with one Hope engaged in with Basil Rathbone in Cassanova's Big Night. \n\nRounding out a wonderful cast of supporting players are Howard Freeman as the King of Spain and Reginald Owen and Constance Collier as the King and Queen of France. You don't doubt why Louis has Madame Pompadour around when you take one look at the Queen. \n\nBy the way Joseph Schildkraut comes to one of the most satisfying ends a villain ever got in film. You'll have to see Monsieur Beaucaire and laugh all the way through to see what happens.",

Here the lines he delivers are actually as hilarious as his delivery.\n\nHe actually does some quite decent acting in this one. The character of the barber Beaucaire is more romantic and less cynical than the comedian Hope.\n\nHope has surrounded himself with some of the most talented people in Hollywood. Cinematographer Lionel Lindon was nominated three times for an Oscar and won once with \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" Film Editor Arthur P. Schmidt was nominated twice (for \"Sayonara\" and \"Sunset Blvd.\") Composer Robert Dolan was nominated 8 times between 1942 and 1947. Sadly, he never won. He should have been nominated for this movie, but he was already nominated for \"Blue Skys\" in 1946. Art Director, Hans Dreier, was nominated 20 times and won 4 Oscars. He should have been nominated for this movie, but he already had two other nominations in 1946. Set Decorator, Sam Comer was nominated 22 times and also won 4 Oscars. Male Costume Designer Giles Steele got 4 nominations and won twice. Mary Kay Dobson. who did the exquisite gowns in this film, was never nominated, but she should have won an Oscar for the fantastic four foot wide hooped skirts the women wear.\n\nHope was never nominated for an Oscar, but this is the one movie where I think his performance merited consideration.\n\nJoan Caulfield, in only her second film, is dazzling. As Mimi, Beaucaire's love interest, she is hilarious and has excellent chemistry with Hope. The same year, she played the love interest of both Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby in \"Blue Skys\". Everybody else in the cast is just delightful.\n\nThe funniest scene is when Beaucaire meets the King of Spain. Beaucaire is pretending to be an aristocrat. He is told to act \"distainful\" When they meet, Beaucaire and the King just glare at each other through lorngettes (opera glasses).\n\nSecond funniest is when Beaucaire gets exposed as a barber and slapped. The king tells him to slap the fellow back. \"Everybody is entitled to his opinion,\" answers Hope meekly, \"Why if I had a sword...\" A lackey offers his sword to Hope, who quickly pushes him away, saying, \"Mind your own business.\" If you're in the mood for a wonderful and sweet old romantic comedy, put across by some of the most talented people in the golden age of Hollywood, don't miss it.",

Fun scene near the beginning where Beaucaire helps to hide Madam Pompadour, while pretending to give the Duke a shave. I was never a fan of period pieces, and if this weren't a Hope project, I probably would have turned it off. Mimi is sent off to Spain, and the real Duke, and Beaucaire dressed as the Duke end up there a well. Some fun recognizable faces in here... Cecil Kellaway, Reginald Owen, and Constance Collier for supporting cast. The musical numbers were completely un-necessary, and should have been eliminated. It's a grand adventure, with more meat on the bones that most of Hope's quick little comedies. The sword fight at the end goes on way too long. This one is okay. Not Hope's best.

Seems lengthy at 93 minutes, with a few peaks and valleys in the plotting, and yet it's relaxed and pleasant enough to be palatable to even non-Hope buffs. Still, ace screenwriters Melvin Frank and Norman Panama don't know when to quit, and even the funny tag at the end is ultimately spoiled by unnecessary silliness. A couple of nice songs by Ray Evans and Jay Livingston, a good production, and a funny duel (with Hope's ski-slope nose getting caught in the harp strings) make for a fitfully amusing time. ** from ****",

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the films are a bit more plot-driven than many comedies and in general these films have held up much better than his later films (particularly those from the 1960s). However, I noticed one reviewer gave this one a 10 and suggested Hope should have received Oscar consideration for this film....yeah, right. They're not THAT good! \n\nThe film finds Bob playing a barber in the latter portion of Louis XV's reign (about 1770 more or less). Naturally Bob is a bit of a screw up and gets in trouble. But, there is a way out--he has to agree to pose as the Duke--a man who is to marry the Spanish princess and solidify an alliance between the countries. But, no one realizes that a crazy Spanish general (Joseph Schildkraut) has plans to kill the Duke, as he WANTS the countries at war with each other! So, it's up to the cowardly Hope to try to save his butt and, hopefully, find love. As for the Duke (Patric Knowles), he's fallen in love with a woman and doesn't really want to marry a princess he's never met. Can it all work out in the end and everyone live happily ever after? \n\nThe movie is relatively low on laughs--particularly the climactic sword-fighting scene (it's rather lame). But, Hope is an agreeable personality in the film and that makes up for the problems...which would include the3 fact that NONE of the French or Spanish people looked or talked like they came from these countries. Heck, Schildkraut was Austrian and sounded NOTHING like a Spaniard! And Hope seemed about as French as Nelson Mandella! Still, a nice and agreeable little film.\n\nBy the way, the original \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" was a silent film starring Rudolph Valentino and was not a comedy. Also, although this is only of interest to history teachers, the film talked about the guillotine several times, though it was not used for the first time until about 1791--during the French Revolution.",

And yet, with their meticulously crafted backgrounds, Fleischer pictures had a unique beauty of their own. I love both the Fleischer and Disney creations from the 1930s, but given the choice of either, I'd take the Fleischer creations in a heartbeat.\n\nAll this installment lacks is the far-better voices of Gus Wickie as Bluto and Mae Questal as Olive, but Max lost both when he moved his studio to Florida.

Olive Oyl, washing dishes inside, gets a telegram that she passes to the boys that says in essence to stop fighting and act more civilized as signed by the Popeye Fan Club. So they do while getting some food service that results in the three of them trying to balance various food and drinks literally on their hands! They then try to make conversation about conversing and language. Eventually, it ends with a gradual slapstick scene that ends with them all singing, \"It's the Natural Thing to Do!\"...Hilarious from beginning to end, it's a shame that perhaps because of the black-and-white imagery, this and other Fleischer cartoons have not been seen by many of the public in nearly 30 years. Perhaps this will be rectified when Warners finally releases a Popeye collection later this year.

Second, for the most part, when you've seen one, you've seen them all, as the same basic plot was recycled again and again.

So, Popeye, Bluto and Olive decide to be sophisticated and they try so hard--and fail so miserably! It's quite clever and worth a look--even if you hate Popeye.",

Charley knew how to perform this sort of comedy. The gag construction is impeccable and the execution decent, but this season of Chase at Columbia was not as strong as it had been the previous year.

While they were generally enjoyable, they weren't up to the quality level of his older films he made with the Hal Roach Studio and sometimes these newer shorts seemed to use a lot of old gags. This is definitely the case with \"The Awful Goof\". While it's not a bad film at all, one comedy idea was lifted directly from the Oscar-winning Laurel & Hardy short \"The Music Box\".\n\nThe film begins with Charley trying to get to the church for his wedding. But, after a series of disasters, he ends up having an accident in which he gets a lady on the street covered in water. So, he tries to take her back to her place so she can change her clothes--but is discovered by his fianc\u00e9 and her husband who slugs him. During the course of the film, again and again, Charley ends up bumping into the same husband and wife--and the husband is ready to kill him by the time the film ends. One time, the husband pretty much recreates Billy Gilbert's reaction when Laurel & Hardy brought a player piano to his home--and he proceeds to destroy it! \n\nOverall, mildly enjoyable but not exactly original or among Chase's better efforts.

Evelyn Keys was very young at the age of 27 and had not too long ago completed her appearance in \"Gone With The Wind\" 1939, where is gave an outstanding performance.

Still, the comedic undertone of the movie is pretty effective, thanks mainly to Demarest, Joslyn, and especially the perky Keyes. The mystery itself is not very involving since the suspects get little screen time or character development. It's just sort of a hat rack to hang the various hijinks on.\n\nThe world's slowest elevator is a funny little touch along with its Spanish-American War operator. And for old movie buffs there's a brief appearance by cult figure Ann Savage (Erika), known mainly for her savage role in the cheapo classic Detour (1945).

Some, like \"Dangerous Blondes\" aren't exactly feature or B-films because their budgets are just a hair better than a B and because they are much longer than the usual B (which usually clock in at about 60 minutes). But, the film is clearly not a prestige picture, as it features mostly second-tier actors and no big-name actors at all. The closest to this are its stars Eveyln Keyes (who made a few big films) and Allyn Joslyn (a guy who always seemed to play excellent cranky supporting actors).\n\nThis movie is much like a Thin Man film, but instead of rich Nick and Nora Charles, you've got the Craigs. Barry Craig is a crime fiction writer and he and his wife Jane prefer solving crimes to writing about them. As for the time in this film, it's far less important than the banter between them. It's filled with humor and I noticed MANY times my wife was laughing along with the film. My usually very picky wife declared that the film was kinda fun--a glowing endorsement, believe me! The dialog is the star, though Keyes and Joslyn sure did their best to make the film a lot of fun...if murder can be fun! Worth seeing and a shame they didn't make more of these films.\n\nBy the way, during the radio show, Mr. Craig identified a 'revolver'. Well, I am not an expert on guns, but it clearly was a semi-automatic, not a revolver.

Mr. Hawks is responsible for discovering Lauren Bacall, a young model from New York with no experience in the cinema. Well, Mr. Hawk's instinct paid handsomely as Lauren Bacall went to have a fabulous career of her own.\n\nThis film is interesting as well, for it marked the beginning of the romance between Mr. Bogart and Ms. Bacall. Their love is there in front of the viewers to see. This movie shows us a Bogey with a heart. He was an actor that excelled in this type of picture and under Mr. Hawks's direction, his Capt. Morgan makes a remarkable impression.\n\nThe story has all the right ingredients to keep us interested in what is going on with all these characters in Martinique. World War II makes a detour and comes to the island.\n\nThe cast for this movie is first rate. Humphrey Bogart is a tough Capt. Morgan who falls head over heels for young and lovely \"Slim\" Browning, a mysterious young woman who loves adventure. Ms. Bacall has a way to sing a song that makes it unique because of her sense of style. Both these stars smolder the screen in their love scenes.\n\nWalter Brennan plays Eddie, the drunken sailor that helps Morgan take tourists on fishing junkets. Marcel Dalio, is Frenchy, the owner of the local hotel; he is the one responsible for putting Morgan in touch with the partisans operating in the island. Dolores Moran and Walter Szurovy are the De Bursac, who are smuggled into the island by Morgan, at his own risk; they are sought by the local branch of the Gestapo.\n\nHoagy Carmichael, the great musician puts an appearance as Cricket, a pianist that entertains at the hotel lounge. The three musical numbers are done flawlessly. Mr. Carmichael's rendition of \"Hong Kong blues\" stays in one's mind forever. Also we hear two other of his songs, \"Am I blue?\", and a sultry rendition by Lauren Bacall of his hit, \"How little we know\". Hearing sung by Bacall makes any other interpretation superfluous.\n\nThis is a film to see to enjoy great acting under the magnificent direction of Howard Hawks.",

However, Brenenan is neither here; he''s simply fun to watch and someone you can't help but like. I think he was one of the more underrated actors of his time.\n\nThe story had a good blend of intrigue, action, suspense, comedy, beautiful women, great characters and great dialog.

The comparisons to \"Casablanca\" are numerous and fans of Humphrey Bogart will have no trouble picking them out one by one. Bogey's character Harry Morgan is once again an expatriate on foreign soil, though here he has no trouble calling himself an American. The Peter Lorre part is handled by Marcel Dalio as hotel owner Frenchy, while the Sydney Greenstreet presence is given to Dan Seymour, the smarmy Gestapo captain. Add the smoldering presence of Lauren Bacall in her screen debut, and you have the ingredients for an adventure film that almost plays out stronger in each of it's mini chapters than in the sum of it's parts. That's OK though, because each tableaux presents us with rich characterization and a sense that we know who these players are and what they're up to.\n\nAs most fans know, the legendary Bogey/Bacall team up began here, so I won't dwell on that. What's worth mentioning though is Bacall's brazen confidence in carrying out her role in what looks like a casting call mismatch. Only a teenager at the time of filming, she looks to be about thirty, with dialog that belies her years. Though her scenes with Bogart are electric even to this day, it's worth noting her chemistry with Dolores Moran near the end of the film. The times \"Slim\" and Mrs. de Bursac appear together, their subliminal clash over \"Steve\" fairly screams \"meow\". That's why it's all the more comical when Bogey's character begins his operation on Paul, \"Slim\" uses a leaf fan to waft chloroform fumes in the direction of the fainted madame - outrageous!\n\nMy first introduction to Walter Brennan was his famous TV role as Grandpa McCoy in \"The Real McCoys\" series of the late 1950's. Here, with a hitch in his giddyup, Brennan sports an early tryout for that television role, but with a reliance on alcohol. He's fairly philosophical about it though - \"Drinkin' don't bother my memory, if it did I wouldn't drink. You see, I'd forget how good it was, then where'd I be, start drinkin' water again\". The best exchange between Eddie (Brennan) and Harry takes place on board the fishing boat as Harry explains the kind of danger they might be in. It's a masterful dialog that brings Eddie to sobriety real quick.\n\nThe film's sinister side is revealed when Vichy authorities intend to disrupt any activity that might prove detrimental to German interests. As the Free French resistance look for a suitable base to continue their opposition on the island of Martinique, Captain Renard (Seymour) warns Morgan and company - \"We are only interested in those persons who have broken the rules laid down for their behavior\". Morgan is busy breaking the rules all over the place, and gets right down to the frightening business at hand by roughing up Renard and his bunch when it appears his time on the island is growing short. Here, letters of transit are known as harbor passes, in another nod to Bogey's better known film.\n\nToday's viewing of the film was my third, and as mentioned earlier, it gets better each time. It helps that Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor, but that begs the question, did Bogey make the films, or did the films make the actor. As in \"Casablanca\", \"The Maltese Falcon, \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and \"The Big Sleep\", the events and characters come together to create an unforgettable story. And if for no other reason, no matter how many times you watch \"To Have and Have Not\", it's always worth watching right to the very end, even if just to catch Lauren Bacall's sweet sashay to the strains of Hoagy Carmichael's piano.",

Turns out to have been a personal milestone for the both of them as well.\n\nI was watching my VHS copy of To Have and Have Not today and included was the movie trailer and in it Warner Brothers announced it was introducing two exciting new screen personalities, Lauren Bacall and Dolores Moran. Ms. Moran was pretty enough and gave a nice performance as the wife of the resistance leader, but some careers take off and some don't. Didn't hurt Lauren that she married her leading man either.\n\nThe location of our story is Martinique right after the fall of France in 1940. As a French colonial possession Martinique fell into the hands of the Vichy collaborationist government. They didn't get free of them until 1943, months after the Germans occupied all of France in November of 1942. \n\nHumphrey Bogart is an expatriate American along the lines of his Richard Blaine character in Casablanca. He doesn't own a swank nightclub, he's just got a charter fishing boat that lives on and runs with an alcoholic pal, Walter Brennan. But like in Casablanca, a shooting in a nightclub of his client Walter Sande gets him involved with the local Vichy police and the politics of the island. \n\nIt also gets him involved with Lauren Bacall who's just looking for a way to get back to the USA. She's not above a little light fingered action to help herself, but all that does is get her introduced to Bogey. And their sizzling scenes made cinematic history.\n\nTo Have and Have Not is fortunate to have the presence of Hoagy Carmichael one of the greatest musical talents America ever produced. He plays Cricket, the club piano player and he sings and plays Hong Kong Blues one of his greatest songs. Hoagy also wrote for this film, How Little We Know, which Bacall sings for her supper. \n\nDan Seymour and Sheldon Leonard play a couple of especially smarmy Vichy police officials. They have the upper hand until the very end when tables get turned rather suddenly. The only two film I've ever seen something turn that quickly is John Ford's Wagonmaster and the Richard Widmark police drama, Madigan. You can only push Bogey just so far.\n\nEven in revivals today when Lauren Bacall tells Bogey all he need do is whistle and she'll come running, the whistles of affection will go up in theater.

                "text": "\nMost film fans know the famous bet made between Ernest Hemingway and legendary director Howard Hawks (SCARFACE, BRINGING UP BABY).  Hawks claimed he could make a good film out of Hemingway's worst novel.  He does and Hemingway hopefully paid up.  The great author must have forgot the star power Hawks had in access to in Bogart and Walter Brennan because that is exactly what drives the film.  They are backed by the writing of William Faulkner and the direction of Hawks, who is always able to have his actors deliver slick lines quickly and effectively to have the story run smoothly. Oh yeah, an actress named Betty Bacall makes her debut opposite these screen legends and makes what I consider the most auspicious debuts of any actress from the 1940's.  She meshes well with Bogie, trading quips and matching her future hubby line for line.  The real star of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is Howard Hawks, a director who could create comedy, suspense, and art amidst a rather dull story.\n\nI never read Hemingway's novel, so I couldn't tell you whether it was his worst.  I believe Hemingway made the gesture and Hawks showed him up. Notice touches of the previous year's all-time classic CASABLANCA (this time the owner of the foreign booze bar is the roulette manager from CASABLANCA). World War II is a backdrop, Bogie is a cynic with that heart of gold, and he helps his \"rummy\" buddy, played by Walter Brennan.  Bogie helped the low-life likes of Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet in 'Blanca and in this one, his scenes with Brennan are comic relief.  Brennan plays a funny drunk who is prone to spilling his guts after a few rums.  Bogie's \"Harry Morgan\" rents his boat to rich Americans for fishing and will lend a hand towards the French war effort with his sailing skills much like his power to give the infamous \"letters of transport\" to Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. Similarities aside, there is an original piece of work to see in this well-paced semi-thriller, with Bogie, Bacall, and Hawks to send them sailing into cinematic history.\n\n\"Just put your lips together and blow,\" will live in filmgoer's minds forever, as will the fact that Bogart and Bacall practically fall in love right in front of our eyes.  A problem I had with the film was the annoying interference of the copycat (CASABLANCA) French police.  Sorry, no Claude Rains to add some spice to it.  I understand the movie contrasts starkly with the novel, depicting the characters at an earlier age.  It is predictable and you know which girl is Bogart's.  It is entertaining to see Walter Brennan squirm and tick as a hopeless alcoholic who can't seem to remember a conversation that took place 5 minutes prior.  True, Hawks has no official writing credit, but the film has that Hawks touch because of the humor and genuine quality the main characters present.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is a picture to sit back and watch as brash, Hollywood filmmaking of the 1940's and a nice piece of classic Hawks who moved onto THE BIG SLEEP with Bogart and Bacall soon after.  Its good but not the best of Hawks or Bogart.\n\n\nRATING: 7 OF 10",

I don't know who won or how much the bet was for, but my money is on Hawks.\n\nSet on the island of Martinique, Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" stars Humphrey Bogart as a suave fisherman who rents his boat and services to anyone with money. Alongside him is Lauren Bacall's Marie Browning, a weary traveller who falls in love with him. They call each other by nicknames - she's \"Slim\" and he's \"Steve\" - but there's no mush between them. Their romantic scenes mostly consist of witty dialogue, written by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman, but played like a chess match. Consider a scene in which Bacall kisses Bogey. Bogey asks what the verdict is, she tells him she dosn't know yet and goes in for another. \n\nWalter Brennan, in one of his greatest roles, plays the rummy Eddie, who thinks he takes care of Bogie when in reality it's the other way around. The movie never questions their relationship. Clearly Eddie is an alcoholic, and a pain in the butt, but Bogey's loyalty to him is unfaltering. We thus know that when Bogey is eventually asked to help the French resistance, he can't say no, despite his barbed dialogue and tough-guy facade. \n\nSome scholars will tell you that Hawks' films are about male bonding, but they're about bonding, period. And notice that Bacall's character bonding with Bogey is more central to the story than even Bogey and Brennan. Of course such strong female characters are typical in Hawks' films. Consider Rita Hayworth in \"Only Angels Have Wings\", Bacall again in \"The Big Sleep\" and Ann Sheridan in \"I Was a Male War Bride\". \n\nBut of all these women, Bacall makes the biggest impression. She was discovered by Hawks' wife from a magazine photo, and she fell into cinema with great ease, with her gruff voice, strong face, and soft eyes. She never had another role as good as this one.\n\nHawks was, above all, a storyteller. His eye for characters, actors, locations, music, timing, pace, and for cutting out the boring crap, was impeccable. Take one particular moment of intensity in which Bogey shoots one of the bad guys from a gun concealed in a desk drawer. He then pulls out the gun and aims it at the remaining thugs. After a moment, he realises his hand is shaking. \"Look at that,\" he says to the bad guys. \"Isn't that silly?\" He shifts the gun to his other, steadier hand. \"That's how close you came.\" \n\n\"To Have and Have Not\" offers some good adventure, romance (both on and off screen), and is a great example of a particular type of writing. The only positive that big-brother \"Casablanca\" has over it - both films essentially tell the same tale of war-time responsibility - is in its use of space. Rick's bar (in Casablanca) is chartered by Michael Curtiz's camera in such a way that it almost becomes a place you'd like to visit, or feel you already have. It's a three dimensional space, and we're given a tour of every nook and cranny.\n\nIn contrast, Hawks is a two dimensional director. He is unable to flesh out the bars and \"Casablanca\" inspired Hotel in which his film largely takes place. We get great lighting, great compositions, but it's all flat. We don't feel like this is a tangible, real space. Hawks' command of mood, editing, lighting and music almost makes up for this, but not quite.\n\n8.9/10 - Underrated.",

                "text": "In To Have and Have Not, director Howard Hawks, as usual, uses a set of relationships to explore moral values. Here, the relationships are between Humphrey Bogart as a deep-sea fishing boat captain in Vichy-controlled Martinique, who is approached by the Free French for help in their resistance, Walter Brennan, as Bogart's alcoholic sidekick, and Lauren Bacall as a femme fatale working her way from port to port: what's explored is the moral paradox that in order to keep your independence, you have to accept responsibility for others. These relationships develop in an almost musical pattern.\n\nFew critics seem to have noticed the delicacy and depth with which the Bogart/Brennan relationship is portrayed: Brennan's response to being slapped by Bogart -- \"I wouldn't do that to you...\" is very moving and a great moment in cinema, as is Brennan's subsequent realization \"I know why you done it: you didn't want me to come because you was afraid I'd get hurt! I'm all right now...\" \n\nThe more you think about this film, the more moral complexity and depth you can see in it, since Hawks makes his most important points indirectly, by collocation. Take the early scene with Bogart's rich client Johnson, who loses a trophy fish and expensive fishing tackle, obviously through his own incompetence and arrogance (he refuses to take Bogart's and Horatio's advice.) Later, Johnson tries to cheat Bogart out of the very considerable sum of money he owes him. There's a moral lesson here: the man who is \"not good enough\" (that fundamental Hawksian value) physically is also not good enough morally. This doesn't mean you have to be physically strong or tough to be good (more on this below,) it means that being good enough means being able to handle yourself properly both in the physical and the moral realm: \"good\" is the same in both.\n\nBut there is more to it than that, as two more debts come into play. Later, Bogart removes some money from Johnson's wallet in partial payment of the debt just after Johnson is killed. With this act a second \"level\" of the morality of indebtedness is identified: a good man is permitted to bend the law when he's sure it's morally correct (though it's significant that Bogart immediately has the money taken away from him by the authorities, perhaps teaching us that if we're going to act superior to the law, even if we are justified in the moral realm, we still have to pay the real world price.) The indebtedness theme is further developed in a third restatement (again musical terminology comes to mind) where Mama offers to cancel Bogart and Bacall's large hotel bills if he'll agree to treat the wounded resistance fighter they are harboring. Bogart, who had previously refused to do so, now accepts the job but says they'll still owe the bills. Here a third level of the validity of debt is identified: Bogart has learned that if you are going to do something because it is right, then you had better do it because it is right, not for some other reason. He has grown in stature and reached a higher level of existential awareness: he acts rightly not for money, but because he wants to prove to himself that he is the sort of person who acts rightly, and taking money for the act would be a refutation of that claim.\n\nThe Johnson scene also launches another theme subsequently developed in the same almost musical manner: do you have to be tough and strong to be good enough both in the physical and the moral realms? At first it might seem the answer is yes: Bogart is tough and strong and good enough; Johnson is weak and soft and not good enough. But we see there's more to it than that as we follow Bogart's relationships with Brennan and the resistance fighter. Brennan is a lame alcoholic who is terrified at the prospect of gunfire, but he manages to do what's necessary when it comes. And the resistance fighter is by his own admission not physically courageous -- his skittishness nearly spoils the mission and gets him wounded -- and yet he's committed to the stunningly audacious goal of getting a fellow resistance leader off of Devil's Island. He's afraid, but as Bogart tells his wife, \"He didn't invent it.\" The lesson, again taught by indirection and collocation but taught clearly, is that not being tough and strong doesn't mean you can't be good enough, it just means you have two more obstacles to overcome in order to get there.\n\nMuch more could be said about the film's interlacing moral themes, but the above may be enough to open up the issue, which is all that can be done in a short notice.\n\nFor the rest: Very loosely based on what Hawks and Hemingway reportedly agreed was Hemingway's worst novel, the film also features Hoagy Carmichael as a saloon pianist, and introduced his song \"Baltimore Oriole,\" which becomes a sort of sound track Leitmotif, though it's never actually sung in the film. Little attention has been paid to Hawks' use of music: it's very significant when and how the song is played in the background, and though you never hear the lyrics, if you happen to know them, they add much to the atmosphere. To have and Have Not has also been called the only movie associated with two Nobel Prize winners (William Faulkner, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Hemingway.) Despite what some film books say, Lauren Bacall did her own singing: the legend that it was a teen-aged Andy Williams was denied by Hawks himself.\n\nFinally, lest I be accused of turning this into an art film, To Have and Have Not is a hugely entertaining movie with great lines, terrific atmosphere and a serious undercurrent, and should be recommended for all.",

This, combined with his attraction to fellow American \"Slim\" Browning forces Harry to re-evaluate his \"out for himself\" values.\n\nAlthough the continued success of this film owes a lot to the pairing of Bogart and Bacall, there is enough going for the rest of the film to make it stand up down the years. The plot is very interesting in Hawks look at a man who tries to take a distanced approach to the problem of others before standing up to be counted; I don't know enough about the period to really know what context he was putting this forward in but it is still interesting enough and does make the character of Steve/Harry a lot more complex.

One-armed guys can be good heroes or villains, but not heroes who lose.\n\nThe story is that Howard Hawks and Hemingway were having drinks and that Hawks claimed he could take even Hemingway's lousiest novel and make a successful movie out of it. They agreed that \"To Have And Have Not\" was about the lousiest and the bet was made. Evidently Furthman threw the contents of the novel out of the window except for the general Caribbean setting, Harry Morgan's occupation as skipper, and the names of some of the characters.\n\nIt's doubtful that Hawks truly enjoyed himself during the shooting. He had a habit of hiring delicious young women for his movies and then, well, then bonding with them. In this case, he had his eye on Bacall, who was 18 years old, but she bonded with Bogart instead. Hawks also had a habit of avoiding actors who stole his women and punishing the women too, so it was Bogart's next-to-last film with Hawks. It wasn't the first time. In Kirk Douglas's movie with Hawks, the actor stole Elizabeth Threatt, a major masochist, who came like water and like the wind she went. And it was good-bye to both John Ireland and Joanne Dru after \"Red River.\" Poor Hawks.\n\nThe writers, which evidently included Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, built up a story that sizzled with sexuality at the time of its release but seems like of loose-limbed, gangly, and amusing today. (The oft-parodied scene in which Bacall tells Bogart how to whistle -- \"You just put your lips together -- and blow.\") Hawks had an affinity for boy's adventure book values. You know, a man rediscovers his pride or sobriety and overcomes his demons and whatnot. It's pretty lowbrow stuff unless you want to get into conjectural homoerotic themes. But Hawks had a solid sense of humor too. He had a tendency to rework scenes so that they had gag lines in them or amusing bits of business. This one has its funny moments too, as well as a bit of action.\n\nNone of it is either gripping or believable but it's fun to watch. Bogart and Bacall really hit it off on screen. Her movements are so languorous. She hunches over a bit when she walks, like some tall women do. And her voice -- it's down there in the subwoofer range. At the end, when she and Bogie and Walter Brennan walk out of the bar, Hoagy Carmichael plays a lively little tune and Bacall does a sort of shimmy that must have sent shivers up the male spines of 1944.\n\nWhile I think of it, I'll give an example of what I meant by \"amusing bits of business.\" The scene -- a French patriot must have a bullet extracted from his shoulder by Bogart. Several people stand around watching tensely. As Bogart probes the bullet hole, another beautiful woman, who Bacall is jealous of, faints to the floor. Bacall is administering ether from a spray can and Bogart tells her to fan the fumes away from the bed or they'll all be out. When Bacall notices that no one is watching her, she hastily fans the gas down towards the body of her unconscious rival. It isn't much, just a second or two, but it adds to our understanding of what's going on and is meanly funny.\n\nNot Hawks' best but enjoyable viewing.",

Sorry, but in my view, Hawks lost the wager. No doubt he had access to a great cast. Humphrey Bogart played the lead character of Harry Morgan - a fishing boat captain on the French island of Martinique during World War II who gets caught up in helping the French Resistance. The cast also featured Walter Brennan as his rummy sidekick Eddie, and this was Lauren Bacall's film debut as Morgan's love interest Slim. Even Hoagy Carmichael appears as the piano playing Cricket. So, the cast is great; the story unfortunately less so.\n\nTo me, it came across as a weak successor to the previous year's classic \"Casablanca.\" In that classic, Bogie dealt with the challenge of helping the French Resistance and dealing with the Vichy authorities in North Africa. The idea is the same here, with the action transferred to the French West Indies. But the story takes a very long time in developing - it takes about an hour before we really know what's happening. That opening hour deals largely with Morgan's business relationship with Mr. Johnson, who rented his boat for fishing - which really had little to do with the story as it finally developed, and - admittedly just my opinion - Lauren Bacall is not the world's greatest singer! Where \"Casablanca\" provided an interesting study of the dilemma of French officials who had to choose between Vichy or de Gaulle, there was none of that here. The Vichy officials portrayed seem to have no hesitations or second thoughts about serving Vichy. In the end, everything seemed to fall together far too easily. There was no great build-up of suspense; neither was there any release of tension as it ended. It's certainly worth watching for fans of Bogie and Bacall, but in all honesty it's not a great movie.",

Even the writer William Faulkner is in on recasting (and making almost invisible) Ernest Hemingway's novel.\n\nBut this says \"Casablanca\" all over it, from the opening shot of a map on. Then throw in Humphrey Bogart and a Sidney Greenstreet wannabe, have an engaging piano player at the center of the popular nightclub, and set it in an exotic part of the French Empire where the war is raging but you can hardly tell. Director Howard Hawks seems to be winking all the way to the box office and no one else seems to know it.\n\nNot that people aren't trying hard. Certainly the romance has gone from some archetypal, dreamy impossibility (with Ingrid Bergman in \"Casablanca\") to a very earthy and valid (and real) romance with Lauren Bacall. That's actually a big reason this movie has such fame, because the Bogart/Bacall chemistry is right there for us to watch, and I mean the people, not the characters. Another reason is Walter Brennan, who is so odd and so convincing at the same time you have to wonder. I think Hoagy Carmichael has to be appreciated, too, more than he usually is. He has a major secondary role, and is in the movie more than almost anyone, playing the piano in all kinds of moods...and really playing it, and singing, too (along with Bacall, a little).\n\nBut all this stuff never actually gels the way it should. It's almost like it knows it's imitative and so it doesn't try for actual high stakes drama or romance. If you think otherwise, give \"Casablanca\" another look, and besides much better screen writing, and much better photography, you'll see some basic emotional wires attached that are only superficial here--the War itself, for one thing, and patriotism, and love lost (rather than just love found), and sacrifice of all kinds. And some character actors to beat the band--there is no one here to match Peter Lorre, or Sidney Greenstreet.\n\nThese are fair comparisons because Hawks invites them. But since it is all knowing, does that make this a commercial one-off, the director and his buddy Bogart winking, at least, at each other? Maybe. Or maybe it's the first dip into an irony about movies, and about the reality and artificiality that goes with that, that is deliberate and yet can't show its hand too clearly because the audience is frankly not as jaded and cold as the people making the movies. It's a really fun movie, but it'll keep you on the surfaces, and if you want depth, don't be disappointed.",

It's a decent film but in going so out of its way to be like Casablanca in every respect this film can't help but suffer in comparison. All the elements of Casablanca are here but all those elements worked better in the earlier film.\n\nThis time rather than Morocco we're in Martinique. Bogart plays fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan. Before the client to whom Harry's been renting his boat can pay him complications ensue. And now Harry is mixed up in something he wants nothing to do with. Meanwhile a pretty young woman shows up and you just know she's going to complicate things further. Harry quite begrudgingly agrees to help the resistance fighters with their cockamamie plans. And meanwhile he falls in love with the young woman. Much of the film takes place in a nightclub with a piano player warbling away because, well because that's how they did it in Casablanca. Much as the Bogart-Bergman interactions made Casablanca spark to life here it is the chemistry between Bogart and young Lauren Bacall which perks things up. They make for a great couple but the movie which surrounds them lets them down somewhat. The story is just not all that interesting. So similar to Casablanca yet for whatever reason the story here just doesn't grab you the way it did back then. No romantic rival for Bogart here along the lines of the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca, that removes some tension this film could have dearly used. Could have used someone to fill a Claude Rains kind of role too. This movie is so focused in on Bogart and Bacall. This famous couple does a fine job but they could've used a little help.

And another one after a passionate kiss when a gal tells a guy that it's even better when he helps. Duh! But I like what happens after yet another passionate smooch between Bogie and Bacall. She pulls away and says to him, \"You need a shave,\" after which she immediately love-slaps his unshaven face. It's her way of telling him without words that she's attracted to him and she really doesn't give a good hoot whether he shaves or not.\n\nBy now, just about everyone knows that this movie is all about \"Steve\" (Humphrey Bogart) and \"Slim\" (Lauren Bacall). In their first movie together, the two exhibit an explosive chemistry rarely seen from any other actor-actress combo. As one watches the movie, with the great Howard Hawks putting the two thru their various paces, one simultaneously imagines the two of them falling in love offscreen -- which they did! -- just as they do in this movie. For more on this, I highly recommend Lauren's autobiography -- \"By Myself.\" In that book, she talks about the two of them sneaking around to see each other like a couple of teenagers -- which she was! As I recall, Bogie was still married at the time -- though estranged from Mayo Methot.\n\nAs for \"T H a H N,\" there are many other fine elements that make it well worth one's time. A pretty good storyline revolving around the Free French contesting the Vichy French (Nazi collaborators) in Martinique during the early days of World War II. A strong supporting cast much reminiscent of the one in \"Casablanca.\" Great dialogue by novelist William Faulkner and Jules Furthman. Also, a strong musical score (\"Am I Blue?\" -- \"How Little We Know\" -- \"Hong Kong Blues\") by Hoagy Carmichael with a strong assist from Johnny Mercer.\n\nIn a very good Humphrey Bogart movie, which this certainly is, one would never suspect that a young ingenue actress, with little training or experience, could scene-steal from a polished veteran like Bogie. And I won't say that she does such in this movie. I do know that she did not want to and was not trying to (her autobiography). The fact is, however, that it took a star actor of Bogie's magnitude to keep Betty from dominating the screen with her earthy sex appeal and pure luminescence. Her sashay out of the bar in the last scene here is enough to make any man weak in the knees. No wonder Bogie tumbled! Both onscreen and off!\n\nSo ..... tell me, now .....

Most of the plot and details from that book were jettisoned. The final script has Humphrey Bogart playing a business owner in a Vichy-controlled French colony who is drawn into political intrigue despite the fact that he normally avoids such involvement.\n\nBogart's Steve is a libertarian at heart. He believes in a \"live and let live\" approach to life. Don't bother him--or his friends, or those who are unable to defend themselves--and he will not bother you. His sidekick is Eddie, a \"rummy\" who depends on Steve. Eddie (Walter Brennan) is a liability because he talks too much, but he is more than a dependent; he is \"family\". Steve runs his charter fishing service and Eddie drinks the beer.\n\nAs the internal politics heat up in Martinique, Steve largely avoids being affected, though the increase in regulations are beginning to chafe. What motivates him to step outside his carefully maintained neutrality is a woman.

The lighting is a large part of this atmosphere. The music also plays a significant role, with Hoagy Carmichael's piano playing alternating between jazzy, sultry and tropical.

They might have been popular at the time, but now they are gems. And other times there's just a joy in the general style and feeling of those times -- the great jazz musicians, the lingo, the styles, all of that -- which makes movies from the 30s and 40s really special because they show off the fantastic popular culture of the time, a culture that I sometimes feel is more tasteful and intelligent than what you see in today's movies. Howard Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" is the best of both of those. Imagine you're in some kind of exotic bar in the middle of nowhere, and Hoagy Carmichael is the in- house pianist. Don't worry about what to say, because William Faulkner is writing the dialog. What universe are we in? \n\nFamously, this was Lauren Bacall's first movie, and the movie as such testifies to the kind of rapport that Hawks could create with his leading ladies. He was truly a \"star-maker\" if anybody was. Bacall proved a major talent throughout her career but was rarely, if ever, as exciting as she was here. I love how she and Bogart toss things back and forth between them (matches, keys, then matches again), a perfect visual metaphor for the relationship. Bogart's in top form here, his character is even more ruthless than Rick in \"Casablanca\" prior to the formulaic turnaround that he undergoes. I like some of the elements Hawks, Furthman and Faulkner added to the mix here (I'm excusing Mr. Hemmingway from the mix because my understanding is that his book was followed only in the vaguest sense), like the jealousy in the second half where the rebel guy's wife (Dolores Moran) is saying stuff to him like \"I don't think I'll be bothered by anything you ever say again.\" The script is very excellent in this film, one of the best in movie history I would even argue. It's amusing and exciting on so many levels, you can watch it in so many different states of mind. It's a continuous cat and mouse game, and then you also have these fascinating relationships like Bogart's character Steve's friendship with Walter Brennan's Eddie. Eddie is similar to the Dean Martin character in \"Rio Bravo\", he's dissipated and Steve wants to help him prove to himself that he is still a man. Brennan is a brilliant actor, every scene feels spontaneous with him. You also have people like Marcel Dalio and Dan Seymour, just these very professional and high quality actors, and of course as mentioned the legendary composer and personality Hoagy Carmichael on the keys. I just have to admit that in our household Hoagy Carmichael is basically a deity so I have no objectivity about him, but that said he's incredible in this movie. He's the mid-westerner in all of us reaching for something exotic and far away, singin' the \"Hong Kong Blues.\" It's also interesting how while he's sort of similar to Dooley Wilson in \"Casablanca\", he's more of a friend or mentor to Bacall's character while Bograt has his relationship with Brennan. It gives a lot of independence to Bacall and Carmichael, there's a real feeling that they might possibly get cut loose from the other duo at any moment. Bacall makes sure to say good-bye to \"Cricket\" before leaving the scene at the end.\n\nThe thing about this movie that strikes me most of all, is the way that emotion prevails over logic at every turn, both inside the movie and in the actual composition or structure of the movie. The audience really wants Bogart and Bacall to get together because we're so excited by their play, their back and forth. They give as good as they take. They feel like glorious shadows to me, they're bigger than actual people and more well defined. Sex, writ large. Maybe censorship makes things less \"realistic\" in an objective sense. What Hawks did here with Faulkner and Furthman, both master writers, was to create a style of dialog that was more realistic than reality if you follow my meaning. Like dream dialogue, and more real to us in the same way that dreams are more real or true than waking life.\n\nOnly a few trifles drag the film down slightly... the obligatory hero-martyr figures are played up a bit too heavy and don't have the substance of their equivalents in \"Casablanca\", the obvious model for this film. The benefit of losing that weight is greater freedom for the Bacall character in general because she's disassociated with the melodrama in a way that Bergman isn't in the other film, but the scenes with the rebels and the discussion of \"the Germans\" feel like they are painted with a very broad stroke. The film in general is very broad and could be criticized along those lines although as I think you can gather, I feel that would be missing the point. This is a great film despite whatever of those things you might argue are flaws, because it features a male and female protagonist who go through a very convincing form of courtship through this film, a courtship that defies the obvious even while it fulfills the intimate needs of the audience. This film was a model for many films in its wake. Bogart is able to maintain his hard boiled image because Hawks has created a woman who is convincingly modern to accompany him on his dark voyage.",

                "text": "Exiled in Vichy-occupied French territory, Bogart is an American whose only sympathies are minding his own business. Yet he accepts to help a French Resistance agent and his wife, officially for money.. but we understand he's good at being noble. Rich in witty dialogs and featuring a colorful supporting cast including Marcel Dalio, Dan Seymour and a sympathetic pianist, it's one of the greatest love stories ever BUT it's not \"Casablanca\": we're in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Bogart is Harry Morgan, a fishing-boat Captain, Dalio is the hotel owner, at the piano, it's Cricket, not Sam and no love triangle but a real romance, real underlined.\n\nThis is Howard Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" adapted by Prize-Nobel winner William Faulkner from a novel written by no-less Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway, and despite that pedigree, whether you call it a rip-off, a remake or a coincidence, there's nothing that the film 'has' and its glorious predecessor 'has not'\u0085 except for one element, one thing it'll always have, the sensual, dazzling and irreplaceable Lauren Bacall. And after her recent passing, movies like \"To Have and Have Not\" are important to show how naturally born for gracing the silver screen, at the precocious age of 20 (looking 25), she was. Bacall had the stuff legends are made on.\n\n\"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca\" established Humphrey Bogart's stardom with his trademark macho persona: a lone ranger, cynical yet not dishonest, strong yet not invulnerable\u0085 in the heart-department anyway. And while it's Bacall who asks him for a match all through the film, she's the first actress to ignite a burning \u0096and inextinguishable- fire of desire in his heart, ironically, he's the one who found his match. According to Hawks, a woman tailor-made for Bogie had to be as insolent and indomitable as him. Bacall, covering her nervously shaking hand under her armpit, with a cigarette and a sensual gaze and sharp lines delivered with that unique husky voice, invented the perfect attitude that would conquer the hardened heart of good old Bogie.\n\n\"Who was that girl... who left you with such a high opinion on women\", about kissing him, \"I've been wondering if I'd like it\" Naturally, she needed another kiss to make up her mind. Bacall leads the show, while Bogart reacts and hesitates but she resists his attempts of feigning reluctance. Her feelings implode with her signature line \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow\", to understand this metaphor so delightfully enrobed of sexual innuendo, remember what she says before \"You don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle.\"\n\nIn other words, don't put an act, just show, like she says \"I'm hard to get, all you need to do is ask\". No mystery here, the whistle is the core of a relationship that would end with Bacall putting a whistle in Bogart's coffin. That whistle that started it all, not Cupid and his arrow, but two nicknames, 'me Steve, you Slim' for enduring romances are always cemented by complicity. Bogart, a Last Century man, was married, straight-laced in infidelity matters and was twice the age of Bacall, but what Bacall had, his wife had not, and \"To Have and to Have Not\"'s merit is to showcase the growth of a real romance, it's not Slim and Steve but Bogie and Baby, and again, it shows in the film.\n\nAs critic Leonard Maltin said, actors used to play characters loving each other, but this might be the first time where actors don't have to act, and the more restrained they are according to their 'attitudes', the more obvious the love is. And what a delight to see love in live. Indeed, there are moments in the film, where Bacall looks like a gal having the time of her life, look at her when she's waving the fumes of chloroforms away clearly in the direction of her passed out rival, Dolores De Moran, with that 'ain't I a stinker?' Bugs Bunny look, Actually, Moran's Ilsa-like role had to be shortened because she couldn't possibly rival with Bacall, no one would believe it.\n\nDe Moran ended up having an affair with Hawks, who envied Bogart for taking Baby away. It still cost Bogie his marriage but what a small price to pay for legend. As for the film, it's liable to be seen as a B-version of \"Casablanca\", adapted from what Hawks considered Hemingway's worst (a story originally set in Cuba but changed for political reasons and to fit the context of the war), but if there's no Claude Rains, there's the greatest character actor Walter Brennan who steals the show as Eddie, the brave rummy sidekick who, asking either for money for a drink, or if \"you was ever been hit by a dead bee\". is the second highlight of the film far behind Bacall, whose chemistry with Bogie redeemed every minor flaw.\n\nAs Howard Hawks said, a good movie should 'have' three good scenes and 'have not' a bad one. Let's start the count, no bad scene, the 'whistle' line followed by Bogart's practice and his genuine smile, that other defining moment when in the darkness of a hotel room, he realizes Slim's insecurity, leans over her, gently lifts her chin, and kisses her, as we witness the genesis of a real love story. And there's that ending when Cricket asks Slim if she's happy, her off-character little hip dance perfectly captures that mix of glamor and naughty innocence, Bogart grabs her like saying 'stop fooling around, kid, you're mine, now'. Indeed, she'd never leave that arm, not with that gorgeous smile, of an enamored 20-year old girl\u0085 and Brennan handing the bags follows them, concluding the film with the perfect little pirouette.\n\nShe's happy, we're happy... and they lived happily ever after.",

But be that as it may, the film is best remembered for the coupling of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who quickly took their on screen romance out into the real world. The rest as they say is history.\n\nThe story is set in the Caribbean city of Fort de France, Martinique, shortly after the fall of France to the Germans. Harry 'Steve' Morgan (Bogart) is a world wise fishing boat captain who is wanted to do a secretive people smuggle from a nearby island for the French Resistance. Initially very reluctant, Harry has to take on the job when a series of events leave him flat broke. Also into his life comes Marie 'Slim' Browning (Bacall), an American pickpocket who has come to the island more by default than design. So with his alcoholic pal in tow {Walter Brennan} and the Gestapo breathing down his neck, Harry has a whole heap of issues suddenly making his once neutral and tranquil life explosive.\n\nLegend has it that Hemingway & Hawks were involved in a debate one day during one of their fishing trips in Florida. The out-shot of that argument was that Hawks proclaimed he could make a winner of a movie out of what he considered was Hemingway's worst novel, To Have & Have Not. Hawks duly delivered this hugely endearing, often funny and entertaining movie that is a lesson in on screen chemistry and finely tuned writing {Jules Furthman and William Faulkner}. The similarities to Casablanca are many, so in that, this is weak by comparison. In fact dig away the buzzing like atmosphere here and you find a pretty weak plot. But in its purest escapist form the film is a triumph. Savvy, sexy and not short on suspense, To Have And Have Not holds up to its classic status. 8/10",

For those who forget their history, the French caved in to the Nazi's with hardly a fight. Although not everyone agreed with dividing France into the North and Paris being dominated by Hitler, the south, and its colonies remained in French control, known as the short lived Vichy government. The problem with this movie is that the sentiment of the time dates the movie. The only bad guys are pro-Vichy and terribly stereotypical. The good guys are anti-Vichy and terribly stereotypical. Bogart plays the same sort of character that he played in Casablanca. He comes across as a non-partisan American who is trying to just get along on the outskirts of the War. His anti-Nazi hatreds conflict with his personal goal to look out for himself. Of course without Bacall we viewers are lead to believe that he risks his boat and life to get her out of Martinque. For political and personal reasons, Bogart saves the anti-Nazi leader and his wife (maybe better looking than Bacall). He also pulls his alcoholic side kick played by Watler Brennan out of the hands of the Vichy police, and all ends well with the threesome leaving the island.

He doesn't want to get involved in any conflict though; he just wants to get on with his life\u0085 he flat out refuses to help when members of the resistance try to employ him. All that changes though when his wealthy American client is killed before he can pay him and the police confiscate his money and his passport. Around this time he also meets another American; Marie 'Slim' Browning; a part time lounge singer and part time pickpocket who he wants to help leave the island; she however wants to stay with him. When he eventually takes the job for the resistance he has the somewhat unwelcome assistance of his friend Eddie; a man who isn't happy unless he is having a drink and thus potentially unreliable.\n\nThis film is inevitably going to be compared to 'Casablanca' given that it stars Humphrey Bogart as a reluctant American in French territory during the war who gradually is forced to take sides. This is unfortunate as it inevitably suffers in comparison; 'Casablanca' is of course one of the greatest films ever made. If you can put that aside though this is rather enjoyable; Bogart is great as Capt. Morgan and Lauren Bacall does a fine job, in her first role, as Slim. Given her chemistry with Bogart it is no wonder they went on to star in more films together. Walter Brennan is good as Eddie; managing to make what could have been a clich\u00e9 drunk a sympathetic character. The story itself is fairly routine but it is well told and there are some decent enough action scenes as well as a degree of tension. After quite a bit of tension the ending seemed a little anticlimactic; almost as if the last few minutes were missing\u0085 we see the bad guys defeated and the heroes walking away but it felt like we should have at least got to see them sailing away on the boat. That is a minor complaint, and perhaps just a matter of taste, overall I found this to be enjoyable and I'm sure any fan of Bogart or Bacall will like it too.",

                "text": "The film director Howard Hawks was a close friend of the writer Ernest Hemingway and, in general, was an admirer of his works. He did not, however, have a high regard for Hemingway's novel \"To Have and Have Not\", and told the author so. This led to a bet between the two men that Hawks could not make a good film of the novel. This film was the outcome. \n\nThe film is nominally based on the\u00a0novel, but the plot has been altered virtually beyond recognition, although it does keep the main character, fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan. The film is, in fact, an unacknowledged remake of \"Casablanca\", with which it shares the following features:-\n\nA wartime setting in 1940 or 1941 \n\nA setting in a French colony under the\u00a0Vichy regime \n\nA world-weary American hero, played in both cases by Humphrey Bogart, who is initially cynical about the war but who later changes his mind and throws in his lot with the\u00a0French Resistance\n\nA glamorous blonde (here Lauren Bacall rather than Ingrid Bergman) to act as the hero's love-interest. \n\nScenes set in a bar with a jazz band and a pianist, here played by Hoagy Carmichael. (Carmichael was, of course, best known as a musician, but he did occasionally act in movies, generally playing a musician). \n\nA French Chief of Police, named Renault in \"Casablanca\" and Renard\u00a0here. The name \"Renard\" may have been deliberately chosen because of its similarity to \"Renault\", although as \"renard\" is French for \"fox\" it may also be a reference to his cunning. \n\nA gallant Resistance leader with a beautiful young wife. \n\nHemingway's book was set in Cuba and the Florida Keys, but here the setting is changed to Martinique in the summer of 1940, shortly after the\u00a0fall of France. Morgan, who runs a business catering for big-game fishermen, is\u00a0approached by\u00a0the Resistance for assistance in smuggling two of their members onto the island. He agrees,\u00a0but only because he has been promised\u00a0payment and\u00a0is short of money, although later, of course, he becomes an enthusiastic supporter of the Free French cause. He also finds time to conduct a romance with an American girl named Marie Browning. Morgan generally calls Marie \"Slim\", a reference to Hawks's model wife Nancy who was also known by this nickname; she, for some reason, always calls him \"Steve\", although everyone else calls him by his real name, Harry. \n\nThere are a few differences between this story and that of \"Casablanca\". Renault was a morally ambiguous character who eventually emerges as one of the \"good guys\"; here Renard is a straightforward villain. In \"Casablanca\" the hero's love-interest and the Resistance leader's lovely young wife were one and the same person; here they are two different people, which means that there is no love-triangle as there was in the earlier film. \n\nI doubt if \"To Have and Have Not\" will ever rank as highly in the affections of the public as \"Casablanca\", one of the most beloved films of all time. The dramatic power of the earlier movie derives not only from its \"heroes and villains\" theme of the Resistance versus the Nazis but also from the inner struggles of Rick and Ilsa, both of whom must deal with the conflict between their desire for one another and their desire to assist the Allied cause. In \"To Have and Have Not\" Harry's own internal conflict is resolved pretty early on, so the only issue left is whether the French patriots or the pro-Vichy traitors will come out on top. (And, given that the film was made in 1944, we all know the answer to that one). \"How Little We Know,\" is unlikely ever to rival \"As Time Goes By\" in any list of \"great songs from the movies\", especially as Lauren Bacall did not have the world's most melodious singing voice. (There were persistent, although untrue, rumours that she was actually dubbed by a male singer). Virtually every other line in \"Casablanca\" has become a famous quotation, but there is little to compare in this film except perhaps \"Was You Ever Bitten by a Bee?\" and \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow\", a quote which has become famous largely because of the sexual innuendo with which Bacall manages to endow it. \n\nAnd yet \"To Have and Have Not\" is a very enjoyable wartime adventure film-cum-romance. Bogart gives another sterling performance in the sort of role he had made his own property, and the teenage Bacall, in her movie debut, shows that she had both the looks and the charisma which were to make her a major star. (A shame about her singing voice, though). This, of course, was the film where Bogart and Bacall first met and began the romance which was to end in their marriage. Walter Brennan provides some amusing comic relief as Morgan's drunken old reprobate of a crewman, Eddie. Besides Bacall the film also starred another beautiful young starlet, Dolores Moran, but somehow she never went on to become a star of quite the same magnitude. \n\nHemingway's novels have not always translated well to the cinema screen; the Rock Hudson/Jennifer Jones version of \"A Farewell to Arms\", for example, and the Gary Cooper/Ingrid Bergman \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" are both monuments of tedium. Although \"To Have and Have Not\", however, is generally rated as one of the author's lesser works (by many literary critics as well as by Hawks), the film version is nevertheless a pretty decent one. I think that Hawks won his bet. 7/10",

With the help of a certain husky voiced blonde (Lauren Bacall) with a crack for every situation, Bogart does just that. This adaption of a Hemingway story was changed from the rum-running world of Cuba to the fishing world of Martinique. It is full of snap, crackle and pop, and plenty of humor from tipsy Walter Brennan in another fine performance filled with heart. Bogart and Bacall really know how to light up the screen and would do so in three other films. I watched three of their four pairings back to back, and there is no doubt; They have \"it\". Real life couples don't always sizzle on screen, but this one does, especially here as this is where they discovered each other. But this is about the story, not the real-life soon to be married couple, and it is fascinating to watch Bogart go from uninvolved boat captain to a political hero who finally decides to stick his neck out for someone. There is a nice camaraderie between Bacall and piano player Hoagy Carmichael. The scene of \"Am I Blue?\" is particularly memorable as Bacall steps into sing, the drummer with the brush slowly comes in, and Bogart takes notice. Dan Seymour is the slimy Nazi villain, while Dolores Moran is fine in a smaller part as the French woman Bogart is trying to get out of Martinique along with her resistance husband (Walter Molnar).\n\nIt took me a long time to get to see this film for the first time, and it was worth the wait. They showed equal spark in their subsequent films (\"Dark Passage\" and \"Key Largo\", which I had seen years before, were the other two I watched after this; I've seen \"The Big Sleep\" numerous times) but Bacall is at her freshest here. She is one of the few stars to be a lead in her film debut that actually had a long lasting career. It is obvious that there is a tiger under the kittenish way she plays the part, and we've had more than 60 years of her wonderful face on stage, screen and television. The fishing sequence at the beginning is a great way to start the story. This is a film worth watching once a year to recall the magic, a rarity in cinema today. While there may be the obvious comparisons to \"Casablanca\" (an exotic location, a friendly piano player, an anti-Nazi sentiment), the film holds up on its own.",

                "text": "When interviewed in the 1970s, the director Howard Hawks made the claim that novelist Ernest Hemmingway described his book To Have and Have as his very worst; \"a pile of junk\". Whether Hemmingway really said this or not is uncertain. Hawks was a colourful character and any word from him should be read with a pinch or two of salt. The point however is clear, regardless of what the author thought, Hawks himself regarded the novel as junk. As such, when he filmed it he did not regard the story as important.\n\nSo what is important in this motion picture? Simple: Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Bogart was an old hand in the movies but he had only recently found his \"type\", the smart, laid-back individualist with a good heart under his hardened exterior. That persona was laid down in Casablanca a year or two earlier, but it was with To Have and Have Not that he met his perfect female companion. Lauren Bacall, a generation younger and in her first screen appearance, immediately projects a quality of her own that fits hand in glove with Bogart's. She's tough, intelligent, taking the attentions of a man because she wants them, not because she needs them, and a great mover who absorbs our attention the way a star should. All this comes through, not in her character as written, but in her reading of the character. This is very much the way things worked in old Hollywood \u0096 most actors would not mould themselves into their characters, they would mould the character around their own persona, which is no less a talent than method acting. Bacall was one of the last stars to adopt this style.\n\nHow much of a hand Hawks had in moulding this amazing tour-de-force in screen chemistry is again the subject of his own somewhat dubious boasts. But responsible or not he certainly understood it. One of Hawks's greatest talents was the smoothness with which he could move in and out of broad focus to individual focus, building realistic environments and then suddenly making the players stand out, with our barely noticing that anything has changed. The opening scene features some very complex but naturalistic looking crowd shots on the dock. Bogart emerges from this crowd, and suddenly all other business seems to melt away, so all we see is him. At the end of the scene Bogart literally disappears back into the crowd. Bacall's first appearance, the \"Anybody got a match?\" scene, is completely meaningless and irrelevant as a part of the narrative, and yet Hawks shoots it in an incredibly stripped down style, barely any props visible, the only lighting a couple of streaks to give her a bit of definition. The scene is transformed from a couple of throwaway lines into the most memorable few shots in the picture so far. Hawks even allows the charismatic presence of the two leads to override any build-up of suspense and danger. In the scene where they are interrogated by Vichy regime captain, when Bogart is asked to hand over the travellers' cheques, the shot is arranged so that our eyes are drawn to the figure between them \u0096 Bacall lighting up a cigarette with characteristic poise.\n\nOf course, it's not just Bogie and Bacall on display here. But neither is there really a semblance of Hemmingway's story. Everything that stands out in To Have and Have Not is a piece of characterisation. Take the pianist played by Hoagy Carmichael, when compared to the one played by Dooley Wilson in Casablanca. Wilson's Sam is integral to Casablanca's plot, but Carmichael's Cricket is integral to this picture's atmosphere. The great Walter Brennan is allowed to dominate many scenes, in what is one of the most endearing of his numerous crusty old man acts. The scene where the Vichy captain and his heavies try to get information out of Brennan over a couple of whisky bottles is played entirely for laughs, even though on paper the scene is clearly designed for suspense. It's very funny moment, with an almost Marx Brothers-ish tone of disrespect for authority.\n\nAnd yet, perhaps this version of To Have and Have Not goes a little too far in ignoring its source text. With only the threadbare remains of a political intrigue adventure, the picture lacks any real sense of danger or excitement. Rather than detracting from the delightful screen chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, such a touch could have heightened it. This is why, for example, the most suspenseful of Hitchcock pictures were also scintillating romances. As it is, To Have and Have Not is filled with layer upon layer of wonderful style, but lacks the substance at its core that would make it a masterpiece.",

But it turned out to be the beginning of a beautiful career, still going 66 years later, and the beginning of a beautiful relationship with the man who would become her husband, Humphrey Bogart. The film also stars Walter Brennan as Eddie.\n\nBogart's not in Casablanca anymore, though this film and that one have some common features: wartime, people trying to get out, a neutral person who can help but doesn't want to, a bar, a pianist, and a beautiful woman. Now Bogie's character is Harry Morgan, and with an alcoholic friend Eddie along, he hires out his boat in Martinique for fishing trips. The war has changed things, and money is tight, however. When Harry is approached by members of the Free French to transport members of the resistance to Martinique, Harry doesn't want to stick his neck out. But he needs the money. Into the middle of all this comes a beautiful brunette, Slim Browning, a singer who works her way from port to port.

It is possible that they recorded Williams' voice (he was 15 at the time) and decided not to use it. What Bacall lacks in vocal chops she makes up for in beauty, mystery, sex appeal, and screen presence, all of which she has in spades. She and Bogart have tremendous chemistry - well, that should be pretty obvious! Bogart does a great job as a rugged, tough, but fair guy who in spite of himself is in sympathy with the resistance, though he'll never admit it. Walter Brennan had a part like Eddie down to an art form by this time. But he doesn't play it as a stereotypical drunk. There's a sadness and loyalty about him. The striking Delores Moran plays the wife of the resistance worker.\n\nIn an interview she gave some years ago, Bacall said that, had Bogart lived, she would always have been married to him. She obviously not only loved him but admired him, and cherishes his memory to this day. Thanks to Warner Brothers, we get to see them at the beginning.

The one weakness of the script is that it invites comparison to \"Casablanca\", which is a tough yardstick for any film to measure up to.\n\nThe Hawks direction is well-handled but seldom draws attention to itself. The score is similarly solid but unmemorable. Instead, it's the cast and their performances that elevate the film above other adventure yarns. Bogart & Bacall exhibit considerable chemistry together while Walter Brennan proves to be a effective 'buddy' for Bogart's character. Also worthy of note is Hoagy Carmichael, who provides some musical support.\n\nUltimately, the film stands out by being an entertaining adventure yarn featuring Bogart and Bacall both doing what they do best. The rest is just icing on the cake.",

                "text": "While not the highlight of any of their star-studded careers, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Howard Hawks all must have had a great time on the set of this Ernest Hemingway-based story since they were all either in their prime or just hitting it. To make it even more memorable, Bogart was having marital problems and Hawks wanted to beef up Bacall's role to make her a star. So, the two began work almost exclusively together and perhaps the most famous Hollywood romance was born.\n\nAs for the film, there really isn't that much memorable than the heated chemistry between the two leads as the shoot went on. The story is well-told with a very wicked screenplay by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner. Plenty of great one-liners (\"I'm hard to get, Steve. All you have to do is ask.\") add to the mix as well as a very fine performance by Walter Brennan, a Hawks favorite, as a forgetful but likable drunk pal of Bogart. As I mentioned before, there really isn't much to discuss except that which lasted much longer than this film. However, these three would soon collaborate again on a film much more deep and well-received. But that is for another time and place.",

                "text": "If Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall occupy the same screen, you can safely expect fireworks. My first Bogart-Bacall collaboration was John Huston's 'Key Largo (1948),' a solid thriller with a brilliant performance from Edward G. Robinson. However, the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall was surprisingly lacking, and, at the time, I wondered why there was such a fascination for the couple. Recent viewings of Howard Hawks' 'The Big Sleep (1946)' and 'To Have and Have Not (1944)' have completely swayed my opinion, and I am now in no doubt of the pair's potency: the sexual chemistry positively sizzles while they're both on screen! This particular film was Bacall's debut performance, the picture that introduced both audiences and Bogart {he would marry her the following year} to one of cinema's most iconic beauties, fondly remembered for her erotically husky voice. 'To Have and Have Not' is an interesting mixture of war-time adventure and hard-boiled film-noir, set on the island of Martinique under the Vichy regime, and Bogart's Harry \"Steve\" Morgan is forced to navigate swathes of low-lifes and immoral authority figures.\n\nHoward Hawks, perhaps Hollywood's most versatile master director, was a considerable fan of author Ernest Hemingway, but didn't think all too highly of his 1937 effort, \"To Have and Have Not.\" Taking it upon himself to improve the story, Hawks set his writers upon Hemingway's \"bunch of junk,\" and created what is considered by some to be one of his best films. With its abundance of pistol-clad gangsters and Bogart's legendary noble tough-guy, comparisons with other pulp film-noirs {such as 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' and Hawks' own 'The Big Sleep'} are perfectly justified, as are the noticeable parallels with Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca (1942),' with its intriguing war-time tale of romance and loyalty, in addition to a suitably ambiguous ending that emphasises the sheer uncertainty of warfare. A hilarious Walter Brennan provides the comedic relief as Eddie, a well-meaning but hopelessly addicted alcoholic who likes to ask people such inane queries as \"was you ever bit by a dead bee?\" Marcel Dalio, in a role that would ideally have suited Peter Lorre, is also good as Frenchy, the sincere owner of the local hotel with sympathies for the French Resistance.\n\nWhat ultimately separates a good film like 'To Have and Have Not' from a masterpiece like, say, 'Casablanca,' is the depth of the characters. By the end of the latter film, we feel as though we've known Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) for their entire lives, and we feel pain for their romantic sorrows. Howard Hawks has always been more concerned with witty dialogue than character development, and, though there's no doubting the sheer entertainment of his pictures, they are rarely able to strike a chord close to the heart. Most of this film's characters are little more than two-dimensional caricatures, and the camera, in order to avoid distracting from the excellence of the screenplay, does little of any interest. 'To Have and Have Not' is certainly a solid film, but it's not exactly \"exciting\" film-making, with the exception, of course, of the coupling of Bogart and Bacall, which was a stroke of genius on Hawks' part. Also notable is the musical soundtrack, with Hoagy Carmichael appearing as a hotel piano player to perform \"Hong Kong Blues,\" and Bacall singing \"How Little We Know.\"",

Bogart plays the role as Steve Morgan, who is a sea captain and is an adventurer who will make a buck doing anything to bring people who are trapped during a period of the French Resistance.

Steve falls head over heels for Slim and they wind up having a fire burning between the both of them.

It is a fine quasi-remake of Casablanca (1942) with Humphrey Bogart playing essentially the same kind of character he played in Casablanca, a worldly wise, cynical America ex-pat who doesn't want to get involved in politics as the storm clouds of World War II gather. Instead of a saloon in Casablanca Bogie has a fishing boat in Martinique. Instead of Ingrid Bergman he has Lauren Bacall. Instead of Claude Rains as perfect of police, he has Dan Seymour as Capt. Renard working for the Germans. Instead of Dooley Wilson to play the piano and sing, he has Hoagy Carmichael. Instead of Peter Lorre as a sniveling lowlife, he has Walter Brennan as an alcoholic friend. In either case, Bogie ends up helping the Free French even though he'd rather not get involved.\n\nThis was Lauren Bacall's debut. She was 22-years-old and legend has it that she and Bogart, who was in his forties, fell in love during the filming. She plays a sultry babe with a hard edge, and she does it very well. Her famous line, \"You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? You just put your lips together and blow\" more or less defined her character.\n\nI found Walter Brennan's Eddie annoying, but then I never liked lushes. Dan Seymour is memorable as the portly man with a scar who speaks with weighty precision as he works for the Vichy government. Hoagy Carmichael warbles a tune or two and Dolores Moran looks good enough to eat. Howard Hawks' direction is sharp and focused, although supposedly he was eating his heart out because Bacall preferred Bogart over him.\n\nClearly this is all about Bogart and Bacall, probably their best work together. They seem delighted with one another. And they were.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

Bacall- in her best and sexiest role other than the Big Sleep, she never looked this good again and by the 50's was playing matrons. As for Bogart, like wine he get's better and better , somehow able to telegraph in the most natural way every emotion at his fingertips, very believable in every scene in that slightly at odds , suspicious, but in the end decent way of his. A truly great actor in one of his best movies.",

                "text": "'To Have And Have Not' is such a mishmash, it's hard to know how to feel about it. It was 1944's entry in the 'Casablanca' wannabe series of films, and of course it's one up on all the others by virtue of starring Humphrey Bogart and being produced by Warner Bros. But the storyline and several supporting characters are vastly inferior to that 'timeless classic.' A few scenes are great, a few are adequate, and several are stupid beyond belief. What 'To Have And Have Not' really has going for it is Lauren Bacall, in her first big role. This must be the film people are referring to when they talk about a 'star-making vehicle.' Bacall steals every scene she's in, and is so good she almost makes you forget about the movie's obvious flaws, 'almost' being the operative word. Bogart is Bogart, and he manages to stand apart from the script's weaknesses for the most part by sheer force of personality. He shines most in his scenes with Bacall, but also in a few others where we see him in charge, utterly cool as always, as only Bogie can be. Three supporting characters do their best to sink the film though, in differing ways. Walter Brennan is quite believable as Eddie, the drunk sidekick, but the character is so annoying and unamusing that you find yourself wishing he would die of alcohol poisoning. The legendary composer Hoagy Carmichael portrays Cricket, the piano player, obviously intended to be another 'Sam' a la Dooley Wilson in 'Casablanca.' But whatever Carmichael's gifts as a songwriter, he's no actor and the character adds nothing to the film. And you may find yourself questioning even his musical skills, as the tunes he sings at various points are uniformly awful. Finally, there is Dan Seymour as Captain Renard, local police chief. Seymour gives an astonishingly bad performance, speaking with a ludicrous accent (what is it supposed to be? French? Hungarian?) that wouldn't convince a cow. The plot finds Bogart's character, Harry Morgan (yes, that's really his name) as a skipper-for-hire who gets drawn into helping a group of Free French smuggle one of their own onto the island of Martinique. And speaking of the character's name, Bacall calls him 'Steve' throughout the film, for reasons that are unclear to me. Some credits show his character as Harry 'Steve' Morgan. Go figure. And speaking of annoyances as we were a moment ago, poor Harry/Steve is harassed and pestered throughout the film... by Eddie, by Frenchie, by his customer Johnson, by the portmaster, by Captain Renard, by the Free French, by the guy he's hired to pick up and his annoying wife. There's hardly a scene with Bogart in it where someone doesn't bust in and want something. You finally want to reach into the screen and grab the other characters by the hair and yell, \"Leave the poor guy alone!\" To be fair, there are some exciting moments towards the end of the film; the final shot shows Brennan's Eddie, Bacall's Slim, and Bogart's Harry/Steve leaving the bar to the strains of Carmichael's piano playing, and you are reminded once again of what a mixed viewing experience 'To Have And Have Not' has been.",

They are forced to take a job for the resistance transporting a fugitive away from the Nazis, and as this goes on Morgan is having a stormy relationship with resistance sympathiser and sassy singer (where Morgan spend most of his time), Marie 'Slim' Browning (introducing Lauren Bacall). There are many moments of witty and charming dialogue in the romantic scenes, and great explosions of wartime peril that you keep you gripped, I thought Bacall's singing voice was a little weird, but she is still a sexy character with a great husky talking voice. Also starring Dolores Moran as Mme. Hellene De Bursac, Hoagy Carmichael as Cricket, Walter Szurovy as Paul De Bursac and Sheldon Leonard as Lt. Coyo. I have to admit there were moments where I trailed off and didn't understand what was going on, but I can certainly see why the critics give it high praise. Humphrey Bogart was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor, Lauren Bacall was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, the film was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (\"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?

Rather impossible if we take into consideration the phenomenal performance of Walter Brennan, the HOT beginning of the Bogart-Bacall relationship and of course, the one and only Hoagy Carmichael.\n\nMy story begins in the late 1950's. I was composing rock and roll tunes, a few of which were published by Southern Music Publishing Company, Peer International in the NYC Brill Building {Tin Pan Alley]. I had brought in a 7\" reel of tunes I had composed, had been heard by a local disc jockey who then set up the appointment for me. As the A&R man was listening in a sound proof booth, I decided to go wandering to look at all the gold records on the wall. I stopped upon hearing the tinkling of a piano coming from behind a closed door.\n\nI opened it and walked in. There at the piano sat a skinny guy at a piano, He had a cigarette dangling from his lips. Being a hot shot, I told him how famous a composer I was going to be and asked if he had ever written anything noteworthy. He said yes and started playing something that sounded less than noteworthy. And I told him so. He replied, \"That's just the intro kid---here's the song.\" It was \"STARDUST\" and the man at the piano was Hoagy Carmichael.\n\nI was embarrassed and told him so. As he continued playing that monumental tune, his words to me were, \"Get outta music, kid. It'll break your heart.\" I did eventually because he was right.\n\nAnd there he sat as \"Cricket\" tickling the ivories in \"To Have and Have Not.\" Yes indeed, it was the man I met about twelve years later. That in itself caused me to like the film. Was it a great story? No. Bogart, like in \"Casablanca,\" the best American film ever made, was again cynical who refused to stick his neck out for anyone. He wanted nothing to do with either France's Vichy government or the Free French who hated it. His boat was for fishing only and to heck with politics. But in time he got patriotic thanks to lack of money...I can put it no other way.\n\nThe love affair and marriage of Bogart and Bette Perskey a.k.a Lauren Bacall is the stuff legends are made of. Sounds like a line from \"The Maltese Falcon\" doesn't it? I think Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44 when this film was made and the very apparent real life sensuality and seduction were palpable. How could Bogart distance himself from any gal who instructed him on how to whistle? \"Just put your two lips together and blow.\" One of the best remembered sentences from any movie.\n\nAnd of course we know how fond Bogart was of sailing. I wonder if the boat in the film was his \"Santana?\" It makes no difference but nonetheless it was obvious how much he loved the sea. I can think of no people other than Bogart and Bacall to make Hemingway's novel come to life.\n\nThis picture was perfect for a true blue nostalgiaphile but not for anyone who's interested only in plots, acting and so forth and so on. It's an entertaining and interesting look at the union of Hollywood legends because there'll never be a couple like B & B. They caused that celluloid to smoulder.",

This is quite clear when you notice his relationship with the nice fool Eddie (played by an enjoyable Walter Brennan) and later on in the film when he helps out fugitives to get on shore, only for the money, so he says.

Hoagy Carmichael provides quirky background music in the dark and evocative bar/motel. There is one song in particular with an Oriental theme, quite interesting.\n\nBogart is a local captain in a somewhat unlikely surrounding (reminescent of another excellent film with he and Bacall, \"Key Largo,do not miss). He and Bacall collide, she is only 19, but sophisticated as ever, and stubborn.\n\nWalter Brennan is also good as Bogart's sidekick/assistant on the small boat. Bacall runs out of money and is trapped on Martinique, which seems precarious...but exciting.\n\nThis film with its atmosphere, intrigue and talent could never be remade with any actors today. Bacall is beautiful and strong, Bogart craggy and rough, together they make suspense and romance blend perfectly, no trite and banal story here. 10/10. Another excellent film with them is \"Dark Passage\", highly recommended.",

However, since the second world war is happening around them business is not what it could be and after a customer who owes them a large sum fails to pay they are forced against their better judgment to violate their preferred neutrality and to take a job for the resistance transporting a fugitive on the run from the Nazis to Martinique. Through all this runs the stormy relationship between Morgan and Marie \"Slim\" Browning, a resistance sympathizer and the sassy singer in the club where Morgan spends most of his days.",
            "In the summer of 1940 American Harry Morgan lives in Martinique, a French colony in the Caribbean. He takes tourists out sports fishing and tries his best to mind his own business, especially when it comes to politics as the Nazis have just invaded France. Unable to collect from a client who is killed by a stray bullet and in need of cash, Morgan agrees to smuggle a Free French leader onto the island. With the help of a new friend, Marie 'Slim' Browning and his pal Eddie, he tries to stay one step ahead of the local secret police. Morgan quickly realizes he needs to get out of Martinique but complications arise forcing him to take sides in the fight after all.",
            "The tense situation in Nazi occupied France also hits the French colony Martinique in the Caribbean. In its capital Fort de France an American sea captain, Harry Morgan, has some trouble with the local authorities, who is all the time spying on possible collaborators of the resistance movement. But Harry Morgan is a recluse, who doesn't want to be involved in anything. He keeps all persons at a distance, except the alcoholic sailor Eddie, who he cares for. A young woman, Marie Browning, age 22, moves into Hotel Marquis in the room opposite his. She immediately captures his interest, and she is also affected by him. Morgan thinks this isn't a proper milieu for a young woman, and wants to help her get back home. To be able to pay her flight ticket, he contacts the resistance movement, saying he accepts transporting two persons from Anguilla to Martinique with his fishing boat in the night, if he is well paid. During the operation they are spotted by a patrol boat, but Morgan extinguishes their lantern by a gunshot, and slips away with his boat. Next morning S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale, the French equivalent to Gestapo, suspects Morgan for being the one who brought two resistance fighters to Martinique and tries to press him to reveal their hiding place."

A pity! \n\nChad Hanna (Henry Fonda) is a country farm boy who helps a black slave to escape, and then runs away with a circus together with a slave tracker's daughter (Linda Darnell). Originally dazzled by a seemingly glamorous circus performer (Dorothy Lamour), Chad eventually falls in love with the daughter and marries her, and they both make the circus their way of life. Nothing very enthralling happens, and the charm of the film comes from watching famous people early in their careers.\n\nLinda Darnell is particular is a revelation. She was about seventeen years of age when she made \"Chad Hanna\", yet already her rapport with the camera is evident. So too is the warmth of her personality and the skill of her underplaying. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see why she became a big star, but what is intriguing is that in \"Chad Hanna\" Dorothy Lamour, who was already a big star, no longer seems attractive or interesting. It is not obvious why she was so popular at that time. Henry Fonda, of course, was already a movie \"natural\". He never seems to be acting, but somehow he is always both likable and believable. Fonda really holds this movie together.\n\n20th Century Fox was the first major studio to master colour in movies. In the late 'thirties and early 'forties, most colour in films was garish and gaudy, but several Fox films had really beautiful colour, and \"Chad Hanna\" is one of them.\n\n\"Chad Hanna\" is certainly a throw-back to the past, and quite possibly people who judge movies only in terms of their kinetic imagery will find it slow. For those who are not stimulated by violence and synthetic excitement, \"Chad Hanna\" is well worth watching.",

The other two were his debut film The Farmer Takes A Wife and the John Ford classic Drums Along The Mohawk. Though Chad Hanna is the least of the three it's still an entertaining film and Fonda could play these rustic characters well, investing in them a sense of dignity and strength.\n\nHe's got the title role in Chad Hanna who's a farm boy who gets a yen to join the traveling circus after seeing a poster of Dorothy Lamour as a bareback rider. That's Hank's hormones talking there, but later on another runaway in the person of Linda Darnell and it's the two of them that are fated for each other\n\nThe circus business back in the day was one dangerous profession and I'm not just talking about under the big top. Guy Kibbee and Jane Darwell's show is plagued by the much bigger outfit that Ted North runs and he wants them out of business. North even steals Lamour away from Kibbee's show, but that only serves to give Darnell a break and making her the top bareback rider.\n\nJust the names I've mentioned so far indicate that Chad Hanna has a cast of some colorful players and you can add John Carradine to that list as well as Kibbee's advance man. One thing I don't understand is why Kibbee thought Fonda would make a good ringmaster when Kibbee was injured in a fracas with North's show. He promoted the shy Fonda over Carradine who has one of the great voices in the English language. Go figure that one. \n\nDespite that faux pas, Chad Hanna remains a fine film done in nice technicolor and does capture the flavor of rural western New York back in the next to last century.",

Really, the whole picture looks good. The problem is the story is dull and some of the acting is sub-par. Considering this cast, I expected better. Darnell's often spotty so I wasn't phased by her weak performance. But I was disappointed in Henry Fonda, whose rube routine was annoying. He reunites with his Grapes of Wrath costars John Carradine and Jane Darwell, both of whom are fine in this. Dorothy Lamour stands out the most.

While it's a very good film, it is a bit slow and if you are looking for huge thrills and excitement, you might be a bit disappointed--even though it is a film about the circus.

Chad Hanna (Henry Fonda) is a country boy who gets himself into trouble trying to help a runaway slave. So, he takes refuge with a traveling circus run by Guy Kibbee and Jane Darwell (who is wearing a fat suit for the movie). There, he becomes infatuated with a lady trick rider (Dorothy Lamour). At the same time, a young lady (Linda Darnell) runs away from her abusive father--the same guy who is the scum-bag tracking down the escaped slave. Over time, Hanna Fonda's character falls for Darnell and they marry. What happens next you'll need to see for yourself.\n\nThere are a few exciting moments here and there--but not that many. Even the film's big crisis near the end isn't THAT big--and it resolves itself rather quickly and easily. But the film is fun and it's worth seeing for the acting. In particular, it's amazing to see how beautiful and poised Darnell is--as she' only 17 when she made the film. This does, by the way, make her love scenes with Fonda a bit....ooky. Still, it's well worth seeing.\n\nTwentieth Century-Fox must have had high expectations for this film, as it was made in beautiful Technicolor--something reserved for only a few movies this year since it was very expensive to make a color film at this time.\n\nAlso, if you care, one of the thugs at the 34 minute mark in the film is Rondo Hatton in an unbilled role--he's the one that talks, by the way.\n\nTwentieth Century-Fox must have had high expectations for this film, as it was made in beautiful Technicolor--something reserved for only a few movies this year since it was very expensive to make a color film at this time.",

                "text": "I just loved that part of the movie when Chad Hanna, all resplendent in his ringmaster's uniform, is seeking to imitate A.D's confidant introduction. Circus movies have always been my guilty secret - I just love them and could definitely remember the name \"Chad Hanna\" from my childhood (watching it on TV). It was a lovely, rambling, watch it on a rainy afternoon story about the trials and tribulations of a small time circus that toured the American countryside in the 1840s. 20th Century Fox was one of the first studios to fully explore the possibilities of Technicolor and it gave this movie a richness and the magnificent beauty of Linda Darnell was greatly enhanced by it. This was at the beginning of her career when her fresh naturalness was just breath taking. Walter D. Edmond's books - \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" (1935) and \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" (1939) had already been filmed and had found a perfect actor to portray their strong and honorable heroes in Henry Fonda.\n\nIn \"Chad Hanna\" he was absolutely splendid as the title character, a dreamy farm boy whose determination to help a runaway slave and to see \"the most beautiful lady I've ever laid eyes on\" - bareback rider Albany Yates (Dorothy Lamour) perform at the circus, has both him and Caroline (Linda Darnell) running for their lives. She has been beaten by her father, who is also after Chad, so they both run away with the circus. The supporting cast is like a \"Who's Who\" of the best players in Hollywood - Guy Kibbee as harassed circus owner A.D., Jane Darwell as his wife, John Carradine and Roscoe Ates. \n\nEven though beautiful Caroline silently loves him, Chad has only eyes for the proud Albany, who soon shows her true colors by being easily lured over to the rival circus and leaving them now without a star attraction. A.D has always bemoaned the fact that the one addition that would put them in the big time is an elephant and now they have to train up Caroline to take Albany's place. I agree with the other reviewer, for all her regalness, Dorothy Lamour seems to be only going through the motions and then half way through she is gone!! Although the new up and coming glamour girl on the Fox lot was Linda Darnell - Lamour was a Paramount player - so it stands to reason which one was going to have the bigger, more sympathetic part.\n\nA.D's circus is always in danger of being run out of business by their bigger, flashier rival - Shepley's Circus. Shepley's even employ their own \"goons\", always at the ready , armed with poles to prevent A.D's from participating in the street parade and, in the most exciting scene in the movie, threatening to burn down A.D's circus. After that riot A.D ends up in hospital and hands over the Ring Master's mantle to Chad (in my opinion John Carradine would have been the best choice - he even looked and sounded like a Ring Master) but the death of their lion - their main attraction has Chad sent from the circus in disgrace. Sure, not a great deal happens in the movie, but how Chad returns with a circus act that A.D. never dreamed they would ever have is quite exciting stuff. It also looks suspiciously like Rondo Hatton as a circus workman.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

D. Bisbee (John Carradine) works as the advance agent for the Huguenine Circus, garnering attention wherever he goes, building up the audience to a fever pitch by emphasizing both male AND female acrobats...in tights! In the title role, Henry Fonda performs another expert character study, playing a Canastota stable boy who literally runs away to join the circus to escape a vengeful slave catcher whose daughter Caroline (Linda Darnell) later joins him, also a victim of her father's rage. Chad instantly falls for equestrienne Albany Yates (Dorothy Lamour), the star attraction for this one ring circus, but she soon spurns Huguenine for a rival circus that has an elephant. It's a shame that the filmmakers chose to showcase the dramatically anemic, predictably absurd romantic triangle over the more interesting circus life rarely depicted at that time. Fonda and Carradine are teamed for the fifth and last time, from \"Jesse James,\" \"Drums Along the Mohawk,\" \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" and \"The Return of Frank James.\" Carradine was no stranger to lovely Linda Darnell- \"Brigham Young,\" \"Blood and Sand,\" \"Fallen Angel,\" and the 1958 WAGON TRAIN, \"The Dora Gray Story.\" After such a powerful introduction, Carradine instantly fades into the background, disappearing completely after Chad and Caroline marry 54 minutes in. Sharp eyed viewers can catch canvasman Rondo Hatton at the 34 minute mark, looking quite menacing on the far right, one line of dialogue spoken in his own voice: \"all right men, up to the next street!\"",

Roland Young, who delighted us in the original Topper with Cary Grant, plays the befuddled count who plans to marry Die Marlene on the pretext she's an innocent young darling.  The scene where the New Orleans ladies take Marlene aside to give her a little lecture on the \"burden of womanhood she'll have to endure\" after her marriage is priceless, with the tiny smirk that plays across Marlene's face (given her well-known history, it makes it doubly funny).  While this little film isn't (and wasn't)a great shake at the box office at the time, it is delightful to see Die Marlene, always beautiful in that classic, classy European sense, at her best. ",

                "text": "This is not a great film but it is entertaining and frothy. Rene Clair, like Jean Renoir, fled France for the United States and made movies in Hollywood. But Renoir concentrated on serious films, like \"This Land is Mine\" and \"The Southerner\". Clair made comedies, of which this and \"I Married a Witch\" were the best ones. In \"Flame of New Orleans\" Clare tackled a sex romp in the Big Easy of the 1840s. He succeeds in capturing the charm of the great town, and (with maybe one or two exceptions) produced the best film about New Orleans and it's Gallic flavor.\n\nMarlene Dietrich is an international adventuress (we subsequently realize she has been as far from New Orleans as St. Petersburg, Russia). She is as sexually alluring as ever, and has got the pleasant attention of Roland Young a rich banker. While Young woos her she also attracts the attention of ship captain Bruce Cabot, who is more to her taste in form, but not in terms of money. She plays her game with Cabot and gets him into debt. Meanwhile she pursues a willing Young, only to first find a number of men who knew her in the past, and then find that Cabot is getting into her hair. So she tries to create a twin cousin situation. But this complicates the situation even more.\n\nThe character actors like Mischa Auer (frantically trying to retrieve his top hat before he gets challenged to a duel), or Melville Cooper (cornered by his loveless marriage wife, and ending up being unexpectedly blunt), or even Shemp Howard (who has the freshest wine cellar in New Orleans) have excellent moments to shine in this film's comedy. It is a marvelously funny confection which I recommend",

The plot is too complicated to describe here, but the story is very clever and very entertaining. The film is sweet, romantic and quite funny. The cast is exceptional. Bruce Cabot is surprisingly great as the leading man. You might remember him as the block of wood who won out over the monkey in King Kong. He must have gained some talent as he aged; he's much more handsome at this point, and has an effortless charm, reminiscent of Clark Gable. Roland Young plays his rival. One thing I'll always love about Golden Age Hollywood is the bevy of character actors, something we have entirely lost in the present. Here we have Mischa Auer, Anne Revere, Andy Devine, Theresa Harris and Franklin Pangborn.

She sets her sights on Roland Young (from \"Topper\"), who has scads of money. She also has a particular habit of fainting, which she uses to her advantage, whenever it serves her purpose or whenever she doesn't know else to get out of a particular situation. Roland starts to pursue her, but doesn't realize he was already picked from the beginning. She tries to be hard to get, but just enough to get what she wants.\n\nEnter Bruce Cabot who of course meets her in such a way as to antagonize her without them actually seeing each other. When her plans get mixed up with Roland and her reputation gets compromised by a rumor, she resorts to drastic measures.\n\nI had never seen this and loved it, obviously by my rating. Marlene and Bruce's chemistry, its use of time and place, the imagery and colors of the clothes of the time, and its expressive grand music made for the most perfect 80 minutes spent on a movie in a long time.\n\nFeaturing a slew of recognizable faces including Mischa Auer, Andy Devine, Franklin Pangborn, Melville Cooper, Laura Hope Crews (\"Aunt Pittypat\" from \"Gone with the Wind\"), Anne Revere (Oscar winner for \"National Velvet\" as the mother), and Eddie Quillan, this is one movie not to be missed.\n\nEddie Quillan? You don't know him? Sure, you do. You've seen him. You just didn't know it. He was a prolific supporting actor in movies in bit parts like this one and also made memorable appearances in 50s and 60s TV shows, like \"The Addams Family.\" His most famous role was probably that in \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" \n\nDirected by Rene Clair who also made \"Le Million\", which I reviewed, and \"A Nous La Liberte,\" (some say that is his masterpiece, but I have yet to see, but will) this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest, and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!",

Perhaps it might have been a much better film had the two leading men she wanted been available.\n\nAccording to a recent biography of Marlene Dietrich, the two men she wanted for The Flame Of New Orleans were Cary Grant and Adolphe Menjou. She had worked with both before, Menjou in Morocco and Grant in Blonde Venus. She liked Menjou and sad to say MGM wouldn't make him available. At the time she and Cary Grant did not get along all that well, he played the other man in Blonde Venus. But in the interim he had gotten superstardom so Dietrich thought that Grant might prove to be a good screen partner now. Alas, that screen team was never to be.\n\nMarlene and her maid Theresa Harris arrive in New Orleans where from the outset it's made plain to the viewer that Dietrich is out to hook a rich fish from the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. The one she looks to land is rich and fussy Roland Young and she does bait a trap for him. But a roistering sea captain played by Bruce Cabot spoils it all for her though eventually Young falls for her as expected.\n\nNow if you can't figure out who she winds up with, there's something terribly wrong with you.\n\nCabot does give a strong performance as the captain, I'm sure he was a rougher type than Cary Grant would have been. Of course as was usual with Marlene and her leading man, the obligatory affair was had. But she also said she found Cabot to be something of a boor and dropped him quickly.\n\nTheresa Harris had a very interesting and unusual role for a black actress of the time. She might be a maid, but she functions more like a partner in crime with Dietrich's schemes. She's nobody's fool in this film and even gets a love interest of sorts in Young's driver Clarence Muse.\n\nThe film did get an Oscar nomination for Best Art&Interior Direction and the sets were grand. Rene Clair did a very good job of conveying New Orleans of 1841. Still the film is minor league Dietrich and it could have been a lot better if she had gotten the players she wanted as co-stars.",

I enjoyed the relationship between the Countess and her African American maid, Clementine, in the film as her friend and confidante. The countess has too many suitors much like any Marlene Dietrich film. The one suitor is a poor sailor with a pet monkey and the other is Giraud, an older, wealthy but unattractive man. In this film, the Countess is expected to get married like all women are expected to do in this day and age. The film begins with a mystery of a wedding dress found in the Mississippi River.

This certainly gives the film a very dull flavor because there's just nothing here to keep us overly amused and especially when you consider that the Dietrich-Cabot-Young love triangle isn't nearly the best we've seen from the previous films.

The bulk of the insipid plot line is told through the gossipy sniveling of the wealthy townsfolk, particularly Russian visitor Mischa Auer and his prissy sidekick Franklin Pangborn, with Laura Hope Crews and Anne Revere as Young's annoying family thrown in, kinsfolk which rightfully make Dietrich wince. Andy Devine and a cute little monkey provide what little humor there is.\n\nThe black servant played by Theresa Harris is a breath of fresh air, a beautiful and intelligent young lady not chubby and flamboyant like Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniels' characters, or dimwitted like diminutive Butterfly McQueen, but a realistic and likable young lady who just happens to be black. There's a cute romantic subplot for her and Young's valet, played by Rex Evans. The non-stereotypical manner in which these characters are treated is a rare delight in old movies.\n\nTold in flashback as if it were one of John Nesbitt's Passing Parade shorts (MGM's series of historical based films made throughout the 1930's and 40's), this claims to be a New Orleans legend, but there isn't anything in this plot to indicate any interest other than local gossip.

When she meets older and very ordinary looking short rich guy (Roland Young), she instantly pretends to be in love with him. At about the same time, she also meets a rugged ship's captain (Bruce Cabot). You can tell that sparks are flying between them, but she resists because he isn't rich and so she ardently pursues Young throughout most of the film.\n\nHowever, all this is thrown for a loop when a couple foreigners see Marlene and recognize her as a \"good time girl\" they'd met in St. Petersburg, Russia. So, in order to convince Young that she is as sweet and innocent as she's pretended to be, she invents the notion that this is a cousin. But, when he isn't totally convinced, Marlene begins to play both roles. This is EXACTLY the sort of funny situations this movie desperately needed to inject some life into it.

The back-and-white photography is stunningly good--the best American photography in a black-and-white 1940's American film,aside from \"Citizen Kane\",of course.\n\nJohn Wayne fans shouldn't pass this one up,and all non-fans should still enjoy this fine film.",

                "text": "The Long Voyage Home is a compilation film of four one act plays by Eugene O'Neill who some will argue is America's greatest dramatist. The man who did the stitching together of O'Neill's work about the crew of the S.S. Glencairn is Dudley Nichols and presiding over it all is the direction of John Ford.\n\nMr. Ford is usually someone who really puts an individual stamp on one of his movies. But the usual Ford trademarks are noticeably absent from The Long Voyage Home. Probably in mood and style the film of Ford's this comes closest to is The Informer. In fact J.M. Kerrigan is playing almost the same part in this as he did in The Informer.\n\nOne thing Ford always did was use the right kind of music to set the tone for a film. Those 19th century ballads like I Dream of Jeannie that work so well in something like Stagecoach are substituted for Harbor Lights. That song expresses so well the longing of a whole bunch of rootless men to find some kind of stability in their lives.\n\nEugene O'Neill spent many years at sea and the characters of these men on the S.S. Glencairn are drawn from his own youthful experience. Most of our planet is covered by water and no country owns it. It's just called the high seas and the seamen on it are an international fraternity, like the S.S. Glencairn crew. I've always felt that O'Neill was trying to say that if there's any salvation to be had in this old world, it's to be found on the salt water. It's the only place where all kinds of people really work for a common goal, stay alive and make the trip.\n\nThe original plays had a World War I background, but it has been updated for World War II. Especially in the part when the crew becomes convinced that Ian Hunter is some kind of spy. Certainly the second World War in 1940 gave the audiences some real interest. Ian Hunter may have given his career performance in this as Smitty. Turns out he's far from what everyone suspects.\n\nHard to believe that John Wayne would be in a film by one of our greatest dramatists. But the Duke holds his own in the ensemble. It's the only time he ever attempted some kind of accent and he pulls it off. But I'm sure he thought once was enough.\n\nWayne as Olsen is the innocent of the group, maybe the only time he's ever been that on the screen. The rest of the crew makes every effort to see he does in fact get home to Sweden. It turns out to cost one of them his life ultimately. \n\nIf you're any kind of depressed, The Long Voyage Home or any Eugene O'Neill is not good for your mental health. He's one pessimistic fellow that O'Neill. But his insights into our character and soul are always penetrating as they are in The Long Voyage Home.",

The worlds of Ford and O'Neill overlap in their use of sentiment, tragicomedy, and the sons of old Ireland.  This episodic collection of stories, taken from several short plays written by O'Neill and based on his own seafaring life, does what both O'Neill and Ford do best--unveil the poetry and tragedy of simple men.  Granted, Ford outsentimentalizes O'Neill, who can be far darker than Ford ever dared, but he comes by it honestly--no Capra-corn here.  The photography and sound bring a hyper-reality to this tale of merchant sailors, fearful for their lives, argumentative yet loving, full of weakness but capable of strength and honor.  The performances are uniformly splendid.  John Wayne, in a supporting role, does quite well with an unusual part, a lonely Swedish sailor, and his accent is much better than he is usually given credit for.  But this is no star vehicle.  The ship is the star, and the lives of its men resound with meaning and melancholy. An extraordinary film experience, especially for the patient and thoughtful among us.",

                "text": "\nThe Long Voyage home is not a typical film from this period. It differs in that it focuses on an ensemble cast instead of on a star. That's common nowadays, but not back then. Ford's Stagecoach, made the previous year, had quite an ensemble cast, but the film was always focused on Ringo and Dallas. Here, John Wayne is just one of the stars. Thomas Mitchell, who played Doc Washburn in Stagecoach, has a role that's as big as Wayne's in Voyage. Others are as prominent.\n\nThe plot is also pretty tenuous and episodic. And, unlike most films of the time, the focus was not on a goal, but just on the events and lives of the seaman aboard the Glencairn. We see them sail through the war-torn Atlantic, between the U.S. and Europe. They have fun, they fight, they talk about home. It's all rather gentle and beautiful, very subtle. The script is great, which is probably due to Eugene O'Neil, for of whose plays this film is based on (they are blended together seamlessly).\n\nThe actors are marvelous. Mitchell and Wayne are probably the best known, but there are also Ian Hunter, Barry Fitzgerald, John Qualen, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and many other great character actors. John Wayne was probably the draw, considering how popular Stagecoach had made him, but, as I said, his role is not out in the front. In fact, he doesn't have many lines. His schtick is that he is a Swede who can't speak English well, so he is generally pretty quiet (Wayne can't muster the best Swedish accent, either, so that's kind of a good thing!). He has one great scene where he has some long bits of dialogue. But even without the dialogue, he emotes so well in his face. I knew his character intimately by the end of the film. We don't often think of Wayne as a great actor, but he certainly was. Although The Searchers probably contains his best role, The Long Voyage Home would certainly be worth a major mention when talking about his career.\n\n\nIf you could say that there is a single \"star\" of this film, that would have to be Greg Tolland. Of course, he photographed Citizen Kane in the next year, as well as Ford's Best Picture winning How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes of Wrath. The cinematography is some of the most impressive to be found in the American cinema. John Ford himself is just as much the star of The Long Voyage Home. He definitely put his heart into this one. The direction is beautiful, artful. It is as good here as it is in The Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, and The Searchers, that is, it is one of his very best films, if not THE best. To date, it's the only Ford film that made me shed tears. 10/10.",

                "text": "An expressionistic classic featuring John Wayne as a Swede? Can it be?\n\n\"The Long Voyage Home\" may fall just short of classic status, but it is one of Hollywood's most visually expressionistic films, a tone poem of shadow and light presented by director John Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland. That is indeed the Duke himself, John Wayne, playing a Swedish hayseed named Ole Olsen who the other sailors aboard his ship want to see safely en route to home. He's not Meryl Streep as it turns out, but you will want to see this powerhouse example of Hollywood art anyway for Toland's camera-work, the ensemble acting, and Dudley Nichols' seamless adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's four one-act plays.\n\nO'Neill's sea yarns are transported to the then-present. World War II is underway, and the Glencairn transports ammunition to England for the fight against Hitler. Will Ole return home? What is the secret behind quiet English sailor Smitty (Ian Hunter)? Why are women bearing baskets of fruit not to be trusted? Why is Driscoll (Thomas Mitchell) so suspicious of that bartender?\n\nPauline Kael once wrote up \"Long Voyage Home\" by way of addressing another film shot by Gregg Toland the following year, \"Citizen Kane.\" Both Ford and \"Kane\" director Orson Welles took the unusual step of sharing their titles card with Toland, a show of respect for what Toland's eye brought to their films. I'd say Toland brought more to \"Long Voyage Home\" than he did to \"Kane,\" as every shot seems suffused with a tenseness and mood that at the very least speaks as eloquently to the drama on screen as any line of dialogue or actor's performance.\n\nThat's true from the opening shot, a wordless pan shot of the Glencairn drifting across the water as women in the foreground gyrate sensuously to an unseen music. The images are contrasted with those of Glencairn sailors looking pent-up and frustrated. Are the women really there on the shore, or just being imagined by the crew? It's a classic bit of expressionist ambiguity that, once established, carries through for the rest of the film.\n\nTake the case of Smitty, a fellow who no one can much figure out as he keeps to himself, at least until he is finally fingered as a likely German spy in a sequence that might appear contrived had not Nichols, Toland, and Hunter made it quite diabolically real. Ian Hunter is not a well-known actor today, but he carries the film as long as he's around, especially while confronted with his apparent treachery. Watching him grimace and shake with fury as his secret is slowly, gut-wrenchingly exposed is the strongest scene in this very strong film, and once the film moves beyond Smitty, it never quite recovers. Hunter also appears in \"Adventures Of Robin Hood\" as a similar figure of dual identities, and I won't make the mistake of underestimating him again.\n\nI only wish Thomas Mitchell, the Oscar winner from Ford's \"Stagecoach\" the previous year, had brought some restraint to his playing of Driscoll here. Barry Fitzgerald and John Qualen, Ford vets both, seem to catch his overacting bug. It's not pretty, especially to those of us who have seen all three give better work.\n\nWayne, however, is effective despite his dodgy accent, and it's interesting to see him in a film, just a year after his breakthrough in \"Stagecoach,\" where he is presented to us as one of the gang, something of a follower and not a lone-wolf leader. I don't normally associate Wayne with amiable go-alongness, but he carries it here.\n\nJohn Ford is pretty much the Shakespeare of cinema, effortlessly moving from comedy to tragedy within a single scene, and \"Long Voyage Home,\" while not perfect, makes a strong case for his visionary mastery.",

From Wuthering Heights (1939) to the Little Foxes, Ball of Fire, and Citizen Kane (all 1941), in three years, Toland lifted (again) the standards of the best Hollywood could do. This isn't just me saying this, and of course there are other great cinematographers, but if you've seen these movies you know they are exceptional. I falls right in the middle of this great stretch, and it has the revered John Ford directing, letting Toland do his thing, right from the first scene.\n\nThis is a solid, sometimes moving, sometimes dramatic movie, for sure. But the long first part is a composite of manly clich\u00e9s: drinking, fighting, and womanizing. It's all in good fun, in a way, and the exoticness is made to sell movies. But there's quite a lot of nothing going on beyond seducing native women in some unnamed distant land. The dancing and fighting are filmed with Toland perfection, but it turns quickly to farce, or stereotype.\n\nThomas Mitchell is a lively Irishman in his best form, and John Wayne is an improbable Swede, and doesn't stand out much from the bunch except toward the end, when he is a block of wood with a bad accent. The story is a series of misunderstandings and friendships, but since the plot is made of four different Eugene O'Neill plays (from 20 years earlier), there is a little discontinuity to it all.\n\nAll of this is set during that strange cusp between World War II beginning in Europe and the U.S. still not joining in. The ship is carrying ammunition, and hints of things that really matter are given right at the start, with some news reports crackling into the seeming isolation of the ship. As the captain says as they are to depart from New York with the military cargo, \"If it doesn't get there it'll be missed. But we won't.\"\n\nIsolationism gets a more famous treatment in Casablanca two years later, after the Americans are already at war, so in a way, a big name movie like this had more potential influence on American sentiment. It's fascinating to see this Walter Wanger/John Ford/John Wayne collaboration after their breakthrough Stagecoach the year before (producer, director, star).

This film's opening prologue states : \"With their hates and desires men are changing the face of the earth - but they cannot change the Sea . Men who live on the Sea never change - for they live in a lonely world apart as they drift from one rusty tramp steamer to the next, forging the life of Nations\" . The crew talk themselves and contend each other , but also save each other from bombing and risks .

However , it seems to be sometimes excessively sentimental and looks over-melodramatic during the reading letters from Smittys . The sailors show a nostalgic longing for past things and old values and their own homes : Sweden , Ireland , England . Straightforward acting by John Wayne as a Swedish sailor named Ole , he was to star habitually for Ford after the director rose his career from B Western in \u00a8Poverty Row\u00a8 productions , with his greatest hit , 'Stagecoach' .

Plays by writer Eugene O'Neil,screenwriter Dudley Nichols superbly never makes the various sources for the screenplay feel disjointed,but to instead smoothly join them,to create an unforgettable,down beat,brutal journey across the oceans.For the scenes before all of the crew start getting a sense of paranoia and dread,Nichols shows the ocean to have a vice like grip on the lives of everyone,with almost all of the conversations that the loyal gang have on the ship being about its day to day running,and some slightly shady activates taking place on the ships port.\n\nChecking up for trivia related to this marvellous film,I was extremely pleased to learn,that when talking about the movie to bio writer Maurice Zolotow,Wayne had said that: \"Usually it would be Ford who helped the cinematography get his compositions for maximum effect,but in this case it was Gregg Toland who helped ford.Voyage is about as beautifully photographed a movie as there has ever been.\"\n\nFrom the very first scene of the ship heading straight into the looming black clouds,Citizen Kane and The Westerner cinematography Gregg Toland creates one of the most dazzling and beautifully lit films that I have ever seen Fully displaying the brilliant deep focus style which he would expand upon in his next film,(Kane). \n\nToland uses the dept of field to build a tense, atmospheric feeling of isolation and paranoia,as the hope for the crew of reaching shore slowly deteriorates.Allowing the movie to fully soak in the Noir atmosphere,Toland expertly has high contrast lighting from outside the ships windows,be the only \"light\" to shine in the interior scenes,to show that despite a full crew,the SS Glencaim is ruled by shadows,fear and a haunting dread which will have a grip on the crew for the rest of their lives.",

And, wouldn't you know, the first hour of VOYAGE is devoted to Ford's Real Life buddy and Fascist henchman Ward Bond dying a slowly lingering death in great pain, as the Brit Captain withholds the ship's bottle of pain-killer until poor old Ward has given up his ghost. It's hard to imagine today that a flick with so much tedious padding could be nominated for the \"Best Picture\" Oscar (and this suggests a large Irish Bloc voting in lock-step year after year for Ford's fluff). The fact that Londoner Alfred Hitchcock's REBECCA trounced VOYAGE in the final tally underscores the fact that overly \"LONG\" is the operative word in the VOYAGE title. Anyone who has seen Barry Fitzgerald or John Wayne act in other movies will be amazed at how little Mr. Ford elicits from the pair here. If they gave out Oscars for \"Best Disappearing Act,\" one of these guys surely would have claimed it for VOYAGE.

                "text": "Maybe one of the reasons this is less successful than most of the other movies John Ford was directing about this time is that the other productions were so darned good. \"The Long Voyage Home\" isn't without interest but it doesn't measure up to the rest of Ford's work. Based on a couple of Eugene O'Neill's short plays, it gives us four patched-together stories: a drunken brawl aboard a small freighter in a Caribbean port, the death of a crew member (Yank, Ward Bond) and his funeral, the heroic redemption of Smitty the suspected spy, and the heroic struggle of a handful of inebriated men to get Ole (John Wayne) aboard a ship for home in the face of temptation.\n\nI haven't read that much of Eugene O'Neill's work and seen little of it performed but I get the impression his plays are, by necessity, largely literary works involving a kind of pointillism in which secrets and character traits are revealed little by little, mostly through dialog about psychology. \"Strange Interlude\" had characters breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience directly, explaining their REAL thoughts. This is hardly Ford territory.\n\nNot that Ford and O'Neill held each other in low esteem. They were two driven Irish-Americans and shared the occasional drunken crying jag. Dudley Nichols wrote the script and seems to have preserved the parts of the four stories that would most appeal to Ford -- funerals, comic fist fights, camaraderie, and booze. Ford directed it all with aplomb and to the extent that the stories hang together it's because we follow the same characters through all of them, so we get to know the men and their quirks.\n\nThe acting, alas, is not all it could be. Some of the more seasoned are fine -- Barry Fitzgerald, John Qualen, Thomas Mitchell, J. M. Kerrigan. But others --. John Wayne should never appear in a role requiring any kind of accent. He sounds about as Swedish as moo goo gai pan and he seems self-aware enough to be embarrassed about it. And Ward Bond should stick with his sidekick roles and never again assay a dramatic part. He's much better at imitating a whinnying horse than a dying and hallucinating sailor. Ian Hunter as Smitty, the suspected spy, is not bad in an important role -- just bland. The scene in which his shipmates find a stack of letters supposed to be in code and read them aloud, only to realize that they are love letters from his wife, must have been borrowed and revamped for \"Destination Tokyo\".\n\nThat pretty much gets any weaknesses out of the way. James Basevi's set decoration is splendid and Gregg Toland's photography can't be beat for indirect lighting and long shadows on wet decks and cobblestone streets. Ford handles the direction as well as he ever has, which is to say with efficiency and sometimes even poetry. Still, overall, it's a gloomy film with little comedy and Ford probably had trouble with the simple fact that these sailors actually hate the vocation they're hopelessly bound to. None has a family. None has any aspirations beyond further drudgery leading to the next paycheck. And the loyalty they feel is only to their mates, not to their calling.\n\nWorth seeing if only for the great visuals.",

I found little interesting in this. Aside from the story of men at sea who dream of home there didn't really seem to be much to this.

The main role went to Thomas Mitchell, fresh from his Oscar-winning role in the Ford/Wayne classic STAGECOACH and before his most memorable role as Uncle Billy in the timeless masterpiece IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

John Wayne stars in this film as Ole, a Swedish sailor who has not seen his family in over 10 years. It was interesting seeing John Wayne in a movie where he is not a cowboy because that's what he is mostly know for. The festivities began when a group of Spanish women board the ship and bring fruit and smuggle rum for the sailors. This showed how lonely these sailors became while on board for such an extended period of time. The mood of the movie did change a few times. It changed once when the Spanish girls came on board and again when they finally reached land and were able to get drunk. The sailors began acting crazy and got drunk very quickly. The Spanish girls started resisting them and soon a riot broke out. Sailors began hitting each other and one sailor even took a broken rum bottle and stabbed a fellow sailor. You can easily tell how bored sailors become because of how they acted when the Spanish girls cam on board. The officers caught the Spanish girls bringing rum on the ship and did not pay them. The music plays a big role in setting the mood in the movie. The music has a lot of string instruments to give it a lonely slow paced feeling. When guys look out at sea, the music is slow and fairly depressing. One quote that caught my attention was when a sailor said, \"When a man goes out to sea, he should give up thinking about shore\u0085Land don't want him no more.\" To me I think he was saying that there is no point feeling sad about not being able to be on land because there is nothing you can do to change where you are. Each sailor who survived had to wait just as long as the next man to reach land. This movie exhibits how life as a sailor could change. Two sailors, Smitty and Yank died while on board of Glencairn and Drisk died at the end when he was aboard Amindra and it got torpedoed. You feel bad for the lives they live because they go through the same routine for such a long time and they see the same people everyday without seeing their loved ones. To me, it would become really frustrating because I would get frustrated doing the same things and seeing the same people. The sailors show their boredom by looking for conflict. They have suspicion that Smitty is a spy and search through his belongings and tie him up. He was falsely accused after Drisk reads the letters he received and realizes he was wrong the entire time. Soon after a storm hits and kills Yank, an air attack takes the life of Smitty. It was strange how he died because he was on a row boat hanging on the side of the ship, and when he got shot, the tarp just covered him and nobody really knew when he died. During the air attack, the fighter planes dropped bombs that didn't hit the ship, but the machine guns did and took the life of Smitty. The way he dies all by himself was similar to the lonely feelings the sailors often felt. Ole, the Swedish sailor also expresses his loneliness when they arrive on land and he tells the woman at the bar about how he hasn't seen his family in almost 10 years. He was the only one out of the crew members that was going to board the Amindra ship. His drunk shipmates pulled him off the ship before it left, but again one man was left out of their crew after he was knocked unconscious. A sailor at the end of the movie read a headline in the newspaper that read \"AMINDRA TORPEDOED\" and so it ended another lonesome sailor died.",

Michael O'Shea brings some energy to the role, and in general it conveys some of the basic characteristics of its subject's life reasonably well. The last part of it was heavily tailored to the time in which it was filmed, and unfortunately it is now only of interest as an example of how badly a movie can become dated when it tries to do that.\n\nMost of the movie is a collection of distinct experiences in London's life, tied loosely together. It works all right, and it effectively conveys the irregular nature of his lifestyle, with some courageous acts being mixed in with his involvement in disreputable and even illegal activities. The low budget nature of the production occasionally keeps some of these sequences from being more effective, but it's not bad, though it would have benefited from giving Susan Hayward and some of the other supporting cast members a little more to do.\n\nIn the last half hour or so, the story shifts its focus to a lengthy sequence that has London in Japan, reporting on the war between Japan and Russia in the early 20th century. The overt and sometimes forced condemnations of Japan make the sequence now look labored and a bit frantic, though in its time the message may have seemed to be appropriate.\n\nThere was surely a middle ground that would have allowed for brief wartime message to be inserted without getting things completely off-track. Many movies of the first half of the 1940s, in fact, do just that, and are able to hold up perfectly well today even when there are a handful of scenes or quotes that were clearly intended to have wartime significance. Jack London was a fine writer and an interesting person, but this movie ends up taking the focus too far away from him and from his life.",

Jack's adventures; Alaska gold rush, educational advances, etc. are somewhat documented, but not as well as I would have liked. The script dwells on the Japanese treatment of Jack London and Russian prisoners prior to WWI. There's true information on London there, but it could be more accurate. Much of it is weak and doesn't include his political stands.\n\nSince this movie was scripted and filmed in 1943 (mid-WWII), we need to know it was a quickly made WWII film that showed what was going on during a before WWI time. I saw it referred to as 'Japanese bashing' but we must remember we were at war and the Japanese were using their own forms of propaganda for 'America bashing'; remember their famous cartoons and 'Tokyo Rose'. Whether we agree or disagree it is in the past.\n\nAnd the director, Alfred Santell, and writers, Charmian London(book) and Isaac Don Levine(script) put together a movie that they hoped reflected the spirit of \"Jack London\".\n\nMichael O'Shea (born: 1906) did a great job of portraying the part of Jack. He did 19 more movies and several TV roles passing away in 1973 of a heart attack.\n\nBut a true visual treat was seeing Susan Hayward in the role of Charmian Kittredge London. She added beauty and a fiery loyalty to Michael's temperamental Jack.\n\nSusan (born: 1918) died in 1975 of brain cancer. Susan was a great actress and you can't help but wonder what she would have contributed to the movie world had she been able to continue on.",

                "text": "Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him. Sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character.\n\nJack London who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote on what he knew, but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him. Some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism. But this was World War II and London was a big believer in the 'yellow peril' as it was called back in the day.\n\nTwo thirds of the film covers his life as author, we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for The Sea Wolf. We see him up in the Yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since.\n\nThe final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the Russo-Japanese War. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not encompass folks who were Oriental. Like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people. He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals.\n\nThe film puts the cart before the horse. London is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the Russo-Japanese War what Japan's ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was. Actually the kind of atrocities present in World War II were not existent during the Russo-Japanese conflict. Japan had her imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else including the USA at that time. But our immigration policies caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with Japan over a couple of generations. London was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness.\n\nThis film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than Jack London. Had he a bit more money Bronston might have gotten James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both who would have been right for the role. Instead they got Michael O'Shea who was making his second film after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is fine in the part, but certainly was no box office.\n\nAs London is covering the war, he meets up with a Captain Tanaka who is played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specialized in Orientals and played a ton of them in World War II. From the vantage point in 1905 Strong outlines in the best Fu Manchu tradition Japan's imperial aims right up to taking on the USA eventually. Must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd. \n\nA lot of course is left out of London's life including a first wife. Playing the second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward who only comes into the movie when it's half over. I wish we'd have seen more of her. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955.\n\nO'Shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973.\n\nMaybe one day we'll get a view of Jack London that will be a lot better than this one.",

This 90-minute film, purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized, doesn't even scratch the surface, and remains a story very ripe for a modern-day retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. He is not the problem here. Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the \"basis\" for this film. London's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes, which the film skips lightly through. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War...colorful events, for sure, but hardly given anything like in-depth treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he also directed one of Susan's first films, \"Our Leading Citizen,\" in 1939) is lackadaisical at best. Making things rougher here is a very poor-quality DVD, with a crummy-looking print source and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the DVD's extras: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Let's just hope that these films are in better shape than \"Jack London\"!",

Also, it's a shame more time is not given to the rigors of the Yukon, the real basis of London's powerful prose. I wouldn't be surprised that budget constraints cramped this key phase of his life. Too bad, because London was an outdoor writer who wrote powerfully about the outdoors\u0097something you don't get from the movie.\n\nOne scene, I think, is worth noting. That's where Prof. Hilliard ridicules student London's uncompromising literary realism. Though the screenplay doesn't elaborate, there's a background assumption to Hilliard's point of view. Namely, that American literature is dominated by the standards of its gentile, well-to-do class with refined tastes and the leisure time to both read and write. Thus, London's raw depiction of life at the bottom comes across as offensive for a number of reasons. It's that impossible leap from the immiserated bottom to the refined top that London's trying to navigate. But more importantly, he's doing it without compromising the integrity of his work.\n\nNow, the screenplay softens this conflict by casting the kindly Davenport as the professor and having him pay tribute to London's \"courage\" as a budding writer. As a result, hostility to the upsurge of blue-collar writing that London represents is seriously underplayed. Perhaps that's not surprising. After all, WWII was a great national effort where class differences were submerged to the common interest. \n\nO'Shea and Hayward are fine in their roles. However, I agree that a more honest depiction of the great writer's life awaits production. Given the richness of the material, I wonder why that hasn't happened.",

                "text": "Jack London is one of my favourite writers and the life he lived was so large - his books seemed almost small in comparison. \"Jack London\" was based on the book \"The Book of Jack London\" by Charmian Kittredge, his second wife. She had a thirst for adventure almost as strong as Jack's, so she was not going to dwell too much on his younger days. His first wife is not mentioned in this movie, she was older than him, they had 2 children together and she really encouraged him to pursue his education and writing. But they were very mismatched and he eventually left her to pursue his own interests.\n\nThe film begins with Jack's (Michael O'Shea, who looked rather like him) time as an oyster pirate (he was only a teenager when he became one in real life). His best friend, Scratch Nelson, (you can barely make out Regis Toomey) is killed by the Fish Patrol and that event causes Jack to sail out on a sealing schooner for the Bering Sea. The trip is long and harsh (again, in real life, Jack wrote the book \"The Sea Wolf\" based on some of the characters). After the voyage he enrols at the University of California where his tutor (Henry Davenport) sees greatness and courage in his rough stories. Jack then decides to go to the Yukon and while there he begins to write stories about the miners and the girls who live in the camps. While in pursuit of a gold strike he finds himself snowed in with a dog and writes the book that made him famous - \"The Call of the Wild\" (in real life Jack London believed Huskies made wonderful pets and helped make the breed popular.)\n\nHe returned to America to great acclaim and his life became more meaningful when he met his soul mate Charmian Kittredge (Susan Hayward). She has already fallen in love with him through his books but is afraid she will be disappointed in him as a man. After that small scene, Hayward definitely takes a back seat to his adventures - not at all the way it was in reality. He is asked to cover the Boer War with a London newspaper - even though he has never done any reporting before (again, in real life Jack, who was very passionate about reporting, covered an assignment about poverty in London's East End).\n\nI agree, after the first hour the film quickly descended into a message of propaganda (according to this movie, even back in the early 1900s Japan wanted world domination). The real Jack London deserved much more than this - he did much more. He and Charmian had their own boat and they intended to sail around the world. He explored Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands and he introduced surfing to California. He covered the San Francisco earthquake and was on one of the last boats out of the harbour. He also introduced organic farming. It is unfortunate that so much time in the film is given over to the Russian Japanese War of 1905 - there is hardly any mention given to his many books.\n\nLouise Beavers had an excellent part as Mammy Jenny, the only mother that Jack really knew. Her best scenes were early in the movie and she gave her part real feeling but by the end she just seemed to be in the background as a family retainer. Beautiful Virginia Mayo had a small but attention getting part as Maimie, the oyster pirate girl. Osa Massen was Freda, the dance hall girl he met in Alaska.",

The writer and director have taken a remarkable man whose life went from the pits through triumph to tragedy and turned it into a moral tale that belongs in a comic book of the period.\n\nI was a fan of Jack London as a high school kid -- loved his short stories about adventure and adverse circumstances. Later I was able to view his work from a more mature and generous perspective. He wasn't a great writer but he put out some gripping stuff based on his own experiences. \"The Sea Wolf,\" which is barely alluded to in the movie, is a fine work, at least until we get into that plummy romance. Anyone familiar with the San Francisco Bay area should read the opening, in which \"Hump\" takes a ferry from the city to Sausalito and is rammed in the fog by another ship. It's flawless description. The circumstances are so aptly rendered that it could happen the same way tomorrow.\n\nOkay. So here's Jack London up in the Yukon during the gold rush. That's the source of stories like \"The Call of the Wild\" and \"To Build a Fire.\" And what do we get? Five minutes of Michael O'Shea in a small log cabin, alone except for a dog, looking out the window at the snow and having a conversation about his work with the dog, Buck, who gives a fine performance, by the way.\n\nThe editing is terrible. It's not a flaw or a virtue that brings attention to itself very often. But I couldn't tell whether O'Shea was married to Susan Hayward, just visiting, or shacking up with her. London becomes an \"oyster pirate.\" What is an oyster pirate? Another episode begins with talk of war breaking out and London receives an offer to go to Japan as a correspondent. WHAT war? Who is going to war with whom? Is it World War I? If so, why is London going to Tokyo? The words \"Russo-Japanese War\" (1905) are never mentioned.\n\nThat war itself takes up about the last third of the movie and it's curiously rendered. The movie was released in 1943. The Japanese are all smiles, bows, torture, and treachery. They open the conflict by attacking the Russians at Port Arthur without warning \"to get, how do you say in your country, the first punch?\" London replies: \"You mean a sucker punch.\" (Kids, that's a reference to the Japanese attack on the US bases at Pearl Harbor in 1941, that led to World War II. PS: We won.) The Japanese massacre pitiful Russian prisoners who are dying of thirst, and they explain to London exactly how they plan to go about conquering the world, including the US and Britain, when the time comes.\n\nIn 1963, a big-budget movie called \"55 Days at Peking\" was released. It was about the Boxer Rebellion in China, which took place 5 years before the Russo-Japanese War. In \"55 Days at Peking\", the Japanese are our allies, the Russians are shifty, and the Chinese are enemies. Politics makes strange bedfellows.\n\nAs London, Michael O'Shea is likable without being a particularly impressive actor. He has a fresh, open face that looks like the map of Ireland. His family were all Irish cops in Hartford. Virginia Mayo is his first girl friend. He goes through one or two more, just in case the audience has any doubt about his gender orientation, until he meets Charmiane, the love of his life, upon whose book this movie is based.\n\nI don't think I'll go on. In life, Jack London did begin his go-to-hell life as an oyster pirate -- robbing the bivalves at night from oyster beds belonging to someone else. He was a union man and socialist, an imprisoned vagrant, a sailor. He did go to the Yukon and did become a famous writer. He was one of the first to establish an artist's colony in Carmel, California, on Monterey Bay. Then he got into heroin and booze and retreated to a ranch in what is now wine country, where he died in 1916.",

We are informed that what makes London such a patriot is the apparent revelation by a Japanese host that Japan has a master plan of conquest because they do not have an empire and cannot survive on trade.\n\nTruth told, especially during the depicted Russo-Japanese War, is that all the great powers had the same attitude. And London probably owes his survival to Teddy Roosevelt's negotiation of the peace (only TR's anger over London is shown).\n\nLondon was also a white supremacist and anti semite,whose obsession with adventure sounds like misanthropy. If analogized to his similar contemporary Rudyard Kipling, we might have seen the characterization of a dashing poet, ironist, and visionary of human nature, and not a Bowery Boy. Some poetry does seem evident in the script at the very end.\n\nO'Shea struggles mightily as the lead, but he is no Spencer Tracy and has none of the Irish charm or humorous physicality.

It purports to be a film about the life of London, but frankly it bears about as much similarity to his life as it does Foghorn Leghorn's or Lassie's! Plus, the real reason for this film is a thinly disguised anti-Japanese rant.\n\nAs far as London's life goes, aside from a few sketchy details, most of his life is unrecognizable in the film. In real life, he was married twice, ran about with prostitutes and died quite young--none of which are even alluded to in the film! Instead, it mostly fictionalizes his life up until he became a war correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War (shortly after the turn of the century). And, while London was really a correspondent at that time, the film is basically an anti-Japanese picture--taking the worst of London's experiences and adding a lot of 'we will one day rule the world' thrown in to boot. Now I DO understand why this was done--after all, the Japanese and US were fighting a war against each other in 1943. And, it was true that there were militaristic forces that felt exactly like the characters in the film--but the film was about 1903-1904--not 1943. And so, to make the Japanese look terrible, the film took many liberties. This is funny, as during the actual Russo-Japanese War, American sentiments were mostly pro-Japanese! The bottom line is that the film makers should have either made a real biography of London or they should have made an anti-Japanese propaganda film. Propaganda films have a positive place if done correctly and reasonably accurately (this IS possible and the US made many such films during the war). Because the film tries to be both, it does a terrible job of both--and completely sanitizes and obscures London's real life exploits (which WOULD make for a fascinating film) and comes off as preachy and fake. Bad propaganda and even worse history--even O'Shea's good acting and the presence of a young Susan Hayward could do nothing to overcome a crap script.\n\nBy the way, if you'd like to see a Japanese movie about a real life person that is filled with anti-American propaganda due to it being made during WWII, try watching Akira Kurosawa's film from his Judo series--\"Sanshiro Sugata Part Two\". While the film was set during the 1800s, an evil American was randomly thrown into the film to get beaten up by the hero of the story and to bolster anti-American sentiments in the audience! It manages to be even more superficial than \"Jack London\" in this regard.",

About 75 min. into the movie the script follows a Japanese military officer describing a haunting plan for his country to take charge to rule of all the world. It would be a step at a time, involving china, etc. and finally the USA. he states that it may take \" a hundred years, but it will be done\".\n\nWell, it hasn't been carried out as they had it down. But it seems to becoming as such, as they are buying and moving into America more as time progresses. It's eerie this movie made in 1943 predicted this similar outcome!!",

Okay, the plot is not exactly original, but sidekick Fuzzy Jones, of all people, has a couple of clever tricks up his sleeve. Note that it's Fuzzy who gets the most screen time. I'm estimating that black-clad hero Lash is in only about one in four scenes, and I'm wondering why so few. His acting skills appear good enough. And he can certainly ride and throw punches with the best of the matin\u00e9e heroes of the day. Plus, there's that trademark lash of the whip. But the odd fact is that Fuzzy alone carries much of the plot.

Evil land baron Big Jim Kirby (George Chesebro) knows the railroad is coming through, so he intends on having all the local rancher mortgages called in to buy them out. There's also the water rights issue thrown into the bargain, so the story is kind of a twofer. Rancher Tom Grant (Buster Slaven) sends for the Cheyenne Kid, who arrives on the scene to team up with Fuzzy Q. Jones (Fuzzy St. John) to smoke out the bad guys.\n\nFuzzy's got a fair amount of screen time in this one, and he has a couple of gimmicks going. He gets his head stuck in things when he gets into a fight, (a box, a chair), and about mid-way through, falls off his horse, knocking his head and developing amnesia. The latter happens right after he's picked up a thirty three thousand dollar bundle the ranchers put together to get their deeds up to date. You would think the conk on the noggin would make him even more addle brained, but the effect seems to be just the opposite. It calms him down and he winds up almost sensible.\n\nNot to worry. One of the baddies cold cocks Fuzzy, and he winds up back where he started, even remembering that he actually had the smarts to replace the original money stash with bits of paper and pebbles. That was in case he got rolled on the way into town. Which he did. All so predictable, but I did have to wonder why none of the ranchers ever got seriously concerned about the missing money.\n\nThat's because the Cheyenne Kid was on the case. Black clad gunman Lash Larue used a gimmick of his own, a bull whip with a bull's eye that he often used to good advantage. Larue's character in these oaters for PRC and Eagle Lion usually went by Marshal Cheyenne Davis, often going under cover as The Cheyenne Kid. In this one, I don't believe I heard any reference to his being a marshal.",

I remember how terribly sad I and many relatives were when the death of La Jana was announced in late 1940. I recently read that La Jana was selected for the part of LolaLola in Blau Engel but that Sternberg's wife who was a friend of Dietrich managed to give the part to Dietrich, thus changing cinematic history.

French native speakers may want to take a look a the French version with different actors that came out at the very same time. It's basically one part of a two-film series. The other is called \"Der Tiger von Eschnapur\". \"Das indische Grabmal\" is actually a remake from 1921 and 20 years later, they made another version. The film's director is Richard Eichberg. He directed almost 90 films since 1915 (including some of the movies I just mentioned) and this is almost his last effort even if he lived on for quite a while. He made one more 10 years later and he also wrote this movie here, which was a bit unusual for him. Maybe that's why he had two co-writers. The most famous name here is probably Thea von Harbou. She came up with the scripts for \"M\" and \"Metropolis\" and \"Das indische Grabmal\" is also based on her work. Or maybe the biggest name is also Theo Lingen, one of Germany's most known actors of the 20th century. This film is over 75 years old and runs for almost 90 minutes, there is lots of intrigue and drama, but also quite some music and dance and a despicable elephant fighting sequence. I liked lead actress Kitty Jantzen's performance and I am a bit surprised to see that she did not really act a lot back then. Maybe she was in here, because she was the significant other to director Eichberg. Anyway, all in all, especially in terms of the story I hoped for more here. I cannot really recommend this film and I hope \"Der Tiger von Eschnapur\" will be better. I am gonna give this one watch soon as well, so make sure to check out my review for that one too.",

But he does let his father use his influence to get him a job in the police radio room where at a propitious moment the radios go bad when a gang Cabot is working with pull a large payroll holdup where a cop is killed.\n\nGlenn Ford plays a friend from the neighborhood and rival to Cabot for Julie Bishop. Later on Cabot kills Glenn Ford's mother when she recognizes the fugitive. \n\nThe idea of any police department employing Cabot with a rapsheet in a police command center really boggles the mind. I was speechless at the mere concept.\n\nMy Son Is Guilty was also the first time that Glenn Ford worked with Edgar Buchanan whom he became great friends with and always tried to use in his films. Buchanan plays a bartender here.\n\nBest performance in the film is that of Wynne Gibson as the widow of the former head of the gang Cabot works with and she's tough, smart, and beautiful. Too bad her performance was wasted in this film.\n\nGlenn Ford made his feature film debut in Heaven With A Barbed Wire Fence the same year for 20th Century Fox. But Darryl Zanuck passed on signing him so Ford got a contract with Columbia. He'd have to work his way up in quality of pictures so My Son Is Guilty would be the start of quite a climb.",

As a movie, it's great fun, with a cast much too sophisticated for both the plot and the script. In effect, the acting skill of both Karloff and Peter Lorre (as Dr Lorenz) are the film's salvation.

Its basically a minor horror/comedy played out more or less like a Three Stooges comedy with a budget. For stars Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre, it was probably a welcome change of pace from the roles both had been playing. The story is similar in many ways to \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" a hit Broadway play of the day in which Karloff had been starring.\n\nTwo eccentrics, Professor Nathaniel Billings (Karloff) and Amelia Jones (Maude Eburne) live in a run down old Colonial Inn which they have put up for sale. A young lady Winnie Layden (Jeff Donnell) comes to look over the place and decides to buy it. As a condition of the sale Billings asks that he, Amelia and handyman Ebenezer (George McKay) be allowed to stay so that Billings can complete his experiments in the building's basement.\n\nThe mortgage holder Dr. Lorentz (Lorre), who is also the sheriff, the coroner and the Justice of the Peace, among other titles, arrives. Billings gleefully pays off his mortgage and Winnie takes title to the property just as her former husband Bill (Larry Parks) arrives to try for some unknown reason to prevent her from buying the Inn.\n\nMeanwhile Billings continues his experiments to try to perfect a super human, but his test subject apparently dies. Bill discovers the body in the basement and he and Winnie report the crime to Lorenz in his role of the town sheriff. On investigating, Lorenz learns of Billings plans and wants in on the action. He also discovers that there are also four other \"test subjects\" laid out in the next room.\n\nA \"ballet master\", J. Gilbert Brampton arrives at the Inn and begins to snoop around. A traveling powder puff salesman (Maxie Rosenbloom) arrives and Billings and Lorentz plan to make him their next \"test subject\". An escaped fascist prisoner (Frank Paglia) also drops in and threatens to blow everybody up. Two cops (Frank Sully, James Morton) arrive to investigate a reported murder.\n\nEverything manages to get sorted out in the end.\n\nThe film leaves a few unanswered questions such as \"Where did Winnie get all of the cash?, Why were Bill and Winnie divorced?, Who was really making the Indian whooping noise? and What was the \"arrangement\", if any between Billings and Amelia? And beware of the typical Hollywood Production Code ending. This was Karloff's final film on his Columbia contract and he would be off the screen until 1944's \"The Climax\" while he continued to appear in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", which by the way prevented him from getting a part in the 1944 film version.\n\nThe two leads seem to enjoy all of this nonsense and both would appear in comedic parts over the years for the rest of their careers.",

Peter Lorre finds out what is going on, and tells the prof \"And to think, I accused you of conducting hair brained experiments!\" (paraphrase)Other lines are equally as understatedly funny: Lorre who plays a mayor/doctor/scientist/marriage celebrant/sheriff/loan shark etc etc etc is asked \"Doesn't anyone else do anything around here?\" \"Oh\" replies Lorre, \"they just vote once a year\". This really is a funny movie. All that's missing is Vincent Price and a handsome Hungarian in a vampire cape. \n\nThat said, it's distinctive wackiness means it's for people who like that sort of thing. I found plenty to laugh and lots to enjoy, I'd recommend this anyone. Peter Lorre is especially good.",

Monster, mummy, mandarin, or daffy doctor, Karloff always seemed truly puzzled and not a little grieved at the mayhem and horror that swirled around him in every film.  In Boogie Man he is simply trying to support the War effort with a little harmless electricity. His slight lisp, and polite British accent, gave his utterances a benign tone.  Even his evil grimace (and only Lugosi could match those melodramatic facial convulsions) somehow seem less menacing than mildly complaining, as if he were telling you about a pesky toothache.  In this film he's playing for laughs, of course, but even in his starkest horror roles you can sense just a touch of amusement at himself as he chews up the scenery (or a victim.)

Imagine my surprise, then, when instead of the typical horror film it turned out this was supposed to be a screwball comedy. I say \"supposed to\" because the film just wasn't funny.\n\nThe film takes place in a rotting old Colonial home that's being turned into an inn. The lady who just bought the place knows nothing about running a hotel and she agreed to let the old owner (Karloff) continue to live there and conduct his experiments in the basement. However, she does not know that the experiments have already killed four traveling salesmen and Karloff doesn't seem particularly alarmed about this. Later, the town's big-shot (Peter Lorre) finds out about it but instead of arresting him (since he's, among other things, the sheriff), he quickly goes into business with Karloff. Then, unexpectedly, other people start to die and disappear and all sorts of kookiness ensues.\n\nIn so many, many ways this film is a bad knockoff of ARSENIC AND OLD LACE--which had been a very successful play for several years and was wonderfully filmed in late 1941 (though shelved until the play ended in 1944). In fact, both Karloff and Lorre were associated with the production (Lorre was in the film and Karloff was in the Broadway play). In many other ways THE BOOGIE MAN is a blatant ripoff of ARSENIC AND OLD LACE--such as the dead bodies in the basement, the disappearing body, Lorre being a doctor (in addition to being a sheriff and several other jobs), etc.. The big difference, however, is that THE BOOGIE MAN is totally unfunny from start to finish due to having absolutely no pacing or decent writing. Instead of subtle or clever (like ARSENIC), the film just comes off as very abrasive and loud and more like a Three Stooges film than anything else. Considering it was made by Columbia Pictures (home of the Stooges), this isn't all that surprising. What is surprising is that Karloff would allow himself to be in such a dreadful film. In fact, I might go so far as to say that this is possible Karloff's worst film of the 1940s--though a few of his later films are significantly worse (if that's possible), such as GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI and CAULDRON OF BLOOD.\n\nWatch only if you have a very strong stomach and a very, very low sense of humor. If you like the Stooges' shorts, this film might still not be sophisticated enough for you as the average Stooge short is like Shakespeare compared to THE BOOGIE MAN. Wow that's one hour of my life I'll never be able to get back--thanks Columbia!",

James, diagnostic intern at \"Blair General Hospital\" finds he has a rival for Mary's affections in brain surgeon Gregory Lane (Shepperd Strudwick), whose losing streak of dying surgical subjects brings out the compassionate best from the eponymous hero who, clandestinely with Mary's aid, applies the sticky method of insulin shock (accepted at the time of filming as valid) to a Lane patient in order to correct his condition of dementia, possibly caused by Lane's procedure, while at the same time hoping to save the surgeon's waning reputation.  The film was successful upon its release due to audience perception that a graphic depiction of the sanctum within a major hospital is being revealed; it benefits from splendid cinematography of John Seitz, and also the familiar sterling cast of the series including those mentioned as well as Frank Orth, Nat Pendleton and Samuel Hinds as the senior Kildare, in addition to a raft of other performing stalwarts.",

In the MGM serial, Dr. Kildare was called Jimmy by his nurse girlfriend (later his wife) Mary Lamont, played by lovely Laraine Day. His boss, Dr. Gillespie, was played by Lionel Barrymore.\n\nIn this entry into the series, Kildare attempts to save the reputation of a neurosurgeon (Sheppard Strudwick) who has had a streak of bad luck, i.e., his patients have died. When a patient makes it through surgery but appears to have become demented, Kildare administers insulin shock therapy, an accepted form of treatment until the 1950s to treat psychotic disorders. The treatment put the patient into a coma and upon awakening, saline was given as well as glucose to terminate the treatment. Insulin shock therapy had some efficacy in schizophrenia that was of less than 2 year duration. Kildare's explanation of how it worked and what it treated deviated somewhat from the above description.\n\nThe subplot is Kildare's hesitance to ask Mary to marry him because it would entail waiting awhile, and his competition for her affections from the aforementioned doctor.\n\nBarrymore as Gillespie seems a lot more irascible around Kildare than he did when the series revolved around him later on. Lew Ayres created a huge hoopla when he became a conscientious objector during World War II, and MGM got rid of the Kildare character; theaters were refusing to show Ayres' films. Ayres did serve in the military as a medic on the front lines and resumed his career, winning an Oscar nomination for \"Johnny Belinda.\" He worked almost until his death in 1996. But post-war, he only played Dr. Kildare on the radio in the early '50s.\n\nThe very likable and excellent cast elevates the series, and this is one of the better Kildare films.",

After Lane's most recent patient awakens from surgery a raving lunatic, Kildare has to prove this wasn't Lane's fault. Lane also happens to be Kildare's romantic rival for Nurse Mary Lamont (Laraine Day). Lamont's in love with Kildare but he doesn't want to get married on his small salary. Yeah, it's one of those \"make him jealous so he'll marry me before someone else does\" plots that were the go-to formula for how women should snag men in old movies and TV shows. At least in this case Kildare isn't made to look like a total schmuck.\n\nDespite the so-so romance stuff, the meat of the story is the medical case. As with most of the Kildare films, the medical knowledge is dated and easy to knock today. You'll notice with these films a lot of reviewers do just that. Personally I think that's unfair and kind of petty. Hold the films to the standards of their day, not ours. Anyway, the series regulars are all enjoyable, as usual. The story isn't the strongest but it's never dull and keeps your interest throughout. Favorite part? The early scene where Dr. Gillespie reads the riot act to some oldster that's in love with a girl in her twenties. Hilarious. Medical ethics aside, these bits of business are some of my favorite parts of the Kildare & Gillespie films.

If it were not for him, I doubt this series would have been as popular as it was. I believe this is number four in the series, and by this time Dr. Kildare and nurse Mary Lamont are in love, but Dr. Kildare only makes twenty dollars a month as an intern, so he doesn't feel like he can support a wife. Thus he has made no promises to Mary. Remember, back in these days (1940) women always quit their jobs when they got married. Thus Mary has started dating a young brain surgeon, who also has happened to lose a lot of patients lately. He finally gets suspended from the hospital when the last of his patients has gone insane seemingly as a result of the surgery he has performed.\n\nAt this point Dr. Kildare takes up the case of proving that the patient is not insane as a result of the surgery by jolting him back to sanity via insulin shock therapy. This primitive method that was long a mainstream treatment for mental patients involves injecting someone with a large dose of insulin and then sitting back and seeing what develops. As a diabetic I can tell you what develops, sweating followed by seizures, possibly followed by death or coma. However, the medical profession, which had a primitive understanding of diabetes and insulin seventy years ago, thinks that what happens is that the human brain regresses back to its primitive self, then back to its evolved present and that the patient's sanity is sometimes restored in the process. This is how Dr. Kildare explains it in the film and it is both hilarious and somewhat shocking.\n\nThere are some other jaw-droppers such as after long hours in surgery when all the doctors and nurses involved light up a cigarette - in the hospital, still in their surgical gowns. Note that there is no such thing as biomedical monitoring equipment - nurses just come by each patient and \"look in on them\". There are a few things that are better in 1940 than today. For one, Dr. Gillespie isn't afraid to hand out straight talk to patients about their culpability involving their conditions. Today doctors are afraid to mention that an overweight patient might lose a little weight and improve their situation because they are so fearful of lawsuits.",

The handsome and rich, compared to the struggling and $20,00 a month intern, Dr.Lane is in danger of sweeping Nurse Lamont off her feet and away from idealistic and not money hungry Dr. Kildare.\n\nAs things turn out in the movie \"Doctor Kildare's Strange Case\" the sure of himself and optimistic, in his brain surgery, Dr. Lane goes into a deep slump with a string of failures on the operating table ending with his latest patient Mr. Grayson, Donald Douglas,never regaining consciousness and dying after Dr. Lane operated on him.\n\nYou would think that Dr. Kildare would be happy that his rival for Nurse Lamont's affections was screwing up and let him, by just standing on the sidelines, end up being kicked out of the Blair General for his incompetence but the opposite just happens. Being the unselfish person that he is Dr. Kildare in fact saves Dr. Lane's a** and reputation. This happens when the young doctor comes to Dr. Lane's rescue in helping revive, from losing his mind, a spaced out man,John Eldredge, who was hit by a car as he was walking down the street dressed only in an overcoat and pajamas.\n\nInsisting that Dr. Lane work on the homeless man, in order to get his confidence as a brain surgeon back, Dr. Kildare in effect had the by now confused brain surgeon short a fuse in the man's skull that left him alive but totally insane. Deprssed over what he did in having Dr. Lane operate on the homeless man Dr. Kildare came to the conclusion that the man was insane already before he was operated on. The man kept mumbling over and over again before and after the operation Friday! Friday! Not Monday Monday or Tuesday Wednesday!\n\nUsing this new technique, invented by Polish physician Manfred Sakel in 1933, called insulin therapy Dr. Kildare together with Nurse Lamont planned to shock the homeless man, who turned out to be a Mr.Henry Adams, back into sanity by flooding his both brain and body with high douses of insulin. If it worked great for everyone involved including the clueless, to what Dr. Kildare and Nurse Lamont were doing, Dr. Lane. If it didn't it would not only mean losing their, Dr, Kildare and Nurse Lamont, jobs but spending a stretch in the state penitentiary for manslaughter.\n\nVery technical and sometimes way over the heads of it's audience \"Doctor Kildare's Strange Case\" was truly strange.

That was Kildare (Lew Ayres) convincing Dr. Gregory Lane (Shepperd Strudwick) to perform risky brain surgery on a man after the good doctor has had a string of operating room mishaps where his patients have died. Seems to me this would have been a far fetched plot even in 1940, but hey, I'm no doctor.\n\nNow I'd never heard about insulin injections as a specific therapy for psychiatric disorders, so when I heard Kildare's explanation of how it would bring patient Adams' brain function back to the very earliest stage of evolution, I thought I was watching some Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi sci-fi/horror flick minus the Frankenstein laboratory. This sounded totally convoluted and made up to me, but apparently there was some science to this back in the day. Only goes to show you that sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, even if it turns out to be fiction.\n\nBut apart from all that, I thought this was a pretty entertaining flick. Growing up I never had an allure for TV medical dramas, so even though I was around for Richard Chamberlain's take on the title character, I never watched the show. I probably missed something there, but there's no reason I can't look up some of those episodes. Fortunately for Dr. Kildare in this story, his diagnosis proved to be correct, otherwise it could have been a short series. Lew Ayres was OK here as the medical hero, but Lionel Barrymore was the best as his cantankerous old supervisor. Laraine Day was also a pleasant addition to the cast as Kildare's romantic lead, but I didn't really get the chemistry there. Maybe it's just me.\n\nBest line of the film - \"The operation was a success but the patient died.\" I'm still thinking about that one.",

In seeking to help save Sheppard Strudwick's reputation as a neurosurgeon, Ayres performs a completely reckless act without official authorization to prove a point.\n\nAyres does all this mind you even with the fact that Strudwick who is at the top of his field and pulling down big bucks to add to the big bucks he inherited is making moves on nurse Laraine Day with whom Ayres has a running romance with in the series. Ayres on the other hand is surviving on the meager pay of an intern. But this was the days of the Code and doctors were almost always portrayed as saints.\n\nStrudwick in the film is having a crisis of confidence and rumors that he's losing his touch are spreading. He's lost several patients, not his fault because brain surgery is always risky. Still with Ayres assistance he's operating on John Eldredge who was brought in without identification and disheveled. The operation is a success, but the patient is raving like a lunatic.\n\nAyres, Lionel Barrymore as Dr. Gillespie and the rest of the Kildare regulars perform magnificently bringing a rather incredulous story to the screen. In real life even if he succeeded in his treatment, young Dr. Kildare would have probably lost his medical license and been hit with a malpractice suit that some dial a shyster lawyer.

Spencer Tracy is great as a manipulative bum who is capable of doing some pretty low things at times, but can actually be repentant and likeable at other times.  John Garfield is also good as another bum who gets a break only to be walked all over by Tracy's character.  And Frank Morgan is very memorable as a mysterious hermit dog lover who Tracy tries to decipher for selfish reasons.  And it's here that Hedy Lamarr proves conclusively that she wasn't reliant on glamor, as she gives a great performance as a poor Portuguese girl with slightly untidy hair, inexpensive clothing, and nominal makeup.  And she looks as gorgeous as ever despite all that!  This movie was the last serious effort MGM made to get Hedy Lamarr a good role in a good movie and make a bigger star of her.  Unfortunately, bad timing (the U.S. having recently been forced into WWII) caused a lack of public interest in this film when it was released, and MGM rapidly lost interest in her from that point on.  She went on to make only five more films for MGM, and while most of them are decent and entertaining enough, none are truly excellent. Too bad.  She was wonderful!",

The similarity is that both are good films that have contained within them really terrific scenes. I guess you could say that in these films, the parts are in some ways greater than the whole.\n\nFor me, the best scenes in \"Tortilla Flat\" revolve around Frank Morgan, who plays a sort of tramp (homeless man) who goes around with a bunch of dogs. Like Mr. Morgan, one of the dogs seems to have appeared in \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- yes, I think Toto is in \"Tortilla Flat.\" Not surprising, since both films were directed by Victor Fleming.\n\nBut the most extraordinary scene is that in which Frank Morgan has gathered his five dogs, in the midst of the majestic Redwood Forest, and relates to the dogs the story of St. Francis. As he is telling the story, the dogs actually have a vision! As the vision hovers, and the dogs react, Morgan averts his eyes. When the vision passes, Morgan shouts to the dogs: \"Did you see him? Did you see him? It was St. Francis! What good boys you must be to see St. Francis!\"\n\nI know of few other films that depict pure religious experience so effectively. It raises this good film onto another level.",

And the Costello of this story is of all people John Garfield.\n\nGarfield inherits a couple of houses courtesy of his late grandfather and Tracy and his friends move in to free load. Garfield also has his eye on Hedy Lamarr who works in a cannery and for a husband, much as she likes Garfield, doesn't want a shiftless loafer for a life partner. Garfield has to mend his ways before he's got any chance with her. Of course the prospect of kanoodling with Hedy Lamarr is enough to make any man straighten out, even get a haircut.\n\nTracy has no intention of changing his ways. He even tries to bilk simple hermit Frank Morgan out of his savings. Morgan, who's called the Pirate in this film, got an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor and he's the best one in the film. Close to him is the always dependable Henry O'Neill as the local parish priest.\n\nTortilla Flat is about as opposite a story from The Grapes of Wrath that it's hard to believe they come from the same author, John Steinbeck. The Grapes of Wrath is about hard working Anglo farmers from Oklahoma who've lost everything and just want the chance to earn a living from the soil again. Tortilla Flat's paisanos have an attitude about work that is on the level of Maynard G. Krebs.

                "text": "There is no denying that the man who gave us THE GRAPES OF WRATH, OF MICE AND MEN, and EAST OF EDEN is a major literary figure - one of the handful of American literary figures to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. But John Steinbeck was also a man of his time and some of his time is hard to swallow. This is particularly when dealing with his novels and stories dealing with Latin-Americans in California. A man raised in the early 20th Century, his views of Latinos is rather heavily into stereotypes. That he could develop character despite the stereotypes was a sign of his abilities as a fine writer...but those stereotypes remain as a stigma today.\n\nIn TORTILLA FLAT Steinbeck looks at life among a set of Latinos in Salinas, California. The central figure is Pilon (Spencer Tracy) who is a happy - go - lucky type, without any interest in life but what pleasure (food, partying, girls, booze) he can get out of it. But he does not like to work. Nor do his pals Pablo (Akim Tamiroff), Tito (Sheldon Leonard), Jose (John Qualen), and Daniel (John Garfield). But then Daniel learns his uncle died and left him two houses. He suddenly changes a little (he is a property owner) but that is soon dented when Pilon reminds him they are pals and he owes them a share of his good fortune. Somewhat unsettled by this, he does agree to letting the four freeloaders use the other house. The wisdom of this action is shown when they gradually let the nice little house go to ruin, ending with them accidentally burning it down (Pilon just smiles and shrugs his shoulders at this).\n\nMeanwhile Daniel meets Dolores Ramirez (Hedy Lamarr), a young woman who works in the local fish cannery. Daniel starts changing his whole views on life by his desire to woo Dolores - she feels her husband has to be a hard working man to win her respect. But Pilon and the others resent this hold Dolores has on Daniel. Pilon in particular tries to break up the love affair, but only manages to make his friendship with Daniel get strained. \n\nDaniel now has a job too at the cannery, but the others are still gainfully unemployed. Pilon decides that he and the others can rob \"the Pirate\" (Frank Morgan) a lonely eccentric. The best scenes in the film deal with Morgan, who turns out to be a touching old man who loves his pets and is saving his money for a religious offering for them. \n\nI won't go into the rest of the plot (which shows that Pilon can be a real friend too when he wants to be). Again it is well acted, although Tracy is reusing his \"Spanish\" accent that he used as Manuel in CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS, and would use again in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. Lamarr and Garfield actually display some chemistry together to heat up their scenes. Garfield too is slightly reusing a previous accent - his \"Porfirio Diaz\" voice in JUAREZ toned down a little. Actually if it wasn't for the performances (particularly Morgan's) the film would only have the character development shown by Tracy and Garfield. But the weakness of the stereotypes makes this film a difficult one to swallow. So I can only give it a \"7\" out of \"10\".",

Ludicrous casting, especially when the story is so ethnic.\n\nBut, maybe it was genius as common stereotypes about Afro- and Mexican-Americans are played out in the form of Tracy, as a shiftless bum who mooches off his friends and manipulates them into providing him with wine and a roof over his head. Pilon (Tracy) is not interested in satisfying anything but his own belly and even goes after a poor wood-seller called The Pirate, in the form of Frank Morgan, who, in a Scorcese moment, got the Oscar nomination he should have gotten three years earlier for The Wizard of Oz.\n\nLamarr was as beautiful as ever, and John Garfield did a great job as her pursuer, even as he had to avoid complete ruin from the machinations of Pilon.",

                "text": "There are two standout features of this film version of John Steinbeck's TORTILLA FLAT. One is the improbably beautiful HEDY LAMARR as a Portugese girl, showing more fire and spirit than usual in an unusual role (for her). The other is FRANK MORGAN, who in an exquisite sequence set in a forest, does an unforgettable job as an old man who thinks his dogs have seen a vision.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty hard to accept SPENCER TRACY (again assuming the sort of accent he had in CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS) as the town's laziest and most conniving drifter, JOHN GARFIELD, SHELDON LEONARD and others as Latinos with Brooklyn accents showing, and AKIM TAMIROFF, the only supporting player who seems the least bit authentic.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent, a minor trifle in which it's pretty obvious that the California fishing community has been filmed on studio soundstages at MGM with the actors often photographed against location shots filmed in northern California's Monterey. \n\nDefinitely a Victor Fleming film that hasn't dated well and many will find offensive in its racial stereotypes. It's a wonder J. CARROL NAISH didn't find his way into the suppporting cast. He would have been a lot more believable than casting actors like ALLEN JENKINS and CONNIE GILCHRIST as Chicanos.\n\nAn almost unrecognizable FRANK MORGAN deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination as The Pirate, a lazy, dog-loving eccentric whom Tracy tricks into revealing the whereabouts of his money. He's in the film's most memorable sequence but most of the film is slow and talky to an irritating degree and filled with unsympathetic characters.",

Pilon the self appointed leader of the loafers does what he can to make sure it doesn't interfere with the set up. Tragedy threatens but fear not, MGM is not about to let that happen to this lighthearted look at alcoholism and vagrancy in the Latino community.\n\nOz and Wind director Victor Fleming is certainly off form with his cast of miscast performers sounding and looking ridiculously out of place. Spencer Tracy in Coppertone face as Pilon gives an insulting and embarrassing performance as does Lower East Side John Garfield's Danny. Hedy Lamarr is passionate and impressive but unconvincing as a Portuguese immigrant. Akim Tamiroff does his usual generic immigrant and Frank Morgan is outstanding as dog lover Pirate. Unlike the blustery characters he played in so many films Morgan is both genuine and moving in look and feeling. He is the films only redeeming quality especially the scene with his scruffy band of mutts that takes place in an almost mystical forrest. The rest is all Hollywood arrogance and insensitivity.",

                "text": "I have rarely encountered such a Hollywood film so loaded with dreadful stereotypes as \"Tortilla Flat\".Those reviewers who lauded it must have been on a different planet or love film tripe of the lowest common denominator.\n\nFirstly according to some unenlightened producers, Hollywood had, at the time, a racist attitude to casting.There were either American/English actors or \"Foreigners\".If the cast called for \"foreigners\" no matter what the nationality of the character/actor, producers would cast a motley collection of actors from different countries and were not pedantic about the accuracy of the countries of origin of the actors concerned when consistency was required to make the characters believable.To cast Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr with her sophisticated Viennese accent, and the Jewish John Garfield as Mexican peasants was risible.Second stereotype - casting Mexican characters as a lazy work shy people who laze around in the sun and shun work but get drunk.Third stereotype - to insult the audience that they cannot be trusted to understand one sentence of Spanish.To just put the odd \"amigo\" or \"adios\" into the script to add a foreign sense but saying all their parts in English is rather patronising and a \"cop-out\".As an aside, enlightened producers like Darryl F. Zanuck who produced \"The Longest Day\" (1962) had German actors speaking German, French actors speaking French (with English subtitles) which made the film really come alive.Nowadays DVD technology gives dubbing into many languages for modern films but of course this technology was not available in 1942.However, with the U.S.A. catapulted into WWII from 1941, I can, to a certain extent, sympathise with the anti foreigner stance in films of this period.\n\nThe only reason I bought this video was to add to my Hedy Lamarr collection and I was slightly disappointed with the length of part she was assigned.I thought with her intellect she deserved much better than John Garfield's character at the film end.The fact that it is not available on DVD seems to show that sensible distributors realise no thinking film fan would want to pay for it in this format.So in this DVD age I bought an old video from 1990 to play on my reconditioned v.c.r. player.I have given this film my lowest ever rating of 1/10.Awful just awful.",

When one of the houses burns down and Danny is hurt fighting, Pilon makes an effort to make life better for his friend.",
            "Among those that live in the community of Tortilla Flat - located in the hills above Monterey, California - are the paisanos, a small subset of the large Hispanic immigrant population of the area. The paisanos are idle and thus poor men who choose this life rather than work to earn a living. They happily live under the stars and live solely for the here and now, meaning good food and wine rather than any material possessions. Pilon, one their own, is largely able to manipulate the others to do what he wants to get that food and wine without him having to lift a finger and without them realizing that they are being manipulated. Things change when Danny Alvarez, one of the younger paisanos, inherits from his recently deceased grandfather an expensive pocket watch and two houses in Tortilla Flat. Pilon senses opportunities to parlay Danny's new possessions into his wants, again without having to do any work or pay any money, one of the wants now including a roof under which to sleep. One of those opportunities involves the Pirate, another poor elderly man who lives in poverty in a shack next to the woods with his many dogs. The Pirate collects and sells wood, his entire take which is 25\u00a2 a day. As he never sees the Pirate spend any money and as 25\u00a2 a day adds up, Pilon is certain that the Pirate has a large cache of money hidden away somewhere which could buy a lot of good food and wine. All Pilon's plans may be threatened with the arrival of Dolores Ramirez, a young ethnic Portuguese woman, into Tortilla Flat. For Danny, who nicknames her Sweets, it's love at first sight, while it is a love/hate feeling from Dolores' side, she who sees a man who is unwilling to work to live and support whoever in his life. Pilon figures that he has to nix the burgeoning love between Danny and Dolores for him to continue to get what he wants."

The film won the Mussolini Prize at the Venice International Exhibition of Cinematographic Arts of 1942. Good acting and very good musical score. What is surprising is the anti-war undercurrent of the film. Nazi censors would have never certified such a movie for German audiences. Maimed soldiers, dead children, broken homes -- the high human cost for waging war is not kept from the audience (even the British are portrayed as fairly ordinary people!). Amedeo Nazzari is probably the only actor one might recognize, since he went on to have a distinguished career after the war, although here he seems to play his part without much conviction. The rest of the cast does well, and the film portrays a side of the war that is seldom seen outside Europe.

This story centers around a Communist group who are spying through people simply going to a deli or beauty salon. The spies are working at these type of places and listening to people talk about their jobs, which is how information is spread around and various objects destroyed by these groups. This film comes off more like a WW2 propaganda film than an entry in the series but either way the movie works fairly well. The story itself, asking people not to talk, seems a bit far fetched today but I'm really not sure how it would have been taken back in the day. This wasn't the only short to deal with people talking too much as we also had Mr. Blabbermouth!, which was released the same year as this film and it too received an Oscar nomination. We also get some nice performances from a familiar cast including Barry Nelson as an FBI agent and Gloria Holden, from Dracula's Daughter, as a waitress doing some of the spying. There's some nice shoot outs at the end as well.",

            "This MGM short, part of the Crime does not Pay series, focuses on industrial sabotage during wartime. After a valuable shipment of manganese is blown up at a plant, the FBI try to find out how information on the manganese shipment was found out. They get a lead on one of the plotters, Beulah Anderson, who as a waitress in a caf\u00e9 gets to pick up all kinds of scuttlebutt from the innocent but loose talking clients. Once they figure out how she is sending the information she gathers, the FBI sets a trap. The moral of the story is: Don't Talk!",
            "The MGM Crime Reporter introduces FBI Special Agent Jack Sampson, who talks about wartime industrial espionage and the damage done by foreign agents on US soil receiving information through what are innocent means of those passing the information unwittingly to them. Changing the names to protect the innocent, he talks about one case initiated by a bombing at Harmon Industries, where a shipment of materials key to the war effort were destroyed. Five loading dock workers were questioned, they who were the only ones who knew internally about the shipment, and how they may have spread information of the shipment through social chit chat. Checking places such as where the men got their hair cut or where they ate, Sampson's team found that the background of waitress Beulah Anderson at the Elite Caf\u00e9 did not check out. They discovered that she was really a foreign spy gathering intel on key Harmon shipments through this social chatter of Harmon workers eating at the caf\u00e9. The FBI couldn't pick her up until they found out her local team and how she was disseminating that information to them.",
            "This Crime Does Not Pay series entry dramatizes the idea that during wartime, people should not discuss anything related to their work when in public. A casual remark can be overheard by an enemy agent and used to sabotage the war effort. In this short, the story involves shipments of parts to a defense plant."

Temple plays Penny Hale, a child who returns home from boarding school to her prominent architect father (Charles Farrell), unemployed and now living in a basement of the same skyscraper in which they used to live in style up in the penthouse. Amanda Duff, a new Fox starlet at the time, is featured as Farrell's love interest.\n\nSongs by Walter Bullock and Harold Spina include: \"Just Around the Corner\" (sung during opening credits); \"This is a Happy Little Ditty\" (sung by Shirley Temple, with Joan Davis, Bert Lahr/danced by Bill Robinson and Temple); \"Brass Buttons and Apple-Lass\" (sung and danced by Bill Robinson and doormen); and the lively tune, \"I Like to Walk in the Rain\" (sung by Temple/danced by Temple and Robinson).\n\nAside from familiar character actors in the supporting cast, featuring the likes of Franklin Pangborn and Cora Witherspoon (who later appeared opposite WC Fields in 1940s THE BANK DICK), along with Joan Davis and Bert Lahr as maid and chauffeur, some of the comedy strains for laughs. Shirley was about 10 years old when this movie was made, and recites lines and lands herself in comedic situations that would have performed better if she were a few years younger. Instead of being cute, she appears more silly than charming, sorry to say. The dance numbers in which she participates with Bill Robinson, as the building doorman, are still good but not given enough screen time to make amends for trite storyline. As with Temple's previous LITTLE MISS Broadway (1938), JUST AROUND THE CORNER plays at \"B\" movie length of 70 minutes, both giving some indication of it being longer, and having gone through some tight film editing process. Joan Davis whose name is billed second after Temple, disappears before the movie is half way over. What became of her? Maybe she and Lahr, who are very amusing together, had more to do, even in a supposed production number in a charity benefit near the film's end that possibly got the ax. Maybe deleted scenes such as the this might turn up as part of a documentary on 20th Century-Fox movies or Shirley Temple's career in the similar fashion to American Movie Classic's well constructed HIDDEN Hollywood (From the vaults of 20th Century-Fox) specials that premiered in the mid 1990s. Charles Farrell, billed third, as Temple's (supposedly) widowed father, had seen better days in his career at the old Fox Film Studios when he achieved popularity as the romantic leading man opposite Janet Gaynor in 12 feature films from 1927 to 1934. He was by then a name of the past whose movie career came to an end by 1941. And Shirley gets to share screen time opposite a boy actor, Bennie Bartlett, playing a rich \"momma's boy\" named Milton with curls and glasses, but with the encouragement by little Penny, Milton earns respect from his \"Uncle Sam\" (Claude Gillingwater Sr.) by losing those \"girly\" curls (Penny had given him a much needed haircut), and getting a black eye in a fight with a bully. Aside from that, Temple continues to play her usual \"little miss fix it.\" \n\nJUST AROUND THE CORNER, available on video cassette in both black and white and colorized versions since the late 1980s, appeared as part of Shirley Temple festivals on the Disney Channel in the early 1990s, followed by American Movie Classics cable channel from 1996 to 2001, and the Fox Movie Channel, where it is currently shown.

Much to her shock, the pickle-pussed apartment manager (Franklin Pangborn) gleefully tells her that her place is not there anymore. Residential maid Joan Davis rushes into her while walking a bunch of giant dogs (or actually, they are walking her), and takes her down to where she really lives: the garage apartment residence of the live-in engineer who now happens to be her father! It seems that Farrell's design of a residential skyscraper caused him to loose his job when the building of it stalled and now, he is in debt. The building's owner's niece (Amanda Duff) has tried to encourage her uncle (crotchety Claude Gillwater) to go through with the project, and when Temple meets \"Uncle Sam\" (as he is known), she tries to help him after seeing a look-alike drawing of America's \"Uncle Sam\" in the newspaper.\n\nJust another \"Little Miss Fix-It\" showcase for Temple, she is as cute as ever, but some serious talent threatens to outshine her. As maid and chauffeur, Joan Davis and Bert Lahr get little to do, but share a musical number with her that is taken over by the tap-dancing talents of Bill Robinson who also dominates the benefit finale. Farrell and Duff provide the romance, while Shirley gets a partner in crime with the precocious Benny Bartlett, a sniveling bratty rich kid who stands up to a bully and gets a silver dollar from Gillingwater for getting a black eye while his snooty dim-witted mother (Cora Witherspoon) faints in shock after Temple cuts off Bartlett's obnoxious looking curls.\n\nThen, there's Franklin Pangborn in one of his largest parts, basically playing an unlikable apartment manager whose main goal seems to keep Shirley from having fun. That makes him a villain of sorts, although he's a villain who never gets to win at his schemes. In certain scenes, he even begins to resemble Bela Lugosi with the teeth clenched in so far into his mouth that he seems either toothless or lipless. He laughs in brown-nosed mock humor at Witherspoon's unfunny jokes and at the end involves the police in his vendetta against Shirley which, of course, doesn't go off as he planned. His exit scene is reminiscent of Margaret Hamilton's \"I'm melting!\" speech in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nBy 1938, 20th Century Fox was obviously running out of ideas for new Shirley Temple stories, and while she certainly appears to be younger than her 10 years, the tide was beginning to turn with singers like Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin (ironically older than her) taking over \"slowly but surely\". The films were still entertaining, featured some great supporting players, and had decreased running times for the most part. In this case, \"Just Around the Corner\" was an ironic title considering that within two years, Shirley's Fox career would be history.",

Through the course of the film, she remains unabashedly optimistic and does her best to make everyone have a happily ever after--even the nasty old man she refers to as 'Uncle Sam'! I liked and disliked the film. The humor was very sweet and you can't help loving Shirley. Additionally, the theme song throughout the film is very peppy and you'll most likely find yourself humming along with it. But, on the other hand, the optimism angle wore a bit thin, as did the stuff about Uncle Sam and the Depression. In fact, it came off, at times, as pure propaganda. Had the intent been disguised a bit, it would have made it all less obvious.\n\nIf you do see the film, pay attention to the fund-raiser at the end. Shirley had a huge bag of nickels from all the kids who paid to see it. However, when you see the ridiculous sets and costumes, the kids should have paid at least $100 a ticket to break even!! Silly, but also kind of funny.\n\nAdditionally, look for Charles Farrell in a rare starring appearance. Although Farrell was arguably the most famous male star of the late silent age, by 1938 his career was pretty much over in Hollywood. Why? I have no idea nor is there any indication why on his IMDb page. Also, this is the fourth and final film pairing Shirley and Bill Robinson--and to watch them dance, that's more than enough reason to watch the movie.",

That's unusual for Hollywood. \n\n\nWarren Williams is an obsessed District Attorney who is incapable of any human feeling toward the people he prosecutes.  And then a case comes along.  A refined, educated, teacher kills his wife in a moment of mad jealousy.  Warren has no mercy for him.  Coaxes him into a confession with the ultimate goal of executing him.\n\nThe gimmick in this story is that, during the trial, he realizes that he is living a parallel life.  He has neglected his own wife and come to believe that she is having an affair.  After following her to a friends house,  he finds himself with a pistol in his hand - a perfect parallel to the case he is trying.  It changes his life.\n\nWarren Williams has a tendency to overact, but to hear him bellow in the courtroom, and cackle with glee when he pulls one over on his adversaries, is not to be missed.  There is one caution.  Is it possible to be too sophisticated?  All the other actors are unremarkable, with the exception of Lillian Yarbo who plays the maid.  Her lines and expressions are priceless.\n\nIf, like me, you long for the days when Hollywood took the time to actually write a coherent script.  A time when dialogue really meant something.  A time when you second guessed the story and paid attention to the actors - instead of the special effects, take time out for this one.  If you can find it.",

William gets a confession out of him and goes full blast to give him the electric chair even with high priced defense attorney Samuel S. Hinds working for Morgan.\n\nWhat brings him to a reassessment of the case and his attitudes is an Othello like episode in his own life. There's no Iago in the film egging William on, but he develops an almost insane jealousy about his wife Gail Patrick and a young neighbor William Lundigan. And unlike Morgan it's all in his own mind.\n\nSome good attention should be paid for Cecil Cunningham as William's girl Friday assistant in his office who lives up to her character name of 'Sharpy' with some very devastating lines. But stealing the film whenever he's on screen is Ralph Morgan. Such a pitiable creature he is you can't conceive of someone like him going to the chair.\n\nThe film takes some interesting attitudes, not popular at this time about the death penalty.

Well, as a fan of the actor, I tend to agree--he DID over-act--and I generally liked his bigger than life and devil-may-care persona. That is why I decided to see \"Wives Under Suspicion\"--I'd watch just about anything starring this now forgotten star. Sadly, however, this was not one of his better films and it isn't surprising--by 1938, William had moved from his very successful career at Warner Brothers to Universal (a must less prestigious studio at that time) and the budgets were clearly smaller and it showed.\n\nThe film begins with William as a gung-ho District Attorney. He lives to prosecute and convict people--and his marriage and personal life have suffered. All he really cares about is winning--and sending as many people as he can to death row. However, when the case of a man who murdered his wife in a fit of anger (Ralph Morgan) is given to him, eventually the parallels between this case and his own sad life became apparent.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this film is that the cast was amazingly limp. Morgan and William were very competent actors, but here they were NOT at their best. In particular, Morgan has a scene where he is supposed to cry but it comes off very poorly--embarrassingly so. In addition, while the story idea is good, the direction and dialog is all either limp or overdone. Director Whale (who made quite a name for himself directing the first two Frankenstein films at Universal) had clearly seen better days and the film failed to impress. It really should have been a lot better given the neat story idea.",

Warren William and Ralph Morgan give solid performances and their scenes together - particularly the latter's confession and the subsequent trial - are certainly among the film's highlights. Unfortunately, however, as was the case with the blackface scene from Whale's own REMEMBER LAST NIGHT? (1935), the film's stereotyped depiction of William's black maid would, most probably, not go down well with today's audiences! \n\nWhile I never really understood why certain directors needed to remake their own films, I'm certainly glad it happened in this case - particularly since the original doesn't seem to be readily available (a regrettable situation with regards to most of Whale's non-horror titles!), but also because his second stab at the story has certainly made for a pretty good film in its own right.",

                "text": "A 1933 sleeper, \"A Kiss Behind the Mirror\", ranks a ***1/2 rating in classic movie guides, but other than classic connoisseurs is obscure today. Remade just five years later by the same director (James Whale), it is essentially a B version which came as the now legendary director's career was in n decline and nearing its end. Having seen both versions several times, I can confirm that the original version is brilliant, while the remake is a suitable programmer, professionally made, yet not the glossy triumph of Whale's prime.\n\nTaking place mostly in the D.A. office of Warren William, it focuses on his ambition and the neglect of his beautiful and affectionate wife, Gail Patrick. More concerned with his endless run of convictions than the emotional needs of his wife, William sends men to their deaths with little emotion. The sudden case of accused wife murderer Ralph Morgan parallels his own life, and truth soon becomes stranger than fiction, with William finding himself facing the temptations of crimes similar to the men he prosecutes.\n\nThe Universal of 1933 was glamorous and filled with hope of moving into the list of A movie studios. But hard times after the first cycle of horror movies had ended slowly brought them back down to low budget vehicles, with mainly Deanna Durbin musicals receiving box office attention. This is made on an obviously recycled Durbin set, looking good but feeling rather familiar after dozens of other law related dramas where the defense attorney did pretty much anything to get a release while the D.A. pretty much pulled the same tricks for a conviction. \n\nWilliam is as delightfully pompous as always, with sophisticated Patrick playing a heroine rather than a bitch for a change. Cecil Cunningham is a delight as the wisecracking secretary, a la Helen Broderick/Eve Arden. Ironically, Ralph Morgan's more famous brother, Frank, played the William version in the original version, with Paul Lukas in the other Morgan's part and future Titanic old Rose, Gloria Stuart, as the wife. The mirror scenes between William and Patrick add a magnificent effect, but see the original version if you can to see the difference.",

William (as an attorney for the state) and Gail Patrick (as his wife), also some customary but unfunny comic relief provided by a black actress. M. Stone has a good supporting role, as a nervous young man, appropriately submissive to his chief, several scenes, from which one senses he was deserving more (though in his scenes with W. William he looks deferent and respectful enough, as required by his role); he's somewhat like a slimmer Wayne, or a much tougher Lemmon.\n\nAfter five yrs, Whale shot again a script, this one; the result is thrilling, but unsubtle dramatically, in that the attorney's shift resembles a sudden conversion (he becomes aware of jealousy and neglect, but this reshapes also his whole professional approach, as his cruelty and malevolence are distinct from his conjugal behavior, although likely kindred, related \u0085). The movie has been carefully made, though it might of seemed somewhat more conventional than the director's other works. Although, given that he remade one of his earlier movies, he might of been fond of the script. Whale has been essentially a genre director, and this movie corresponds to the genre approach, being not a straight drama, but a genre movie, like one made by Sekely, and like countless others \u0085; it follows that his courtroom story is a good show, unsatisfying dramatically: unsubtle, mediocre, but stylish.\n\nW. William has a now outdated hawkish handsomeness, appreciated in the older movie-making, reminding of Menjou (only, of course, meaner), but also of Rathbone. In a Universal show, he resembles also one of Hammer's future character actors. His acting being mono-chord, the shift comes across as less believable.\n\nHere, he plays a severe, heartless, cruel, sardonic attorney of the state; the idea of the script has been that one of his cases changes so much his thought, as to reshape completely his whole being, and perhaps this shift should of been more gradual, less instant in its effects, though it had been prepared enough by the attorney's exposure to the case. As the malevolent attorney (the Inquisitor, the executioner), he looked his role; and there's also his morbid toy, the abacus, and Whale's savvy directing. The turning, the shift in front of the court was less convincingly played. This shift is less believable, and not very well conveyed by the leading actor himself.\n\nI think Whale achieves much given the nature of the script, so that the storyline is polished and neat, the drama is simple but deepened, and MacAllen's case offers a striking reference, so that the style comes across as both popular and thoughtful. Some lines are beautiful, like that about the strange perversity of destructiveness.",

The only one who is older than his \"star-kid\" days is Jackie Cooper. (but he went on to a successful adult acting career, anyway-- mostly on TV).\n\nBonita Granville, who received 2nd billing to Cooper, did her best (which is not much different than her 'Nancy Drew' roles at Warners). I've always been fond of Granville in supporting roles (or B-film leads), but a little bit of Bonita can go a long way. She wisely gave up acting before outgrowing her youthful charms.\n\nGene Reynolds, who was billed 3rd, was easily the best of all of this film's young actors. As the central character, who's innocent father is imprisoned for a murder that all the teens set out to solve, he pretty much steals the show.\n\nReynolds, a good-looking and accomplished young actor, made many films as a\nteenager but none as an adult. He did, however, go on to become an extremely successful (and extremely rich) TV producer-director. Reynolds would become best known for winning numerous Emmys for his long-running hit television series, \"M.A.S.H.\".\n\nLeo Gorcey, fresh out of the 'Dead End Kids', but before starting in Monogram's 'East Side Kids' series, isn't given much to say in this film, and is actually relegated to a role as one of the 'background' kids!\n\n\nHe probably never forgot this experience. -- When Gorcey was adult enough to have a hand in producing the 'Bowery Boys' films, he made sure that he had ALL the lines, and that the other guys (except Huntz Hall) had only enough lines to discern them from the backdrops.\n\nGail Patrick, the leading female adult in \"Gallant Sons\", has a pivotal role in this story playing Bonita Granville's mother. A much under-rated actress, Gail Patrick gives a lot to this supporting part. She received 4th billing, after Cooper, Granville and Reynolds.\n\nThe film has the usual MGM polish, though none of the excesses of the Rooney-Garland juvenile extravaganzas produced in the same period. (And, thank goodness, no singing & dancing...)\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed \"Gallant Sons\", and I especially liked seeing Gene Reynolds handle the most complex role of any of the young characters. Certainly more endearing than Cooper or Gorcey, I can't help wondering why Reynolds didn't pursue acting as an adult. Could he have seen the coming bonanza that television producing would bring his way?\n",

Here, we see him looking a little plump (especially in the derriere); but he was handsome and a fine actor. Too bad his career as a star didn't continue into adulthood. (He made a big name for himself behind the scenes, but that was a loss, because here and in such movies as \"The Get-Away\" he was an excellent actor.)\n\nThe plot involves two friends, one of whose father is put in jail for a murder he didn't commit. The other's father is a newspaper man who printed the story.\n\nThese two and their pals do some good sleuthing and come up with a  suspect. To smoke him out, they put on a play, a la the play within the play in \"Hamlet,\" which they feel will make him confess.\n\nIt's all suspenseful, exciting, and fun.",

A group of friends (Cooper, Leo Gorcey, Gene Reynolds, Bonita Granville, William Tracy, Tommy Kelly) set out to prove that Johnny's (Reynolds) father (Ian Hunter), who runs a gambling house, did not murder a woman. He was caught by the police standing over the body holding the murder weapon and was convicted. Byron's (Cooper) dad (Minor Watson) is a newspaper man and naturally covers it in the paper. Johnny and Byron are then on the outs.\n\nByron asks Johnny, if they can find out what really happened the night of the murder, can they just shake hands and forget it, no matter the outcome? Johnny agrees.\n\nThe kids soon become involved in what turns out to be a case with some interesting clues that also expose a long-held secret that Kate's (Granville) mother (Gail Patrick) knows, which concerns Johnny.\n\nUltimately they take a page out of Hamlet's book in order to solve the case.\n\nIt's a good story, given energy by the young talent. Jackie Cooper, who was a beautiful little boy and effective actor, made the transition to adult actor, as well as directing and producing and continued until retirement in 1990. In his grown-up years, he played likable men who did not seem to have a lot of angst,as opposed to the roles he played in childhood, and he was always very natural.\n\nLeo Gorcey gives the film his \"Dead End Kids\" performance, and Bonita Granville is her usual pretty and vivacious self. Gail Patrick, with her beautiful speaking voice, is elegant and lovely. Both Granville and Patrick are known for off-camera work -- Granville being the owner of TV's Lassie, and Gail Patrick as the producer of TV's Perry Mason.\n\nEnjoyable. I admit to loving Jackie Cooper - my mother used to talk about seeing him in the movies when she was a child, and I watched him faithfully on \"The People's Choice\" and \"Hennessy.\"",

This one is well produced and the cast features some of the East Side/ Dead End Kids from other films. I found it quite engrossing as it is kind of a \"Saved By The Bell \" only this is the adult version and it is pulled off about as well as it could have been done.\n\nGeorge Seitz who directed the Andy Hardy series did this one and it gives you the feeling of the veteran director's work.",

Johnny believes that By's father, a newspaper man, mistook some evidence and was the main reason his father was sent up. By, wanting to save their friendship, comes up with an idea to try and see if his father really was guilty or not. GALLANT SONS isn't a great movie and there are countless plot holes in it but I think fans of the cast members are going to have a good time. It seems like MGM wanted to get just about every kid star on their lot with the exception of Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney who were off doing bigger projects at the time. Not only do we get Reynolds and Cooper but there's also Bonita Granville from Warner's Nancy Drew series, William Tracy and Leo Gorcey who was doing time before the East Side Kids. I've always enjoyed watching these actors in their own films so it was another treat seeing them all together even if the screenplay doesn't hold up too well. The direction is also a tad bit off the mark because it's never quite clear if they're wanting this to be a dark drama or some light comedy with a few dramatic elements. There are moments where we get all sorts of silly slapstick including a scene where the boys are trailing the possible real killer and one of them falls down a flight of steps after seeing a black cat. These comedy bits really don't work too well but the drama is pretty good because the actors sell that. I thought Cooper and Reynolds were both quite good in their roles and the best moments of the film happen early on after the father is in jail and the two have a falling out. I've always enjoyed Granville's performances and it always shocked me she was never able to get out of these \"B\" roles because she was a fine little actress and she also had the looks. Gorcey offers up the type of performance that you'd expect from him but I'm guessing this is because he really couldn't give any other type. His \"Dead End\" type performance goes against what the other kids are acting but his fans will still get a kick out of him. GALLANT SONS ends in a rather silly manor but fans of the stars will at least be entertained throughout, which is a lot more than most movies can say.",

Only thing is that one of the help is running a gang that upper management knows nothing about. Gabby Hayes is on hand as Wild Bill's friend and former deputy.\n\nOne of the honest but short-tempered independent drillers is framed, and that places Wild Bill squarely in the middle. But he's smart and he knows how to use the law to advantage. The plot twists and turns, but always logically. Republic had some very good script writers for these above-par westerns.\n\nAnne Jeffries is on hand as a female interest to fill out the 1 hour b-western. Bill Elliott makes good use of his deep voice. Good fun, and it feels good to know that justice is going to win out in the end. This, after all, is a 1943 feature.",

Hayes decides to become an oil wildcatter, but in his area all the wildcatters are being squeezed by an unscrupulous oil company executive. When the local law is accidentally killed, Elliott is sent into the area to straighten things out.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Bill Elliott's screen persona is that he comes across at times like a Dudley DooRight, especially in his early films. But usually he's also working a few angles that people around him don't get to bring the bad guys down.\n\nAnne Jeffreys is in the cast to sing Carry Me Back To Old Virginny and for love interest. That's another thing, Elliott did make no secret of the fact he liked girls in his westerns, no kissing the horse for him. Jeffreys is the niece of Judge Herbert Hayes who is in league with the villain Weldon Heyburn.\n\nFans of Wild Bill should be pleased with Death Valley Manhunt.",

To the background sound of clinking spurs we're treated as usual to plenty of chases, wonderful scenery, gunfights, a brief romance for Lucky, a neck-tie party, comedy this time coming from Andy Clyde joining the team. William Boyd and Russell Haydon put in their usual good performances as the unflappable Cassidy and young sidekick Lucky. Favourite bit: California winging one of the baddies, then shooting him dead. Hoppy reproaches in jest \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself shooting at a cripple\" \u0096 \"I was only trying to be humane\" \u0096 swift justice indeed!\n\nI think I've probably seen about a bar-20 of these films but it looks par for the course, a well made programmer with so-so acting and plot but mainly for the kids and people like me.

And, he brings along a new sidekick--aptly named California. Together with Lucky, the trio work on restoring justice. And, as if VERY typical of the genre. there's a baddie who has a large group of hired guns who's intent on stealing the land of all the little guys.\n\nAbout the only unusual aspect of the film is that it's surprisingly violent for a B-western. As for the acting, Cassidy seems quite natural and the film is enjoyable throughout. Not a must-see but a decent little time-passer.",

The film finds local officers in an outlaw-infested town in California helpless to cope with the situation and a citizens committee comes to Texas and appeals to the Texas Rangers for help in organizing the forces of law and order. Captain Andrews of the Rangers offers the assignment to Hopalong Cassidy and Lucky Jenkins, but Cassidy, whose period of service in the Rangers is almost over, refuses. The as-usual impetuous Lucky takes the job alone. While on patrol duty, Cassidy is following the trail of a large herd of rustled horses and discovers the hide-out of the Bruce Morgan gang. The place is deserted except for a garrulous old cook who calls himself \"California Jack\" Carlson, who receives Cassidy who is posing as a Morgan friend and fellow outlaw Ben Stokes, whom California does not know. Cassidy arrests the frightened cook as a material witness against the gang and starts for Texas Ranger headquarters. Learning from Carlson that Morgan had planned to leave for the west coast, Cassidy gets permission from Captain Andrews to take up the trail. He is made a U.S. Marshal, which gives him blanket authority, and Carlson is taken along as a guide. Cassidy arrives in Santa Carmen, California just when newly-appointed town sheriff Lucky is foolishly setting out single-haned against Morgan and his gang. Cassidy and California join him and escape following a fight in which Lucky is wounded. They find refuge at the hide-out of Pico Serrano, once rich but now penniless, as he and other Californians have been cheated out of and driven from their homes by the unscrupulous Morgan and his gunmen. Lucky falls in love with Pico's daughter, Paquita. Cassidy organizes a posse and engages Morgan and his gang in a gun fight. Morgan, Stokes and others of the gang storm Pico's hide-out and, during the fighting, Paquita is mortally wounded and dies in Lucky's arms.

This set consists of six DVDs and almost 11 hours of shorts! \n\nLike most of the rest of the \"Melody Master\" series, this short features a more minimalistic approach. While there is a nice set that looks Hawaiian, it's not as fancy as many of the early Vitaphone films and it lacks any sort of story--just some songs and a trio of native girls doing a very slow and non-sexual hula! The biggest real difference is the band itself--as many of the band members appear to be native Hawaiians or at least part-Hawaiian. Their music strongly reflects this, as Kinney sings a bit in Hawaiian and the tune is very 1930s Hawaii in style. It's sort of like a merger of big band with native music--and I thought it was really quite enjoyable...and very, very mellow. Very, very, very mellow. So mellow that you might just fall asleep to the languorous tunes. Enjoyable.\n\nBy the way, in the second song, Kinney sings all about a guy from Molokai. Molokai, if you didn't know, is one of the Hawaiian islands and was a leper colony as well. A strange choice of subjects for a song!",

This here isn't the most impressive I've seen but if you're curious about the type of music people were listening to in 1938 then that's enough of a reason to check this out. The film didn't feature a single song that I was familiar with but their arrangements weren't too bad even if none of them really jumped out at me.

In fact, I give the film an 8 just because the quality of the animation and backgrounds is just amazing--and better than most of the art in the full-length cartoons of the day. The intricacy of the art with its fine details and wonderful color palate are terrific and are hard to miss. It is truly the apex of Disney's art.\n\nAs for the story, it's very simple. Donald, Mickey and Goofy run a tugboat service and hear a distress call concerning a boat about to hit the rocks. So, it's up to the boys to spring into action to save the day. The problem is that they are stupid and have the darnedest time just getting the boat going due to Goofy's and Donald's incompetence. A little of this did go a long way, I admit, but the film is still enjoyable from start to finish and I had a good time watching it. Plus, compared to the insipid cartoons that were made by rival studios, it is clearly a superior product. As for MGM and Looney Tunes, they were still making mostly bland films--with their best stuff (such as the MGM Tex Avery films and Bugs Bunny) not to appear for another 2-3 years.",

The story is rather routine and reminded me a lot of The Whalers(the main reason why the ending wasn't so much as a surprise) and especially Clock Cleaners, and Mickey's re-design takes some getting used to especially as Donald and Goofy are kept the same. However, there is much to enjoy as Tugboat Mickey is beautifully animated especially in the colourful backgrounds, and the music is very energetic. The gags are familiar in a way, but they are still very funny especially with Donald's temperament with the steam piston and Goofy's confusion as the grate keeps closing on him. Mickey is not as funny but he is still likable and all three characters are impeccably voiced as always. Overall, a good cartoon if not one of the best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Many younger viewers may not understand the final gag, what with all the changes in American popular entertainment since 1940. Walt Disney provides Mickey with his squeaky voice; Clarence Nash does the honors for the Duck.\n\nWalt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by pictures &\ndrawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.\n",

This time out Joe is suffering from allergies and each morning he wakes up sneezing and this continues until he's back to bed. I prefer the later shorts in this series but for these early entries this one here is pretty good. As normal for this point in the series, we not only get O'Hanlon doing his comedy bit but Knox Manning doing the narration. What works best in this short as some of the backstory entries as we learn how allergies have effected the McDoakes family throughout time. The sequence about the very first man to walk past hay and sneeze was a good one as is what happens when a future McDoakes tries to solve the problem. We also get some \"facts\" told to us by Manning but many of these are extremely out of date so it's somewhat funny seeing what people were being told in 1945 compared to what we know today.",

This time Joe is suffering from allergies. We learn Joe has tried everything he can to stop them. The final twist that reveals what Joe was allergic to the whole time is very funny. We're also treated to an amusing look at how allergies affected Joe's ancestor, McGregor McDoakes, who we're told became history's first allergist after walking past a haystack and sneezing. Some of the 'facts' about allergies that narrator Knox Manning spouts sound pretty ridiculous today. Such as \"intelligent people or people in the upper & middle income brackets\" are more likely to have allergies than others. Another gem is that allergies are more likely to occur in \"highly emotional or nervous types.\" My favorite is that doodling is a sign of having allergies. I'm not sure if this was the actual thinking of the medical community back then or if the makers of the short just threw some old wives' tales in to set up some funny gags. Either way it's a fun look back at how people used to think. Very early appearances for future Charlie Chan star Roland Winters and Barbara Billingsley of Leave It to Beaver fame. Both are in the montage showcasing different types of allergy sufferers. The Joe McDoakes series from WB was a good one with the underrated physical comedy of George O'Hanlon always good for a laugh.",

His was the narrator/voice of so many short subjects, as well as Columbia Pictures' serials; such as BATMAN, TEX GRANGER, SUPERMAN, THE SEA HOUND and ADVENTURES OF SIR LANCELOT.\n\nTHE TRADITION OF playing the serious and the absurd right down the middle is continued as some very esoteric information is disseminated to the movie goers concerning the origins of some of our long standing allergies. Once again, the short combines a comic sojourn on the Mc Doakes family tree to a Scotland of 3 centuries prior with some really \"neat\" scenes of research scientists, replete with official white smocks, juggling various test tubes.\n\nIT BECAME A sort of on screen see-saw between progenitor Mac Gregor Mc Doakes (O'Hanlon) and the modern day scientific marvels. Old man Mac Gregor even possessed a microscope back in the Scottish Highland of Olde. (Eat your heart out, Brave-heart!) \n\nINTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH, the lecture portion touches on the possible connection between the physical problem of allergies and the distinct chances that the cause of many may well be psychosomatic. This would probably make it a sort of breakthrough in introducing so many of the non-medical field personnel to the very concept.\n\nAS FAR AS any other significant items or milestones in the Mc DOKESIAN Saga, well we must mention two.\n\nFIRST OF ALL, there was some brief use of animation in the Scottish Highlands scenes. It was done of a germ or other unknown microbe performing a typical scream from a Warner Brothers LOONEY TOONES or MERRIE MELODIES cartoon. Although not credited (so much wasn't) it sure sounded like Bea Benedaret to us! (Right Schultz!) \n\nADDING TO THIS picture's status is an element found in the Boudoir. Instead of the usual twin beds, Joe and Alice Mc Doakes were shown sharing a twin sized bed! \n\nOMIGOSH, JUST YOU imagine!

He wants to make it on his own and soon buys a struggling magazine that is considered liberal and on the fringe. It's NOT what the family wants but his father loves him and doesn't press Tom too often to change jobs.

What's to become of them?\n\nThis is a very good film and brings up some great moral quandaries. However, the movie has one problem...Cecelia is just too obviously a horrible person.

Typical scene: JOHN LODER says to ALEXIS SMITH: \"You are the most selfish woman I ever met.\" She replies coolly: \"Thanks for the compliment.\"\n\nThe cast is very good, including THURSTON HALL as Dennis Morgan's wealthy father and everyone handles the material with a deft enough touch. But there's nothing special about the story, another example of Barry's infatuation with telling stories about the idle rich but with less wit than usual.\n\nThe pleasure of watching Morgan, Sheridan, Wyman, Carson and Smith at work is the only possible reason for spending time with this light hearted but dull Philip Barry comedy that never really comes to life, not even when REGINALD GARDINER shows up with a discourse on liberal magazines. \n\nPeter Godfrey directs the whole thing in sluggish fashion.",

                "text": "Though I am still going through my virtually comprehensive Luis Bunuel retrospective, with this film I start tackling the unwatched work of another favorite film-maker \u0096 James Whale. For a long time, I was only familiar with his 4 horror classics but, little by little, I came upon the rest of his oeuvre and, at this stage, am only missing one i.e. PORT OF SEVEN SEAS (1938). What I have checked out so far of his non-horror efforts, all have proved extremely stylish and engaging, and even boasted distinct elements of his trademark quirkiness.\n\nThis, then, is his official swan-song \u0096 in 1949 he contributed an episode to an unreleased compendium, HELLO OUT THERE. Incidentally, the film under review does not have a good reputation at all: the director was unhappy with his last handful of assignments, since he had fallen out of favor due to the openness of his homosexuality \u0096 but this is really the first I have watched to display a lack of commitment on his part!; by the way, it is unclear what uncredited directors Fleming and Vidor contributed to the film, or whether he stepped in for them or they replaced him.\n\nAnyway, it is one of a number of efforts intended to further the cause of the conflict in Europe at a time when the U.S. was still not involved; as such, it is atypically ponderous for Whale, though the surface polish he was renowned for is still very much in evidence. Another drawback is the lack of chemistry between its two stars: George Brent (he is his usual suave self, despite purporting to be an exiled Austrian playboy prince who suddenly acquires a conscience and takes to 'fighting' the Nazis!) and Martha Scott (fresh out of her prestigious success and an Oscar nomination with OUR TOWN [1940] but highly miscast as Brent's love interest, the daughter of an eminent Professor who, once settled in America, incongruously takes to running a bar!). Much better is Paul Lukas, in his element as the chief Nazi, a local aristocrat who will not leave Brent alone \u0096 to his ultimate dismay! \n\nA good deal of the narrative occurs during sea voyages, with the first taking our four protagonists from Austria to the U.S. and then backwards, except that the ship's destination is actually Germany (Brent having bartered his life for that of seven other compatriots \u0096 the catch is that one of them, Edgar Barrier as Scott's fianc\u00e9, is actually a Nazi himself who had alerted Lukas to the hero's escape in the first place!). This lengthy climactic sequence gives early roles to both Lloyd Bridges and Peter Cushing, has the Captain take the side of the 'prisoners' (he even officiates during their wedding ceremony!) and ends with the ship being torpedoed by the British (after the Captain concealed a coded message from Germany of the enemy's imminent arrival!).\n\nMind you, the film is in no way painful to watch (there is even comedy relief courtesy of Lukas' befuddled associate!) and, as I said, quite good to look at\u0085only it is nowhere near the heights Whale had attained with his best work. Unfortunately, the quality of the print (probably a 16mm source, so rare is the film) left much to be desired \u0096 as the image fluttered on occasion and a stretch of it even suffered from dampened audio!",

                "text": "When Germany annexes Austria in 1938, Austrian prince Kurt von Rotenberg (Brent) escapes to the United States, where he gets romantically involved with his old acquaintance Marta (Scott), whose father (Brecher) reprimands him for not doing enough to help his people. Meanwhile, Gestapo officer von Helsing (Lukas) would very much like to see Kurt neutralized one way or the other, since he's a rallying point for Austrian dissidents.\n\nJames Whale's last film, where he was replaced as director due to various disagreements, has its points of interest but doesn't measure up to his earlier work. Many films similar to this one were made during World War II, stories about self sacrificing heroes and sinister Germans, but it's unusual and rather endearing that the heroes in this one are Austrians and that even the most evil of the villains, von Helsing, has some human qualities.\n\nThey Dare Not Love has some of the romantically doom laden atmosphere of Casablanca, although nowhere on the same level, while retaining much of the champagne-soaked, luxury cruise ship lightness of pre-war romances, which makes it a rather mixed emotional experience. There is no doubt that the filmmakers took the plight of the dissenting Austrians seriously or that they regarded Germany as the threat that it was, but there is an air of nonchalance to much of the movie, which may be due to several causes: the divided directorial vision, a wish to bring some fluffy entertainment to war-weary audiences, and/or the blandness of Brent and Scott.\n\nVisually, there are some classic James Whale touches, the most prominent one showing a body laid down beneath a giant crucifix at a muddy crossroads, but otherwise the film looks good without drawing attention to itself. In terms of energy it moves at a medium pace doing what it's supposed to do without many peaks and valleys, though I'll assume that a certain scene with Lukas and Bonen (see below) was either written or elaborated on by Whale and his peculiar brand of humour.\n\nThe story moves mainly in luxurious, trendy environments (at one point the signs of fashionable night clubs flash by in a montage), which is a rather good choice in showing the way Kurt throws himself into pleasures in order to forget about his duty and his sense of helplessness, so part of the perceived nonchalance is no doubt intended to highlight just what a change Kurt goes through when deciding to leave it all behind and make an attempt to help his countrymen. However, Brent isn't enough of an actor to make this change sufficiently startling to justify all the shallowness that has gone before, and his deficiency is compounded further by the feebleness and stupidity of the plan he comes up with to lend assistance.\n\nIn itself, the very clumsiness of his attempt at sacrifice is actually rather brilliant, giving us a human and flawed protagonist who really doesn't know how to be a hero, but this whole concept falls almost completely flat due to Brent's inability to give Kurt enough life \u0096 it's difficult to be touched by the failed heroic gestures of a cardboard cutout.\n\nPaul Lukas brings more to his character of von Helsing, who is also more inventively written than the stereotypical heroes. This Gestapo agent is evil, no two ways about it, but in a less feral way than you'd expect: he schemes to get Kurt married to an American woman so that he'll stay in the States rather than go back to Austria and lead the rebels. One has to admit this is a rather humane way of solving the problem, but of course in the end he does get around to plotting Kurt's demise. Lukas and Bonen also have a fun scene, probably the most vibrant in the picture, where they're arbitrarily arguing about whether a particular snatch of music is by Beethoven or Haydn.\n\nBrent and Scott are dull as butter knives, making it hard to care much about their cause or their growing love, but the supporting cast is seasoned with splendid character actors who bring some bite to what could otherwise have become solid tedium. Brecher, Barrier and Reicher were all prolific film actors who always made their presence felt, and it's good to see a very young Lloyd Bridges as a humourless Nazi.\n\nAnd then there's Peter Cushing, whose last Hollywood film this was before he went back to Britain. He appears when there are only three minutes left to go, but makes quite an impression, having a number of lines (delivered in that un-Peter Cushing-like voice he had when young) and projecting a commanding presence for all his youth. Immature as I am, I also giggled at the fact that he's appearing in a film by Frankenstein director Whale (their second one together, the first being The Man in the Iron Mask) and which features a character named if not Van, then at least von Helsing.\n\nDisposable fluff and hardly a worthy swan song for Whale, They Dare Not Love is at least passable fun for the moment.\n\nNot, it should be noted, an entirely easy film to get hold of, but it's out there.",

Story continuity didn't seem to rely on much believability with these films, as a newspaper headline and story indicates that Phil Connors (Tom Brown) was a saboteur. Later in the picture it's revealed that he was really infiltrating the secret Black Dragon Society, but it made me wonder how the ruse could have been pulled off for real. I suppose it could have worked, but you would have to have a lot of authorities in on it, and probably a miracle to pull it off.\n\nThere's also the question of the East Siders pelting shopkeeper Chino believing him to be Japanese, yet later they apologize to Mrs. Chino in a way that makes it seem that they've known each other a long time. It just seemed to create a kind of disconnect from reality in the story; why would the boys suddenly turn on Chino if they knew him as a regular from the neighborhood? \n\nAs a fan of the East Side Kids, I'm curious why Gabriel Dell wound up playing the German Heinbach in the story instead of being part of the gang. This kind of thing happened every now and then, and as a kid watching these movies it drove me crazy. It also bothered me that the core group of East Siders sometimes had different names from picture to picture, but looking back on that time, it doesn't seem like such a big deal now.\n\nBut at least the boys wind up heroes for breaking up a Japanese spy ring, even if they weren't old enough to join the military. What a difference a year makes though. In 1943's \"Kid Dynamite\", Danny, Muggs and Glimpy show up at the end of the picture, each in a uniform from a different branch of the service!",

Like a good number of other movies in this era, including others in the same series, this one takes many opportunities to promote its version of patriotism.\n\nThe story has the gang turned away from the enlistment offices because of their young ages, and proceeding instead to channel their energies into taking on a local group of Axis spies and sympathizers. The stereotyped depictions of the Japanese and German characters may not have elicited any significant degree of objection at the time, but they are very obvious now. Only the generally comic tone of the movie keeps them from becoming a more serious flaw.\n\nIn itself, the story and the movie do have their share of good moments, usually when Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, and the rest are allowed to indulge their free-wheeling style for a bit. There are better features in the series, but this one is all right, and it provides an interesting example of the many kinds of movies, stars, and genres from the early 1940s that showed a strong wartime influence.",

Outgaged over the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the East Sides kids lead by Muggs Danny & Grumpy, Leo Gorcey Bobby Jordan & Huntz Hall, try to enlist in the US military and are rejected not just because there underage but mentally deficient as well. Taking the war to the street of the Lower East Side of Manhattan they seek out any Japanese or Japs as they call them to make sure that the streets of the city are safe from Japanese ground air & naval attacks.\n\nNot that bright to begin with the boys not quite knowing the difference between a Jap, an enemy of the USA, and Chinese, a friend, they end up attacking with a bombardment of rotten fruits & vegetables a Chinese shop-owner whom they mistake for a Jap who in fact is working for the FBI as an undercover agent. It's later that the shop-owner is found dead, when the boys broke into his store and ransacked it, and their held for questioning by the police! Released because of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights in that the charges against them can't stick the boys decide to do the right thing in fighting the Japs legally. But totally overlook who's behind a major Japanese spy ring in the neighborhood Nazi spy Fritz Heinbach, Gabriel Dell, whom they consider to be a friend of there's as well as the USA. It's Fritz who's working with the dreaded Japanese Black Dragon Society to undermined the US effort in the war by planning to attack, through sabotage, all the major US military & naval facilities all along the East Coast! \n\n***SPOILERS***There's also a side plot to all this with Danny's big brother Phil, Tom Brown, who just graduated from Annapolis getting drummed out of the service for being not just a spy for Tojo or the Japanese, whom they paid $13.75 for being a traitor to his country, but involved in sabotage against his country as well. It's no big surprise that Phil like the late Chanise shop-owner is working undercover for the US Government in the fact that he wasn't just put behind bars for life but executed for committing treason against the USA during wartime! Most of the villains in the movie ended up doing themselves in, via Hari-Kari- making the job much more easier for the boys as well as the police to apprehend them and bring them all to justice. If they, the Japanese spies, just saw how easy their American collaborator Phil got off-Scot-free-they might just have kept themselves from doing themselves in!",

Unfortunately that doesn't happen here.\n\nI cut the East Side Kid movies a lot of slack where production values and plot coherence are concerned because I usually find them very entertaining anyway. For me, the best part of these movies is the humorous interaction between the characters and sometimes the goofy, even improbable story lines. This movie though, is not funny, and it's only marginally entertaining at best. Most of the humor either feels forced or plain just doesn't work.\n\nSo what's good about this one? I do like that when the boys realized the error of their ways they didn't just apologize but took action to make up for their mistake. In that sense this movie shows some of the heart for which the series is known. Robert Armstrong is good in his tiny role and Florence Rice has a great smile. This is also the outing where the boys end the film dressed in the uniforms of the various branches of the service, which is a fun little moment, even though they were denied enlistment earlier in the film due to their young age.\n\nOverall, while it did have a little heart, it lacked fun and seemed too forced or rushed.",

Now some of this isn't surprising--after all, it was meant as a WWII propaganda film and instilling hatred of the Japanese and Germans in the American public was the purpose of this and other Hollywood films of the day. However, this film goes MUCH further--and seems to encourage the persecution of German and Japanese-Americans. Because of this and bad writing, it's a nasty little film.\n\nThe movie begins with the Kids wanting to do their part for the war effort. However, they try to enlist but they are repeatedly turned away because they are underage. So, they do the next best thing--they pick out what they THINK is a Japanese-American business and break in and trash the place! Here is the rub--they find out that the guy is really a Chinese-American, so they feel bad about this--as if the film is saying this sort of vigilantism is FINE provided you carefully pick your targets!! Unfortunately, when they are destroying the place, they find the owner's dead body--and this eventually leads them into a Nazi-Japanese spy ring. And, given that this is a bad film, they take on the entire spy ring all by themselves and succeed in keeping America safe.\n\nAs I said, the film is amazingly jingoistic. While I am NOT a politically correct sort of person, even I felt offended by the film and it's shabby messages. Pretty bad from start to finish. Oh, and did I mention the fried chicken and watermelon remarks made to their Black friend, Sunshine Sammy?!",

But, it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. \"Let's Get Tough!\" was made during what the script accurately describes as \"open season on Japs\" - for this and other reasons, it hasn't aged well.

Of course she no more resembles a young man than I do Marilyn Monroe, but that's another operatic convention easily accepted. The minor roles are amusing and well smirked.

Jimmy, thinking Judy needs publicity in order to get a singing job on a radio program, thinks that a romance between her and the war hero would be just the ticket. Judy isn't too warm on the idea but agrees to go ahead for Jimmy's sake, with whom she thinks she is in love. She agrees to work on Buzz that night at the Manhattan Canteen, a converted night club where show business people entertain and wait on service men. Foggy is assigned to get pictures of Judy and Buzz together but fails through ineptness. Buzz escorts Judy home in a rainstorm and, while helping her out of the taxi, slips and falls into a deep puddle. Judy asks him to come in so she can dry his soaking-wet uniform on the kitchen stove. Foggy gains entrance to the apartment via the dumbwaiter and snaps a picture of Buzz in his underwear. The next morning Buzz tells Jimmy that he intends to marry Judy, which is going further than he had intended. He also decides he can't use the compromising - but innocent - photo for publicity purposes but does announce their - he thinks - publicity-only engagement. That clinches the deal for Judy to get a radio program called \"The Girl I Left Behind.\" Buzz proposes to Judy, who realizes she loves Buzz and not Jimmy, and they, not knowing that Jimmy has announced their \"engagement\", decide to keep it a secret."

At movie's end, we know as much about the leading man as we did at the beginning\u0097namely zilch. True, a more appealing hero than John \"Dusty\" King would have certainly have helped. Edward Keane\u0097in a rare, major role\u0097proves no great shakes either. \n\nThe heroine is also little more than a cypher, but fortunately she is so charismatically played by charmingly vivacious Marjorie Reynolds that our almost total lack of any knowledge at all as to her likes and dislikes, her background and personality, seems not to matter. True, the script stratagem that cements her into the plot is most obtrusively unconvincing, but nonetheless I'm not complaining on this score. What does upset me is that an opportunity for a first-class little \"B\" has been thrown away by inadequate scripting. \n\nAnother minus is that all the exterior train footage is so obviously stock material\u0097and rather ancient stock material at that! This lessens the movie's appeal for train buffs. And the usual racist \"humor\" with the eye-rolling porters doesn't help matters either. Tighter film editing was certainly called for.

Her career high point was co-starring with Bing Crosby in \"Holiday Inn\" (1942) and \"Dixie\" (1943), but she dressed up any movie she was in no matter how cheap the production.\n\nJoan Marshall (Marjorie Reynolds) is traveling on the Midnight Limited, a night train from New York to Montreal. She hears a scuffle in the next compartment and when she goes to investigate is also robbed by \"The Phantom Robber\"!!! She was robbed of papers that prove that she and her mother are the rightful heirs of a large estate but this plot goes nowhere. When she admits she had a glimpse of the robber she is immediately made a member of the police force (of course!!!) who are investigating the case. There are no surprises - it is obvious that the booking agent is involved after a gambler books a ticket on the train. It is well known that he is carrying $60,000 with him and surprise, surprise - he is robbed. Everything seems to fall into place for the viewer, long before the police figure it out!!!\n\nJohn \"Dusty\" King is a very lack lustre leading man. I was so surprised to read that he was a band singer. At one point in the film he is sitting down at the piano and sings \"Quiet Hands\" - very badly I thought!!! I was wishing why couldn't Marjorie have sung - she would have really livened up the film.",

However I'm going to have to admit something here - I don't know how the heck Valentine Lennon (John King) figured it out, even after he explained it to Miss Marshall (Marjorie Reynolds). How did he get from Point A to Point B to know it was Krantz (Monte Collins) in the baggage car that was in league with the Phantom Robber (I. Stanford Jolley)? Folks, this is bugging me.\n\nUp until the ending, I thought this little programmer had something fairly clever going for it. The desk clerk at the Ritz Plaza calling the plays was a pretty creative way to set up the train heists. But what about the guy they called The Professor (George Cleveland)? Except for the coincidence of being on the same runs on which the robberies occurred, that whole business with delivering the letters to Montreal was just a red herring. Am I missing something here? \n\nI have to say, I was a little surprised to see John 'Dusty' King in a leading role in this picture. I'm more used to catching him teamed up with Ray Corrigan and Max Terhune as one of The Range Busters, a popular cowboy trio of the era. And if I had to bet, the last time I saw Marjorie Reynolds she was portraying Peg Riley in the old 'Life of Riley' TV series opposite William Bendix. Now there's a memory. Tell you what, dispense with the story and just leave Miss Reynolds on screen for the hour and I'd be just as happy.\n\nAt some point, I think I'll have to go back and see what I missed here. The resolution to the mystery is still nagging me, so there must be a missing piece of the puzzle. When I figure it out I'll get back to you. Or better yet, if you figure it out, drop me a line.",

It compensates (or overcompensates) with hopped-up performances and some particularly gaudy patter (`a 45-caliber toothache').\n\nA clutch of his books is the only mark of achievement in mystery-writer Chester Morris' squalid basement apartment; he's on the losing end of an extortionate contract drawn up by his publisher (William Forrest).  Before heading uptown to confront him, Morris swigs some false courage from the heel of a bottle, telling himself `It isn't easy to beg money from a man you'd rather kick in the teeth.'  Nor is it such a good idea to ask for favors reeking of booze and with a couple days worth of beard stubble, but he charges ahead anyway. \n\nMorris muscles past the Veronica-Lake-ish secretary (Constance Dowling) to barge into Forrest's office, where the publisher is playing carpet golf with one of his successful authors (Steven Geray).  Barely coherent, Morris claims that even drunk he can dream up a top-notch plot, and begins to pitch his locked-room mystery before he's shown the door.  Down in the ground-floor bar, he continues recounting his story idea to the heard-it-all bartender (Sid Tomack), when he's joined by a suddenly fascinated Dowling.\n\nNext morning, the police arrest Morris for the murder of Forrest, who was found dead in his office, bolted from within.  Of course, he's lost the whole evening in a blackout.  Curiously, two unlikely advocates rally to his side \u0096 Geray, who praises the psychological realism of Morris' writing, and Dowling, whose motives remain murkier (gal pal or femme fatale?).  Circumstances take an even darker turn when the bartender, too, is found murdered in his bed....\n\nBlind Spot feels a lot like a Cornell Woolrich knockoff (writers, blackouts, homicides), yet it's not quite cheesy.  (The script reveals itself to be a keen student of the not-yet-identified noir cycle, with a couple of Hollywood in-jokes, including a veiled reference to The Lost Weekend.)  Morris made the movie as a break from the \u009140s programmers which are his chief claim to fame, the Boston Blackie series, after which his career swiftly petered out. His biography includes one arresting detail, however: `In 1951, Morris received the deathbed confession of his friend Roland West for the murder of actress Thelma Todd in 1935.'  Sounds like the beginning of another Boston Blackie script.",

It's another masterly essay in irony from the pen of Martin Goldsmith of Detour fame. The plot involves a desperate, alcoholic writer who sarcastically pitches a \"locked room\" murder mystery to his publisher, then sees the plot occur in real life (with himself as chief suspect, of course). Despite the lack of his presence in the credits, Cornell Woolrich's novels are an obvious influence here - themes of urban paranoia, loss of memory, disconnected characters, etc, were his stock-in-trade. The ripe dialogue borders on self-parody, and the entire exercise could have easily been directed as a satire of the genre. Instead it becomes a double-density noir. Morris and Geray are rather miscast, but peek-a-boo blonde Dowling is striking (particularly visually) as a potential femme fatale. The moody cinematography is engagingly oppressive, lingering on beads of sweat and trapping us in confined spaces. Director Robert Gordon worked mainly in TV and never had much success in film. The \"locked room\" mystery, a staple of the detective novel genre, was most memorably committed to celluloid in the early talkie classic The Kennel Murder Case.",

In 1930 he played opposite 3 very different actresses - Alice White (\"Playing Around\"), Norma Shearer (\"The Divorc\u00e9e\") and Una Merkel (\"The Cat Creeps\") and enhanced all three. Because he had never been typecast he was able to move through the years playing a variety of parts and in the 1940s when actors of his age where looking at character parts, he had his own series in \"Boston Blackie\". \"Blind Spot\" was the last \"stand alone\" movie he made, cushioned between a couple of Boston Blackies, before he conquered television.\n\nWritten by Martin Goldsmith, who wrote both \"Detour\" and \"The Narrow Margin\", it tells the story of Jeffrey Andrews (Morris), a writer down on his luck, who is forced to go to his publisher (who he secretly despises) for money he feels is his due. Small, who doesn't care for Andrews either, tries to convince him to come down off his artistic pedestal and write detective fiction. At the encouragement of Harrison, a popular mystery writer, Andrews outlines a \"locked door\" mystery he has had swimming around in his head. Later, at the bar, he meets Evelyn Green (Constance Dowling) Small's secretary, who comes in disheveled but eager to be friends (now she knows who he is) - she was pretty snooty at the office.\n\nThe next day Andrews is paid a visit by the police - he thinks it is because he drunkenly broke into Small's office and destroyed his contract, but the police are there to charge him with Small's murder. Things look bad - he has been heard telling people in the street about murdering a man in a locked room and the police can't find Evelyn Green. Harrison, who doesn't believe Andrews is guilty, gets the police to release him into his custody but Andrews gives him the slip and tries to revisit everyone, who in his drunken state, he had told the story to - but people have a habit of turning up dead!!!! With a sprinkling of \"Blind Alley\" thrown in Andrews is hypnotised and soon believes he is the killer.\n\nThis is a terrific unknown noir that deserves to be known. Morris is great as Andrews, unshaven and drunk for most of the movie but sobering up fast when he realises he may face the electric chair. Mild looking Steve Geray, who played Harrison, had a distinctive \"Peter Lorre\" like voice. Veronica Lake lookalike Constance Dowling was perfect as the romantic interest who, while her career was pretty lacklustre her private life was anything but. She had an affair with Eli Kazan in the late 1940s and her turbulent affair with Italian poet Cesare Pavese caused him to commit suicide in 1950.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

When the publisher is murdered and later a bartender is killed with her earring found nearby, Morris, who is attracted to her, also suspects her.

That's his \"Blind Spot\".\n\nI watched a 65 minute version of this film noir in a collector's copy, which means the print quality is just OK, like something you would have seen on an old TV show. I'm not complaining because this is a fun movie, although on the talky side, due to budget limitations probably. It has the look and feel of a true noir, and I love the dialog. One can get away with Chandler-esque lines if they are well-written. Morris is just the kind of tough guy, a drinker, unshaven, that the part calls for. And Dowling is just the kind of looker that might be a plus or a minus for him.\n\nThe story juggles several mysteries at once. Did Morris kill the publisher or not? Who killed the bartender? How was the locked room murder accomplished? How can Morris prevent his own arrest when so much evidence points to him? Is Dowling trustworthy or not?\n\nThis movie should be fixed up and released in its entirety on DVD. I think then it will be far more appreciated.

The film is an entertaining low-budget B murder mystery, and Chester Morris and Constance Dowling both overact. Morris especially over-does it as a particularly obnoxious drunk early in the film. This is unfortunate, as the story requires us to have sympathy for him later on, and those who find abusive drunks hard to tolerate will have to be strong. The chief merit of this film is an extraordinarily ingenious twist to the 'murder in a locked room' motif. Several films have been made on the theme: 'how did the murderer escape from the room containing the corpse when the room was locked from the inside?' In this version, however, another ingenious layer is added to the conundrum. Here we have the drunken author (just mentioned) inventing a plot solution for this while he is intoxicated and forgetting it when he has sobered up. However, by that time, someone who heard his idea has actually carried out the clever plan and implicated Morris as the murderer! When Morris tries to track down the people he told the idea to when he was drunk, in the hope that they will remember it and enlighten him, so that he can clear himself of a murder charge, he runs into difficulties. The bartender to whom he told the idea is murdered, to stop him telling the solution of the crime. Those of us who like to solve things will inevitably be interested in this film, and will disregard the inadequacies of the production as being beside the point. Hence, murder mystery fans will find much in this film to intrigue them. And perhaps they will wish, as I found myself doing, that the excellent story idea had been carried out with a better film version, or indeed that someone would remake it and do it properly this time.",

A strange woman appears to tell the group that's spending the night in this house, that the dead woman's spirit lives on in her cat --a black cat, of course. The strange woman hints that the cat, or rather the spirit in the cat, will reveal the killer.\n\nThe story is ludicrous, with dialog to match, but everyone chases one another around the place, and there's enough shootin' and spookin' going on to make this film delightful late-night fare.\n\nLike \"The Cat and the Canary\", this story takes place in a gloomy old home that can only be reached by boat. Also like \"Canary\", all the action takes place during the course of one night, with the killer revealed by sunrise. However, the similarity between the two films ends there. \n\nThis film is short and it's fast.

I first saw this at the age of 12 (when I started to become a fan of this genre) and found some scenes hair-raising. I think this is due to some of the acting and the way some of the action occurs, especially when Mrs. Williams talks about the creeping cat.

The reporter, his photographer friend, the girl, the DA and several other people all end up on the island where the \"mad\" woman lives in a creepy mansion. Murder, mayhem and the search for two hundred thousand dollars ensue.\n\nWell written with some witty dialog, this film falters thanks to Fred Brady as the smart mouthed reporter. Looking like Donald O'Connor, but with little of his charm. While the character as written is an interesting guy, suspicious of everyone and everything, he plays he role so low key as to be almost on the ground. He reads his lines as if he's trying to be in a more serious movie and it upsets the whole tone of the some what tongue in cheek movie since he seems to be in a different movie than everyone else. The film also suffers from being too short at 50 odd minutes for its complicated plot. There are a couple of odd twists that would have made more sense if they had actually set them up instead of spring them on us at the required moment.\n\nNot a bad movie, its actually quite enjoyable, especially if you take it completely on its own terms.

The greedy family surrounding the wealthy old lady are all the typical archetypes, some seemingly noble yet secretly sinister, others obviously there with ulterior motives who are obvious red herrings. One by one, some of the suspects get bumped off too, and each time, the all knowing cat is there to provide a mystery to its purpose.\n\nGiving a hint of the style of Val Lewis who was known for his visits to the dark places of the mind that were far more detailed than the standard Gothic horror. This isn't as spooky, but it is clever, filled with shadows and metaphors and ingenious ways of dramatizing its story. Lois Collier plays the fragile heroine, with Jonathan Hale (Dagwood's boss) as her father. Rose Hobart provides the spookiest performance as Lewis's companion who is petrified of cats, and Douglas Dumbrille is the most seemingly nefarious.

An elderly woman claims that her pet, 'the cat that creeps,' can prove that a 15 year old suicide case was actually murder, with a politician, his daughter, her reporter boyfriend, and the rest show up on Gilligan's Island to solve the mystery (it's that bad). The murder victim is supposed to have hidden 200,000 dollars somewhere, and the creeping cat induces chuckles rather than chills. Clocking in at under an hour, the whole thing just seems endless, a sadly wasted solid cast rushing hither and yon (make that yawn), with Fred Brady quite lacking in the central role that Noah Beery Jr. was far better suited for (he's just the sidekick). Lois Collier, a regular fixture at Universal, made only one additional film for the studio, her screen career over by 1951 (the underused Rose Hobart by 1949). The one character that brings in a little supernatural atmosphere is played by unknown Iris Clive, who totaled only five other features, all Westerns. Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater aired this SHOCK! title an amazing seven times in 13 years, the same number as \"She-Wolf,\" a conspicuous pair of Universal cheats, somehow appropriate for a last gasp lacking even in breath.",

Not only that he wanted \"Lockjaw\" Lockwood to help him get a $3,000.00 loan in order to enter Skipper in the race! Knowing that Skipper doesn't have a chance to win Lockwood guaranteed him the loan but what later happened was far worse that his horse \"Prince of Virginia\" losing to \"Skipper\" in big the race. Lockwood's two beautiful southern belle daughters Joan & Linda, Lynne Carver & Maureen O'Sullivan, fell madly and uncontrollably in love with the handsome brazen and in your face Myles! Which was the worst thing that old man Lockwood could have imagine! The Vanders name is mud in these parts of the state of Virgina in Myles dad stealing \"Lockjaw\" Lockwood's old lady away from him. It was a short time later on their honeymoon the former Mrs. Lockwood ended up perishing together her new husband when the cruse ship they were on was sunk by a possible German U-boat torpedo attack. \n\nLockwood did get a savor of sorts when Joan whom Myles was to marry dumped him for the rich and blue-breaded Ted Milner whom she eloped with to Washington D.C to marry. But it was Old Man Lockwood's second stringed filly, in Myles opinion, Linda who stood by Myles which in the end was to be the person who would be responsible in him winning the Thomas Jefferson Handicap. And thus end up making a fool of her dad Davis \"Lockjaw\" Lockwood. \n\n***SPOILERS*** Before all this happened Myles had some hard times with both his horses \"Skipper\" and the filly \"Sweetheart\" being out of the running. \"Skipper\" was injured during a workout and \"Sweetheart\" killed in a barn fire started by Lockwood's loyal and faithful servant Jeff, Clerence Muse. Jeff in trying to please his master David \"Lockjaw\" Lockwood started an arson fire at Myles' barn that ended up killing two of his horses and could have possibly killed Myles and those who, including Linda, were trying to put it out! Yet there were no charges pressed against Jeff like arson and attempted murder as well as cruelty to animals and he even kept his job as the butler at the Lockwood Estate! You go figure that out! \n\nAnti climactic ending that's been done before and much better in many other horse racing films with Myles' new acquired Philly \"Miss Richmond\" beating Lockwood's prizes horse \"Prince of Virginia\" to the finish line with Linda who was to check out on Myles suddenly changed her mind about him when he went to collated the 20 thousand dollars in winning the race.

Indeed, at first I almost skipped it: The opening scenes with \"Skipper\" Alan Hale are most unpromising.\n\n(All scenes involving him pull the movie down, in fact.) But it is a very sweet tale, once given a chance. Albert plays newspaper clerk Dreamy, who is far too kind and honorable for his own good. The well-being of his charming girlfriend Joan Leslie also suffers.\n\nHe allows his boss to steal his ideas and take credit for them. He helps out any of the downtrodden. Figuring most noticeably in this category is Limpy, the lame newspaper boy, played by Dickie Moore. He and his family are recipients of great, selfless kindness by Dreamy.\n\nIt has a happy ending, though not a typical Hollywood ending: After Dreamy has been recognized for the hero he is, he is given some news that thrills him. Indeed, it could be seen as good news. But his final line is funny,ironic, a bit off-kilter, and very touching.",

Pretty co-worker Joan Leslie (as Mary Clover) is happy, but jealous roommate Alan Hale (as \"Skipper\" Martin) thinks Albert should stop dating Ms. Leslie and save money for his share of their boat. Albert gets into more money problems when he decides to help partially crippled paperboy Dickie Moore (as \"Limpy\" Barnes)...\n\nHoping for a bonus at work, Albert comes up with ideas to boost the circulation of his newspaper, but sneaky John Litel (as John Wade) takes all the credit. Albert gets in more trouble for helping future \"Bowery Boy\" William \"Billy\" Benedict (as Jigs) get a job. As if that wasn't enough, handsome William Lundigan (as Richard Amesworth) moves in on Leslie...\n\n\"The Great Mr. Nobody\" is quite pleasant, with future \"Green Acres\" star Albert shining in a whimsical role. It's interesting to hear Mr. Hale being called \"Skipper\" throughout as he resembles son Alan Hale Jr., familiar as the Skipper on \"Gilligan's Island\" in the 1960s. However, this Hale acts differently (more like a stocky Robert Young). Hale Jr. patterned his skipper after Oliver Hardy. Also interesting is how much you Moore's crippled newsboy resembles \"Captain Marvel Jr.\" from the best selling comic book introduced shortly after this film. The ending is weak, but certainly fit the times.\n\n****** The Great Mr. Nobody (2/15/41) Benjamin Stoloff ~ Eddie Albert, Alan Hale, Joan Leslie, Dickie Moore",

                "text": "Mr. Nobody is an amusing allegory about the effect of different ethical systems. Dreamy Smith represents innocence and good intentions. In his relations to his close friend and love interest Mary Clover we see that his innocence has a downside: she wants to get closer, but he doesn't pick up on her hints. Her intentions are just as good as Dreamy's, but she is not innocent like him. She's constrained by her female social role, but she understands everything that's going on. She can't make a move on Dreamy or at work - she has to play it passive - but she's under no illusions. \n\nWith his innocence comes a power that no other character has: a creative ability to generate ideas that generate value and meaning. \n\nHis boss, John Wade, takes credit for Dreamy's ideas, and doesn't give him the bonus money he deserves. He lies to Dreamy about it, and Dreamy doesn't question him, but Clover tells him to man up.\n\nMeanwhile another character, Dreamy's roommate the Skipper, is trying to use him to buy a boat - the Viking - to go roving the seas. He's not a bad guy, but he is a user. \n\nDreamy gives up his dream of sailing the seven seas to help a poor crippled kid and his family, and he's even willing to give up his love for Mary to get Limpy an operation to fix his foot. \n\nFinally when it seems like Dreamy is toast - his crooked boss Wade fires him from his job after taking credit for all his ideas - Mary steps up and forces Wade to hire him again. It's then that Dreamy commits one more act of senseless generosity: he jumps in the water to save Wade from drowning, though Dreamy can't swim. Wade has to save Dreamy from drowning. \n\nDreamy's good heart compels the people around him to become better themselves. Mary does too, but to a lesser extent. She has to threaten Wade, but Dreamy does it by faith. \n\nThe ending is a little odd: he is given an award for civil courage, and acclaimed by the people who took advantage of him before, and is about to claim Mary as his beloved, when he gets notice that he's been drafted into the army for WWII. Once again he treats it as a privilege - keep in mind this was 1941, and though the US wasn't in yet, it was widely believed that we would have to get involved before it was over.\n\nThe power of Dreamy's innocence and good intentions warps the social network around him to make everyone else better. We see this at the personal level, but the ending sends the message that the US will also do this for global geopolitics by making sure WWII ends with the right side on top.

He sets out to resign his job at a newspaper but his fear brings him back. But even at work, he's not appreciated. \"Seems to me that there's an awful lot of mind reading going on around here\", Albert tells his boss John Litel who seems to rely on his ideas to take credit for. \n\n\"Got any million dollar ideas you want to give away? Tell Mr. Wade!\", girlfriend Joan Leslie tells him, constantly reminding him of the ideas he's constantly giving away. Every time Albert tries to stand up for himself, either his good nature takes over him or somebody tells him he's doing it all wrong. This poor guy can't win, and as much as I like him, I wanted to take him by the shoulders and shake him.\n\nIt's an O.K. comedy with little to recommend past the sitcom standards of the early 1950's and 60's.

Then, there's his fianc\u00e9e Joan Leslie who should be president of a club called \"Future Nags of America\". \n\nJohn Litel is his seemingly decent boss who takes total advantage of Albert's passive nature. Sweet Dickie Moore (just taken from our world a few days before his 90th birthday) is very likable as a handicapped kid who pals around with Albert and really seems to be the only one who respects him. A scene with a beggar being told off by Albert as he hands the poor guy a wad of cash is amusing and very true to life. I've actually seen people do that!\n\nThe problem here is that the script is excruciatingly noisy and there isn't a moment to rest in the film's 70 minute running time.

                "summary": "A star at age 13!",
                "text": "\nThere are some remarkable similarities between Sally Ann Howes and Julie Andrews. Both began their careers as singing ingenues in the same era. Julie's stepfather Ted Andrews was a radio entertainer; Sally Ann's father Bobby Howes starred in West End musicals, playing a character similar to Eddie Cantor's but less brash and more wistful. Sally Ann Howe's most famous film is 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', which is a clear attempt to copy the formula of 'Mary Poppins'.\n\n'Thursday's Child' is Sally Ann Howes's film debut: at age 13, she proves herself an astonishingly accomplished actress of almost supernatural beauty. She is cast here as Fennis Wilson, the younger daughter of a tradesman's family. Her 20-year-old sister Phoebe has ambitions to become a film actress, and wangles an audition at Elstree Studios. As part of a ruse to prevent her mother from chaperoning, Phoebe brings Fennis along to the studio. Meanwhile, Elstree are seeking a child actress to star in 'Strange Barrier' (sounds like a science-fiction film). A casting director (with an annoyingly exaggerated Bow Bells accent) spots Fennis waiting for her sister. He persuades Fennis to read for the role, and ... a star is born!\n\nThis premise might seem unbelievable, were it not for the very real talent of Sally Ann Howes. Fennis is soon offered a contract, at 50 pounds weekly: an astonishing sum for wartime Britain. Fennis's father is a dispensing chemist (a druggist), played by Wilfrid Lawson: there's a very touching scene in which he carefully measures drugs onto his balance scales while pondering the fact that his daughter has a chance to make more money in a few months than his father made in an entire year.\n\nSPOILERS COMING. Frustrated actress Phoebe becomes envious of her younger sister's success. Eventually, Phoebe leaves home ... with no money and no prospects, a vulnerable young woman who will be easy prey for any man on the make. Oddly, this subplot is left unresolved at the end of the film.\n\nStewart Granger is in the cast of this film, but he appears only briefly. Much better here is underrated character actor Anthony Holles as a man who counsels Fennis's mother on the consequences of her daughter's sudden stardom. Gerhard Kempinski (looking amazingly like Danny DeVito) is annoying in a cliched 'funny' foreigner role.\n\nDirector-scenarist Rodney Ackland shows a sure hand with the script. Less happily, his directorial style is distinctive, but not in a favourable way. Ackland has a penchant for tight close-ups of unimportant objects, giving them more significance than they warrant in the script. This is especially blatant during a sequence in the Elstree canteen, when Fennis's mother (Kathleen O'Regan) suddenly encounters an actor wearing monster-movie makeup. We see a tight close-up of actress O'Regan screaming in terror. This would be appropriate in a horror movie or a suspense movie involving genuine menace, but in this context Ackland's penchant for close-ups puts far too much dramatic weight on what's clearly meant to be a comic-relief bit.\n\nThere's one extremely impressive montage sequence in 'Thursday's Child', depicting Fennis's rise to stardom. (Done much better than a similar sequence in 'What Price Hollywood.') I suspect that this montage was shot by a second-unit director, not Ackland.\n\nBIG SPOILER NOW. The film's ending is unexpected but completely welcome. Fennis reads a biography of Marie Curie, and is inspired to give up her acting career to become a research chemist. Ironically, earlier in the film, a press agent tried to ginger-up Fennis's studio biography by stating that her father (a lowly dispensing chemist) is a research chemist (a much more glamorous job). I'm impressed that 'Thursday's Child' tells its young female viewers to aspire to become scientists rather than actresses.\n\nModern audiences might have trouble following some of the wartime references in the dialogue, such as when Phoebe spends her 'coupons' to buy a birthday gift for Fennis. Still, this is an absolutely delightful film, starring a talented actress on the brink of womanhood. I'll rate 'Thursday's Child' 9 points out of 10.\n\n\n",

                "text": "I realize that Sally Ann Howes was only thirteen when this was shot, and that it was her debut on film. But I'm afraid she's terribly scrumptious. Let all men acknowledge the maniac within. \n\nThe director, Rodney Ackland, must know it too because the film opens with a woman who appears to be a housewife, dashing about, straightening things preparatory to a visit from someone important. She rushes to the staircase and shouts for Fennis to hurry up. \"Yes, Mommie,\" and Fennis' long bare legs appear on the screen. That's all we see of Fennis for the moment. Those shapely and exquisitely palpable limbs in very short shorts. Gulp, and then she dashes back upstairs to finish dressing. Now, I ask you -- who's kidding whom? In the very next scene, we have an attractive blond running around, also getting dressed, in lingerie that I don't even have a word for. The top part is like a slip but the bottom part ends in loose shorts. The blond is shapely too. I tell you, it's disgusting. It's prurient. You would never see pretty girls running around in their skivvies in an American movie of the period.\n\nIn a later scene, in the beauty shop where she works, the blond, Phoebe, in a moment of exasperation, at least has the DECENCY to say, \"Oh, heck,\" instead of, \"Oh,\" -- well, something else. As I think the world must know by now, Americans think nothing but morally pure thoughts. And as a man of firm Coptic beliefs, I'm always sure to carry a bible around in my shirt pocket. That bible has stopped two bullets from reaching my body, so far. A rather large medallion of St. Christopher stopped a poison dart in the jungles of Borneo. Damned Wogs.\n\nAnyway, the blond, Phoebe, is dying to get into the movies so she visits the casting director at a studio, taking Howes along with her. The director's Gofer spots Howes in the waiting room and after a brief, rude, appraisal, hustles her in to meet the director. And what a character the director is -- he reclines on a sofa like Nero, he's wildly unkempt, the bit of hair he has is a fright wig, his default expression is revulsion, he has a Hitchcockian figure, and he has Wagner's \"Burgermeister von N\u00fcrnberg\" turned up full blast on the gramophone. When Howes objects that she can't hear anything, the director shouts, \"Turn dzah wecord OVER!\"\n\nThat first scene in the movie, when Ackland shows merely the legs of the principal actress, is not a one-off. The direction is skilled throughout. At one point, in Howes' meeting with the director, the camera focuses on one flabby hand rising slowly and then imperiously flicking its fingers as he orders her out of the room. She's finally hired at fifty pounds a week. Unusual but effective camera angles show up periodically. Howes has some important scenes on that staircase. I'm tempted to read symbolism into it but it's too much trouble.\n\nIt's really a quietly comic film, despite Howes' stuffy and truculent father, Wilfred Lawson, who went on to unforgettable humorous effect in later films like \"Tom Jones\" and \"The Wrong Box,\" in which he was the staggering butler. None of the characters is really \"bad.\" \n\nHowever, there's is some distress generated because Phoebe, Howes' older sister, wanted a part in the movie and didn't get it. Disappointment ensues. The star of the movie condescends to Howes in an insulting manner. Then the studio hypes Howes' \"official biography\" by turning her into a rich girl who rides and owns wolfhounds. Howes is a candid and forthright girl and objects to much of this. Felix Aylmer is the arid studio boss. He runs everything. He hires and fires people. He must be a very agreeable studio head because whatever he says, everyone nearby agrees with him.\n\nThe film turns dramatic towards the end and loses some of its charm. The focus is blurry. Is the old patriarchal system disappearing? Is a woman justified in developing a case of ambition? In any case, the director ends with a choker close up of Howes' smiling, angelic face and she gazes from the train's window on her way to a new life, joyous and unrestrained, at a stern Scottish boarding school.",

He contacts small-time lawyer Edmond O'Brien and hires him as a kind of bodyguard, claiming that his life was threatened by a former business partner, recently released from the slams. Price stages a situation in which O'Brien must shoot and kill the former partner in the belief that it is self defense. The police lieutenant, William Bendix, is skeptical of the entire affair -- and he should be. But he spends the entire movie trying to pin the murders -- there's a later pragmatic murder too -- on O'Brien instead of the smooth Vincent Price.\n\nIt's essentially a B movie plot with some elements, especially in the dialog, that are not exactly witty but at least clever. Some thought went into the writing. The direction of Michael Gordon is pedestrian. There are a few night-time scenes with odd shadows and wet streets but this is not a film noir by any normal definition. It's just a story of murder, theft, intrigue, and romance, with a bit of comic brashness thrown in.\n\nEdmond O'Brien began his career as a handsome young leading man in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" in 1939, opposite the exquisite Maureen O'Hara. Then, immediately afterward it seems, he became flabby without ever becoming genuinely fat. He turned in some nice performances as a dying but still vital man in \"DOA\" and as the somewhat dim-witted Casca in MGM's \"Julius Caesar.\" He was even better as the washed out, blurry, Southern senator in \"Seven Days in May.\" Here, he gets the job done in a professional way.\n\nElla Raines was really beautiful in an entirely conventional way. It was principally her hair that did the job, a cascade of dark and shiny tresses ending with a margin of curls. Any normal man would love to run his toes through it. She seems to have taken some acting lessons from Lauren Bacall's early performances because she's languid and sultry and makes the most of her sex appeal.\n\nVincent Price was an aesthete and a genuinely nice guy, with whom everyone seemed to enjoy working. His role here is liminal -- somewhere between his earnest performances of the mid-40s and the tongue-in-cheek villainy of the 60s. He seems sincerely regretful about the need to kill his loyal and gorgeous secretary.\n\nOverall, it's a success, though a minor one. We pretty much know what the ending will look like, with the snooty Price in chains, and O'Brien and Raines in a final clinch. Bendix mainly abets the romance.",

Universal, who produced this, churned out a number of excellent efforts during the form's heyday \u0096 notably several works by Jules Dassin and Robert Siodmak \u0096 which, this being made by second-tier talent, may explain how it got to be overlooked in the long run! \n\nO'Brien starred in his share of classics \u0096 notably the much-remade THE KILLERS (1946) and D.O.A. (1950) \u0096 and, in fact, when I went through some genre stuff early in the year, I acquired a couple of his lesser vehicles i.e. TWO OF A KIND (1951) and the self-directed SHIELD FOR MURDER (1954), but they ended up not making the list I eventually checked out (my collection of such items having basically gone out-of-hand in the last few years)! Lovely Raines, then, was the quintessential Noir heroine but, like Jane Greer and Audrey Totter (who were more the femme fatale type), she seemed to be out of her element in other genres, so that her career lasted only as long as the field held sway\u0085but, of course, whenever this kind of film is discussed even now, their names inevitably crop up! Typically, Bendix is the cop smelling a rat: though he was a friend of O'Brien's late father, his integrity does not allow him to make it easy for the hero \u0096 especially when the latter becomes the prime suspect of a second murder, which was committed with his gun! \n\nAgain, the climax delivers a real coup as Bendix announces that the latest victim (Price's live-in secretary, played by the sinister-looking John Abbott) is still alive\u0085so that the real culprit is caught red-handed while attempting to finish the 'job', leading to the traditional shoot-out in a darkened room. In spite of the inherent gloom, the film does not entirely eschew humor throughout \u0096 especially when O'Brien confronts Price during a business conference with a bill amounting to peanuts, which is then resumed at the very end, as the hero is about to take what is owed to the former client (whom he had even tried to pass off as an associate of the first murdered party who could incriminate Price \u0096 I did say this was complexly-plotted!) before his current employer is taken away, only to be stopped in the act by Bendix who sarcastically asks him to exercise his official profession of lawyer and sue the man!",

                "text": "Michael Gordon's 'The Web (1947)' is an obscure crime thriller, but you wouldn't have guessed it from the cast list. Edmond O'Brien can always play an unconventional noir hero \u0096 not the sort who is continually in control, but one with a accidental tendency to get into more trouble than he can handle. Vincent Price originally made his name with a string of devious supporting roles in 1940s dramas, including 'Laura (1944)' and 'Dragonwyck (1946).' William Bendix is, of course, a staple of the film noir movement, and here he proves that his range extends beyond playing sadistic brutes and weak-willed buffoons. Femme fatale Ella Raines is less well-known than her co-stars, but, based on this film and her comedic turn in 'The Senator Was Indiscreet (1947),' she had quite a bit of talent. It's not just the cast that is excellent, though. The screenplay by William Bowers and Bertram Millhauser (the latter of whom penned a number of Basil Rathbone's \"Sherlock Holmes\" mysteries) has plenty of unexpected surprises around the corner.\n\nBob Regan (O'Brien) is a two-bit lawyer with the bluster of a high-price attorney. In his first scene, Regan sidles through a busy reception office, offends a secretary (Raines) with some surprisingly-forward sexual banter, before busting in on millionaire businessman Andrew Colby (Price) and demanding the sum of exactly $68.72. Impressed with Regan's passion for the job, Colby hires him for a high-paying, two-week stint as a personal bodyguard. However, when Regan guns down Leopold Kroner (Fritz Leiber), a former associate of Colby's who was recently released from prison, he finds himself in hot water with detective Damico (Bendix), who scents murder. Desperate to clear his name, Regan begins to investigate Colby's shady dealings, reluctantly exploiting the affections of secretary Noel Faraday for information. Meanwhile, Vincent Price's articulate, calculating Colby plots the coup de gr\u00e2ce of his high-stakes crime spree, culminating in a murder frame-up that initially seems so airtight that I couldn't imagine any way for our hero to get out of it.\n\nThough it doesn't necessarily offer any new material for the film noir lexicon, nor does 'The Web' feel contrived. The romance between O'Brien and Raines could easily have been squandered with melodrama, but the film always keeps their relationship edgy. Noel's affections, for one, are clearly split between Regan and Colby, whose association with her visibly extends beyond the professional realm (\"I recognise him when I see him\"). Regan himself, while essentially good-hearted, has a clumsy crudeness about him where women are concerned, in contrast with Colby, who always knows what to say and how to say it. There's something subtly fascinating about Price's 1940s performances; it has to do with how he speaks. When his character is telling an untruth, he does so in a manner that, to us, reeks of deception, and yet we can perfectly understand why the film's characters \u0096 say, a policeman \u0096 swallow the lie whole. He toes a fine line, and yet manages to suspend the audience's disbelief. Maybe that's why Price got away with starring in so many awful movies.",

His first night on the job, O'Brien shoots and kills an intruder, an old associate of Price's just out of prison.  The killing looks suspicious to a street-smart police detective (Bendix), who lacks the evidence to bring a charge.  But when the murdered man's daughter tries to kill him in revenge, O'Brien starts to have second thoughts (\"Was I set up?\"); he also starts to have amorous thoughts about Price's Gal Friday (Raines).\n\nThe performers redeem the run-of-the-mill material.  Price reminds us what a smug villain he could be before horror movies snatched his soul.  For once neither a dim-witted sidekick nor a brute, Bendix convinces us as a shrewd cop.  Raines -- a star in two early Robert Siodmak noirs (Phantom Lady and Uncle Harry) -- leads us to wonder why her career never took flight; sleek, quick and smart, she's every bit as good as her contemporary Lauren Bacall.  Only O'Brien fails to impress; he always plays O'Brien and works better co-starring than in the lead.\n\nLike The Crack-Up and The Unsuspected, TheWeb is a suspense thriller that happens to fall under the influence of the noir cycle that was reaching full speed in 1947.  It's fun, but far from canonical. ",

The Web casts O'Brien as a young attorney and Price as a millionaire who is not above outright criminal activity as a way of supporting his lifestyle as we see.\n\nSad to say the film while not bad in and of itself and its conclusion is quite interesting, it starts with one preposterous premise. O'Brien is rather brash and heavy handed and a bit stupid. Just what Price needs to slip into a neat frame. He hires and O'Brien accepts because business isn't too good a job as a bodyguard because an old business associate played by Fritz Leiber is threatening him.\n\nSure enough Lieber shows up at Price's house and O'Brien shoots him to save Price. The police in the person of William Bendix aren't sure, but they can't prove anything. Later on Price commits another murder and this time he frames both O'Brien and his secretary Ella Raines for the crime. Quite The Web that O'Brien and now Raines are in, in this day we call it a jackpot.\n\nGranted I've known all kinds of lawyers including some of the stupidest people I've ever met. But I could never swallow a street smart guy like O'Brien being so easily manipulated. It prevents The Web from being a truly great noir film.",

This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.\n\nThis is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape. \n\n\"Christmas in Connecticut\" was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. \n\nThe best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong willed women, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as \"Lady Eve\", Ms. Stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in a lot of musical comedies, make a winning combination.\n\nThere are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a delight to watch as the rich, and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an accomplished English actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals.\n\nS. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous mirth; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix,who has a hard time with his own version of the English language. Also, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper in the Sloan perfect Connecticut farm.\n\nIn reading other comments in this forum, it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all, color was not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because, what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them?\n\nThis film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total merriment is assured. Watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see \"Christmas in Connecticut\" every year.",

No masterpiece, but so much better than the weak remake. The whole film revolves around the mistaken belief by editor Greenstreet that Stanwyck (his favorite Martha Stewart-type of writer) is a homemaker with a house, husband and baby in the country. This, of course, means that the inventive woman has to enlist the aid of others to play out her scheme when Greenstreet invites himself and a ship-wrecked sailor (Dennis Morgan) for the holiday week-end.\n\nThe slight comedy develops a few complications along the way--and it all looks very holidayish with the lovely country home in Connecticut--which, thanks to Warner Bros. art decoration, looks like something from a magazine cover. Stanwyck's forte is really heavy drama but here she displays a light enough touch to make her scenes with Morgan and Greenstreet delightful to watch. She gets great support from Una O'Connor, S.Z. Sakall and Reginald Gardiner under Peter Godfrey's light-hearted direction.\n\nIt's as unpretentious a confection as a child's homemade Christmas card and just as charming--light and fluffy entertainment that makes no great demands on your viewing pleasure.

                "text": "\nFrom the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `Christmas In Connecticut,' a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey.  Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular `Martha Stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story.  One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes.  Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed.  Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city.  It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty.  What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm.  Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable.  Even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's Elizabeth you really feel for.  One of the true delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet.  His Yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas.  It's a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it's a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the terrific Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers).  A feel-good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season (though it would work any time of the year), `Christmas In Connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be.  It's a true classic, and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.\n\n\n",

If it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake.\n\nJust as Rock Hudson was a phony fishing expert for Abercrombie&Fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays an forties version of Martha Stewart.\n\nStanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small Connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. Trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But her writing is a hit with the public.\n\nTrouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home Christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. Got to keep up the image at any cost. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner.\n\nSo with borrowed farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner who'd like to make it real with Stanwyck she tries to brazen it through. \n\nChristmas in Connecticut's now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner/friend of Stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and Una O'Connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way.\n\nMost people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few ventures into comedy. If he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is few other things on screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it.\n\nIn a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like Double Indemnity she'd been doing recently. One of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly.\n\nNow if only someone had been filming those numbers.",

She has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. Morgan is the essence of the nice guy. Because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill.

Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance). His best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in \"Christmas In Connecticut\" (although his autocratic, half-mad soap tycoon in \"The Hucksters\" is a close second). Despite some problems with the screenplay, it is a good film, and usually revived in the Christmas season.\n\nElizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in \"American Housekeeping\" magazine for Yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Ms Steward is a cook and house-owner, and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck, but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him.\n\nAs the film begins, an American is shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. Sensing publicity value, Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself (complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks, and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired, as will her immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression she accepts Gardiner's proposal of marriage, and then Gardiner finds his Connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the \"actual\" home of Stanwyck and himself and \"their baby\".\n\nOf course, aside from putting off Greenstreet's meddling curiosity, Stanwyck and Morgan find that they are falling in love (much to the annoyance of Gardiner - he does actually expect that Stanwyck will still marry him). Complication following complication occurs, as lies piles on lies, and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. But it is a comedy, so everything works out well. Even Greenstreet, at the conclusion, is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of Santa Clause for a change. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great one, but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in December.",

The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend \" Uncle\" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.\n\nThings get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas. A scheme is hastily planned, with her stuffy fianc\u00e9 providing an actual Connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications ensue, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa.\n\nThis is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent, aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, S.Z.Sakall, and many others. A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise, for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough, bitchy women in femme fatale roles. Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.",

It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley).\n\nElizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. In reality, she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty of his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, John Sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's.\n\nOf course this scenario makes for much merriment. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and Christmas cookies baking.\n\nWhy did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to. This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street, and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol.",

That film, while the premiere \"film noir\" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman. She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say \"Jingle Bells\". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. \"It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew\". Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, \"Now it's goulash\", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. \"I don't flip. I scoop!\". She won't even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying \"I've never flipped in me life.\" O'Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming.\n\nIt is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but doesn't. But it doesn't matter. The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life.\n\nThis is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, \"Remember the Night\", an underrated gem.

Barbara Stanwyck does her usual professional job as the hard as nails career woman fudging a domestic column for a magazine whose bluff is called in thirties type screwball involving a runaway horse and cow, mixed up babies, Cuddles Szakall stealing the show at every turn with his comic flair and a rural farmhouse which lacks the central iconic focus of every movie advertising the charm of a rural farmhouse - the welcoming, party sized period kitchen. The storyboard is a nonsensical enough fantasy to work yet the editing takes most of the true comic flair out of the film. It seems to me most of the way through as a decent musical with at least Dennis Morgan singing once but not truly a top flight comedy I would even watch a second time.",

It's obvious that the beautifully photographed Barbara Stanwyck is going to fall for and marry serviceman Dennis Morgan.

If I was writing this screenplay, I would be sure to add plenty of humor to Barbara's dialogue.

Instead, she treats him with kid gloves and sucks up to the self-opinionated moron. Why? I'll admit the writer was aware of this problem, so he or she or they paint the Stanwyck character as a liar. And an opportunistic liar at that! One of those liars who will tell you anything either to get out of a scrape or to advance their own career! I'll admit Barbara does her damnedest to soft peddle this aspect, but it's there all the same! In fact, soft peddling is the wrong approach. You make her someone who glories in her lies, not someone who's ashamed of them. That's ridiculous!

                "text": "This is among the more popular \"Christmas\" films, enough to be remade as a 1992 TV-movie directed, of all people, by Arnold Schwarzenegger!). Barbara Stanwyck is also in this one and the difference in studio style (this was made for Warners) and approach from Paramount's REMEMBER THE NIGHT (1940) is immediately apparent: coincidentally, the two have a lot in common, which I was not conscious of before deciding to watch them back-to-back! \n\nBoth films involve deception: here, Stanwyck is ostensibly a famous cook contributing to a top monthly magazine, married with children and living on a Connecticut farm; however, she is none of these things, depending for her recipes on Hungarian chef and restaurateur S.Z. Sakall. So, when the boss decides to pay her a visit, she has to fake her entire lifestyle!. The majority of the proceedings, of course, take place in the country-side \u0096 where the protagonists are involved both with a cow and an involuntary brush with the Law! Incidentally, the male lead (convalescing sailor Dennis Morgan \u0096 in fact, it was jarring to have the film begin inside a German submarine!) was brought to Stanwyck's house over Christmas as a display of solidarity. This was done in order to boost the circulation of the magazine run by \"fat man\" mogul Sydney Greenstreet, here having the time of his life \u0096 so much so that the film ends on him rather than the expected romantic clinch! \u0096 in a role which anticipated his turn in the MGM Clark Gable vehicle THE HUCKSTERS (1947).\n\nTypically, an older man sacrifices himself for love of Stanwyck \u0096 in this case, Reginald Gardiner \u0096 who not only can do nothing to prevent his supposed bride from falling for the dashing young sailor, but he is thrown a bone by the script by making him an innovative architect whose work interests the mogul enough to employ him! In fact, the would-be couple spends a good deal of time trying to organize a hasty wedding ceremony, with the presiding Justice Of The Peace forever being hidden in the back-room or else coming and going for another stab at the nuptials, naturally all of this taking place behind Greenstreet's back\u0085but, conveniently, they never actually manage it! Other complications see a couple of different babies involved (local kids being babysit by Irish maid Una O'Connor, and whose obvious difference in age and sex leaves Greenstreet befuddled: when he spies one of the mothers coming to pick her toddler up, he creates a panic by calling cops and reporters in the mistaken belief that a kidnapping had occurred!) and the arrival upon the scene of the sailor's nurse, whom he has had to bribe with a promise to wed her in order to get some decent food at the hospital. Incidentally, Stanwyck has to constantly improvise so as to ditch her boss' wish to see her cook or feed the child (relegating the former chore to either Sakall or O'Connor and the latter to Morgan himself, who is all-too-happy to be of help).\n\nAs I said, the two leads soon realize they harbor affections for one another but cannot bring themselves to admit it, both believing the other is already spoken for! Even if there is little chemistry between Stanwyck and Morgan (unlike Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in the afore-mentioned REMEMBER THE NIGHT) and the nominal star's career had just peaked with DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944; with MacMurray again!), the film is a very pleasant diversion which, as already intimated, results in being more palatable than the somewhat similar Preston Sturges/Mitchell Leisen confection simply because the two films seem to have swapped styles: while I expected the 1940 effort to be sophisticated and breezy while this ought to have been bland and syrupy, it proved agreeably zany whereas REMEMBER THE NIGHT emerged to be incongruously serious and downright sentimental!",

Dennis Morgan plays Jefferson Jones, a war hero who is keen to feel just what a traditional home should feel like, and Elizabeth's boss (Alexander Yardley, played by Sydney Greenstreet) arranges for the both of them to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family on the farm for Christmas. One small problem - Elizabeth DOESN'T live on a Connecticut farm, she has no husband, has no child and has no talent when it comes to cooking meals (she gets all of her amazing recipes from her friend Felix, played by S. Z. Sakall). Obviously, it's going to be a big job to survive the holiday season.\n\nDirected by Peter Godfrey, and with a cracking script by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini (based on a story by Aileen Hamilton), Christmas In Connecticut starts off by delivering a message of seasonal cheer to the audience and then backs that up with almost every moment of the film's runtime.\n\nThe cast are all pretty good, with only Reginald Gardiner (as John Sloan, a rather dull architect who helps Elizabeth by letting her into his Connecticut house and arranging to marry her - he even has a baby or two available) being a bit of a damp squib. That's probably as much due to his boring character as it is to the acting but I was always eager to get back to any scenes involving Stanwyck, Morgan, Greenstreet or, especially, Sakall. Even Una O'Connor, an actress I have sometimes found more irritating than amusing, was great fun in this frothy farce.\n\nYou never really worry that things aren't going to turn out as they should (signposted by a couple of gratuities) and the stress level never overshadows the constant amusement but that's why this is so endearing. It sets out to be a pleasant, entertaining, Christmas comedy and with some great scenes here and there, great characters, some fun lines and plenty of snow, well, that's exactly what it IS.",

Finding instant relief in this 1945 screwball farce that has since become a holiday TV staple, she plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular homemaking magazine writer who doles out Martha Stewart-type cooking advice to the unsuspecting masses who haven't a clue that she's really a lonely working girl who lives in a cold-water Manhattan flat. Things get immediately complicated when her demanding publisher Alexander Yardley, desperate for a boost in circulation, insists that she entertain a wounded soldier who fantasized about her bountiful dishes out in the Pacific. The problem is compounded by the fact that she has completely fabricated her life of domestic bliss on a Connecticut farm where she is supposed to be happily married with a baby.\n\nYardley is not aware of her web of deception, so Elizabeth uses the luxuriant farm owned by her paramour wannabe, John Sloan, whom she agrees to marry in return even though she doesn't love him. She convinces her best friend Felix, a first-class Hungarian chef who has been plying her with his recipes, to come to the farm to give her a crash cooking course. Needless to say, bedlam ensues when the soldier, Jefferson Jones, shows up at the farm two hours early, but of course, so does romance eventually at a local dance and then on a most romantic sleigh ride. Love and truth eventually sort themselves out at the end. In a strange way, one could look at this holiday rom-com as the flip side to \"Double Indemnity\" since both revolve around the concept of a woman fooling others to get her way, but this time, she's a single gal who wants a husband instead of a married one who wants to dispose of one. Directed by Warner Bros. studio journeyman Peter Godfrey and co-written by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini, the film lacks a certain finesse that an Ernst Lubitsch (\"The Shop Around the Corner\") would have provided in spades.\n\nWhat's more, the initial set-up feels tacked-on with the food-fantasizing Jones first on a life raft with a fellow soldier, then getting rescued, and gradually recovering in the hospital. It runs perilously close to a half-hour before we even get a glimpse of Stanwyck's character. That's a bit of a shame since she's terrifically likable and a game farceur in her typical no-nonsense way. A studio favorite at the time, former band singer Dennis Morgan (\"In This Our Life\") plays the smitten Jones well enough in an undemanding role. The usually menacing Sydney Greenstreet (\"The Maltese Falcon\") has a good time playing the pompous Yardley, and the unforgettable S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakall (\"Casablanca\") lives up to his name as Felix. Memorable as the Southern-fried, skirt-blowing chanteuse in \"The Awful Truth\", Joyce Compton plays the nurse who attempts to entrap the food-desperate Jones into marriage. The 2005 DVD includes the original theatrical trailer and an Oscar-winning short, \"Star in the Night\", a then-contemporary retelling of the Nativity story set in the Southwest desert.",

Her publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, unaware of the truth, is a man who likes the image that she uses because it appeals to his readership and sells newspapers; however, he too is seduced by the image and invites himself to spend a Christmas in Connecticut to enjoy the pleasures of a New England country Christmas. He is joined by Dennis Morgan, home from the war, where he was just rescued at sea. This is where the plot becomes complicated for Stanwyck and her male friend, Reginald Gardiner, who poses as her husband.

As far as her readership is aware, Elizabeth lives in domestic bliss out in the country, tending the family home for her husband whilst raising their bonnie baby. The truth, however, is that she doesn't do any of those things, in fact she's hopeless and lives on her own in a modest Manhattan apartment.

Roping in some friends she hatches a plan to not get found out, but it's not going to be easy to pull off, no sir, not easy at all.\n\nFrothy and breezy slice of screwball that does a good enough job at yuletide without really breaking out of its routine chains. Stanwyck is excellent (in a role first offered to Bette Davis), managing to keep the audience on Elizabeth's side in spite of her less than stellar scruples. There's a number of enjoyable set pieces, and enough knock about energy to raise a few laughs. While the makers have nicely played around with the myth of a domestic goddess and the expectation of such from male suitors. The trouble with the film, mainly, is that the direction is not creative enough for the complexities of the story, the deceptions at its core soon become boorish due to overkill. Sure it's lively, but running thru a number of set ups at pace is not enough if the staid dialogue and predictability of it all hangs heavy. One can imagine just what Howard Hawks could have done with this set up. Still, it's a safe recommendation at Christmas time, and certainly a must see for fans of the versatile Stanwyck. But once the end credits have rolled it ultimately feels like a Christmas tree without the trimmings. 6/10",

                "text": "I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show \"The Big Valley\". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.\n\nAnd so it was for \"Christmas in Connecticut\" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas. It does, however, have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin, the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (S.Z.Sakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Regardless, they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind.\n\nAt this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha,ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after.\n\nI watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew.",

The selling point in my case was The Shop Around The Corner, which I have seen several times on TV but never owned and the set also boasted three other titles that were either new to me (It Happened on Fifth Avenue) or titles of which I'd heard of but hadn't seen, like this one. Okay the leading man was something of an acting joke, wooden as both Punch and Judy combined, but Barbara Stanwych seldom lets you down and if she was having an off-day here (she wasn't) Sydney Greenstreet, S. Z. Zackall, Regineld Gardiner and Una O'Connor were running interference and there was no way they could all be lousy at the same time. The premise was that Stanwyck plays a character based loosely upon Gladys Taber who, for several decades wrote a column in Family Circle in which she did little more than chat in a homely way - and/or dispensed 'Butternut Wisdom' about her farm in Connecticut, lacing the text with recipes, gardening tips etc. The twist in the film is that Stanwyck writes her column from Manhattan, couldn't boil water without burning it, would require an illustrated recipe to make toast and relies on the expertise of restaurateur Zackall to provide the cooking tips/recipes. She's doing all right if anybody asks you until the owner of the magazine, Greenstreet, decides not only to spend Christmas on the fictitious Stanwyck farm but also to bring war hero Morgan to supply the human interest angle. Luckily Regineld Gardiner, who has been pursuing Stanwyck unsuccessfully for years, just happens to have a farm in Connecticut which he is prepared to 'lend' Stanwyck should she agree to marry him, and naturally there is room also for Zackall to do the cooking. Now, of course, it's just a matter of waiting to see how long Stanwyck can keep the balls in the air, or how many near-misses she can survive. There's a lot of charm at work here and it's sobering to think that in 1945 this could have easily got lost in the shuffle at a time when they were churning out stuff like this at the rate of half a dozen a year whilst today it beckons like an oasis in a desert of mediocrity.

The real cook with all the gourmet dishes isn't Stanwyck but SZ Sakall from Budapest who is fortunate enough to benefit from her fame. Sakall will accompany her to a farm supplied by architect Reginald Gardiner (he is always habitually asking Stanwyck to marry him) if Stanwyck will marry him. Reluctantly, she will but her betrothal to Gardiner keeps getting delayed by Sakall who knows she doesn't love him. The child is brought by to be babysat by a mother who works at the war factory (female one day, but the next is a different worker with a male baby!), so Stanwyck (who doesn't know a thing about being a mother) must wing it, aided (much to her delight) by Morgan (he grew up with children and knows how to bath and feed them). The problem that arises for Stanwyck is that she falls head-over-heels for Morgan and must somehow steer her affections/lust for him away and focus on successfully fooling Greenstreet into believing she is actually exactly as she claims. The whole comic angle is Stanwyck masterminding this grand charade even as her behavior and heart yearn for Morgan. Greenstreet expects what he reads in her articles to be articulated in person and Stanwyck must find ways to escape. This is designed like a screwball comedy or something you might see from Preston Sturges. There's constant activity, evasive maneuvers, close-calls, daunting tasks demanding think-on-your-feet (or just plain luck) responses, lots of wooing and romanticizing, and unexpected developments (baby is \"kidnapped\" by his actual mom much to Greenstreet's dismay; the male-female baby change; Greenstreet expecting Stanwyck to \"skillet a flapjack\" in his presence; the \"theft\" of a horse carriage that lands Morgan and Stanwyck temporarily under arrest) that complicate matters further. Stanwyck had a magnetic screen presence even in films like this that feel like holiday, feel-good fodder, perhaps considered a notch or two behind the Lady Eves and Ball of Fires, but I thought \"Christmas in Connecticut\" would be easy to go down with some eggnog and cookies. It has that holiday atmosphere (the farm is idyllic and snowy, the house is elegant, there's the decoration of the gigantic Christmas tree, the piano-played carol, and the cast are breezy and fun to watch). When you are needing something Christmassy for a night in December, this is as entertaining a film as I could recommend\u0085it has all the ingredients without schmaltz or melodramatics.",

It is called a \"B movie,\" the companion in a double feature to the movie people were actually willing to pay money for. You didn't worry over little details like making the story believable; these stories exist in an alternative B movie universe.\n\nAnd so we see in the opening two sailors adrift for 16 days. The nurse says they were without food for 16 days, yet in the next breath she talks about how they had K rations, up to some point. Jeff gave his companion the last of the K rations, and now he is being kept off solid food for 18 days, while his buddy has been feasting on steak and turkey for days. Does this make sense? So how does the Nurse Sadist console him? She reads him a magazine article about a seven-course meal, complete with roast duck, after serving him warm milk and a raw egg! In my universe, he would have strangled her, but in the B universe, the sailor pretends to fall in love with Nurse Sadist.\n\n(Now, in reality, when liberating Nazi concentration camps, doctors found that if starving inmates were fed high protein food right off, they died because the kidneys were overloaded. So they started them out on a light broth, etc., for a couple of days.) \n\nAnd these are the problems with just the first six minutes of the movie. By eight minutes, the nurse is ready to marry him and is bringing him steak, and all he did was say her name and that he missed her. Now, why didn't any of the other dozens of sailors in the ward think of that with such a dumb blond (she can't even win at tic tack toe)? Sure, you've got to be willing to suspend disbelief, but for an old B movie, this is easier if you aren't exactly paying attention to the movie, if you know what I mean. In the year 2013, what this means is this is a chick flick, a suitably romantic movie to watch with a brainless girlfriend.\n\nAt 12 minutes, just when many in the theater are about to put on their coats, Sidney Greenstreet appears, and the plot thankfully thickens. At 14 minutes, we have two more stars, and the first of two black actors in small but non-stereotyped roles.\n\nWe are beginning to see the DNA of this Christmas movie: a Warner Bros. picture, the rebel outfit. Underlying the story are jabs at more conventional movies like Holiday Inn - 1942, also set on a farm in Connecticut, and Meet John Doe - 1941, A Frank Capra flick which also features Barbara Stanwyck as a mink coat wearing reporter who concocts bogus stories. And there is a jab at a real life food writer, Gladys Taber.\n\nThis is what people watched before TV, and after, for the B movie became the basis for brainless sitcoms; from these humble roots sprung such masterpieces as I Remember Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Islands. Perhaps that's why this storyline seems so hackneyed: 60 subsequent years of TV sitcoms. \n\nRealty? A most inconvenient distraction. Call me old fashioned, but I believe there should be some sort of internal logic to a movie's plot. In Christmas in Connecticut, there's none. Things just happen, mostly for the convenience of the lazy writers, especially the ending. (Spoiler alert) It makes no sense, but everyone seems to be happy, or at least relieved, as far as I can tell. It is a bit confusing because the writers just tie up a bunch of loose ends with some very fast dialog - The End. \n\nHey, if you enjoyed the movie, if it made your Christmas merrier, that's great.\n\nBut if you've never seen this movie, you haven't missed anything. And aside from the fact that they say it is Christmas, there is nothing particularly Christmassy about this movie. Heck, it came out on August 11, four days before the Japanese surrender. Actually, this is a bit odd, when you think about it. Until they dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, it looked like the war would run another year or two. With the war over, showing this movie in Dec. 1945 would seem dated, especially as people would be tired of thinking about it. Just another of many elements about this movie that don't quite fit.",

Unfortunately, the last line just didn't quite capture my feelings about the movie.\n\nIt's not that this is a bad movie. Quite the contrary - it's a very pleasant seasonal film, but that may be its biggest problem. It's up against some pretty stiff competition in terms of Christmas films, and there was nothing in particular about this that would make me want to watch it again and again. We have certain holiday traditions in our home, some of which do revolve around watching certain movies. \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Miracle On 34th Street,\" \"It's A Wonderful Life.\" They're all annual events. Even a more recent piece of comedy such as \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" shows up in our house every year. \"Christmas In Connecticut\" was fun to watch once, but I can't see doing it every year.\n\nThe story had the potential to be funnier than it turned out to be. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) is a magazine columnist, who offers cooking and homemaking tips from the perspective of her life as a wife and mother on a Connecticut farm. The problem is that she has no kids, she isn't married and she lives in an apartment in the city. Everything about her column is a lie, but her boss Yardley doesn't know that, and he arranges to have a sailor who spent 18 days in a life raft after his boat was shot out from under him (Jeff Jones, played by Dennis Morgan) spend Christmas with Lane and her \"family\" so that he can experience a real family Christmas. How to pull this off without Yardley figuring out the truth becomes the plot.\n\nIt's mildly funny, and Stanwyck and Morgan had a great chemistry. I also enjoyed the performances from S.Z. Sakall as Felix and Una O'Connor as Nora, and spent at least part of the movie wondering if those two would hook up. There's nothing really wrong with this, except possibly to note that at the very beginning of the film Jones and his buddy look awfully healthy for two guys who had been stuck in a life raft all that time!

The stories remain virtually unchanged, but the cast, script and sets change. The most obvious of these is Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol.\" That literary and holiday classic lends itself very well to new productions, much like the works of Shakespeare. \n\nOn the other hand, some specific movies have become favorite classics or are so part of our annual traditions that the casts have become ingrained in the stories. One can't see anyone else playing certain roles. One of the most obvious of these is Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" We can't imagine anyone other than James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers playing the roles they had in that film. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is another such film.\n\nAlthough it hasn't reached the stature of Wonderful Life, this film has become a holiday classic as well. It is a favorite of mine. Those of us who have seen it a number of times over the years can't imagine anyone other than those in its cast playing the roles in the film. Barbara Stanwyck is Elizabeth Lane, Dennis Morgan is Jefferson Jones, Sydney Greenstreet is Alexander Yardley, S.Z. 'Chuckles' Sakall is Uncle Felix, and Reginald Gardiner is John Sloan. Even beyond the main cast, some supporting actors are so good and right for their roles, that they have become 'ingrained' in the parts. These include Una O'Connor as Norah, Dick Elliott as Judge Crothers, and Robert Shayne as Dudley Beecham. \n\nThis movie came out less than a month before Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. It was nearly 1 \u00bd years ahead of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" There are no war scenes in \"Christmas in Connecticut,\" but the war had a strong influence and part in the plot of the film. The war that had ended had nothing to do with the plot of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" While both films have Christmas settings, their stories and intended audiences are quite different. \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is all family entertainment, with strong seasonal appeal to children as well as adults and strong moral and human overtones. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a very good romantic comedy that is adult all the way. It's approved viewing for children as well \u0096 very clean and proper. But the humorous script and sequences are written for adults. It doesn't have tremendously clever dialog with witty wisecracks and comebacks. Rather, it has clever lines that fit visual situations. \n\nThe film has some hilarious sequences. Watch for Uncle Felix, Elizabeth and Sloan at the buffet table in the restaurant. Another is at Alexander Yardley's home, between him and Elizabeth \u0096 and then the butler and Elizabeth. Judge Crothers pops in and out of scenes in a funny sort of cat-and-mouse series of scenes. Then there's the Connecticut square dance. And Yardley's dialog with Sloan about the former's ability to detect lies and fraud. The farm cow plays in another humorous sequence. Elizabeth and Jones have a wonderful sequence, warm and funny, with the baby. Later, the baby switches lead to all sorts of mayhem and humor. There are more, from the opening scenes of two sailors adrift after their ship is torpedoed, to the very end. \n\nI noted some reviewers thought the plot was too contrived or silly. I think it's an excellent plot, very well contrived, with several specific twists that fit together perfectly to make it work. This is not an uproariously funny film. It's a warm, entertaining romantic comedy. Its turns with the truth, marriage, fidelity and other virtues are obvious to an adult audience. So, we don't take them as serious but as part of the humor of the plot. \n\nNor is this a film of funny characters. Stanwyck, Greenstreet and Morgan are mostly straight characters, although Greenstreet has some very humorous dialog in a couple places. The only standout humorous role is that of Uncle Felix. To a lesser degree, Norah and Dud are comedic roles. The comedy is mostly in the lines of these three characters, and in the physical responses and scenes with the others. To that extent, Stanwyck and Greenstreet are especially good in their straight roles that lend to the comedy. Greenstreet is a riot as the prudent overseer of morals and propriety of his columnist employee, Elizabeth. \n\nThis is a most enjoyable film. Its transparent plot seems very straightforward. Yet I seem to discover something new to enjoy each time I watch this movie. I heartily recommend it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. One viewing should suffice to make it a part of your annual Christmas holidays list.\n\nHere are a few snippets of the fun and funny dialog that I enjoy. Elizabeth, \"Dud, we're going to be married.\" Dud, \"What?

Actually the cast does quite a good job with the lines they have to deliver but most of the plot points elicit groans rather than guffaws.

            "Journalist Elizabeth Lane is one of the country's most famous food writers. In her columns, she describes herself as a hard working farm woman, taking care of her children and being an excellent cook. But this is all lies. In reality she is an unmarried New Yorker who can't even boil an egg. The recipes come from her good friend Felix. The owner of the magazine she works for has decided that a heroic sailor will spend his Christmas on *her* farm. Miss Lane knows that her career is over if the truth comes out, but what can she do?",
            "In her Smart Housekeeping column, Elizabeth Lane provides amazing recipes and homemaking hints. However, Elizabeth's got a little secret: SHE needs a recipe to boil water! Elizabeth has no cooking skills, no Connecticut farm, no adoring hubby and no baby-makes-three as suggested in her column. Something her boss, the magazine publisher, doesn't know when he decides to invite himself and a recently returned war hero to her home for a traditional family Christmas. Watch as Elizabeth tries to be a good wife and doting mother, with absolutely NO experience.",
            "The destroyer of Jefferson Jones and his partner Sinkewicz is sunk by the Germans and they float adrift in a raft for eighteen days. When they are rescued, they are sent to a hospital and Jefferson has to follow a stringent diet imposed by the doctors. He seduces his nurse expecting to get solid food and she decides to write to Alexander Yardley, who is the owner of the Smart Housekeeping magazine where the famous journalist Elizabeth Lane writes a column about recipes and food, asking him to allow Jefferson to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family in her farm in Connecticut. The prepotent Yardley sees the chance of free promotion of his magazine and forces Elizabeth to invite the hero Jones. However, Elizabeth is single, does not have a baby and lives alone in a small apartment in New York and she made-up a perfect married life for her fans. Further, she does not how to cook and the recipes belong to her Hungarian friend Felix Bassenak, who owns a restaurant in New York. The architect John Sloan, who has been wooing Elizabeth for a long, proposes to marry her in his farm in Connecticut and she brings Felix with her to help to proceed the farce. The things get complicated when Yardley also decides to spend Christmas with Elizabeth while she falls in love with Jones.",
            "Elizabeth Lane is the perfect homemaker in so many ways. She's an outstanding cook and interior decorator who lives in a beautiful house in the countryside, is happily married and recently had a baby - as her regular column in Smart Housekeeping magazine recounts to her wide readership. There's only one big catch: she isn't any of those things - she can't cook, doesn't know the first thing about decorating and lives in a tiny, dingy apartment. It all begins to unravel when her publisher, Alexander Yardley, arranges for recently rescued sailor Jefferson Jones to spend the weekend at Lane's country home. To top it off, Yardley invites himself to spend the weekend there as well. Elizabeth scrambles, getting her friend Felix Bassenak to cook for her and borrows her friend John Sloan's country house. She even gets a baby from a neighbor. As if she doesn't have enough to deal with, she and Jones become quite attracted to one another. Somehow it all works out in the end.",
            "Featured in Smart Housekeeping magazine, domestic goddess Elizabeth Lane's column, which focuses primarily on food and which is the most popular column of its kind in the country, is an account of her perfect domestic life as wife and new mother living on a rural Connecticut property. However, it is all a sham as Liz is single, lives in a small New York City apartment, and doesn't know how to cook, she using her Uncle Fritz Bassenak, a chef and restaurateur, as her source for the food items, and her long time suitor, architect John Sloan, who owns a Connecticut farm, as the source of the stories of rural Connecticut life. A problem arises for Liz and by association her editor, Dudley Beecham, who knows the truth about Liz, when their publisher, Alexander Yardley, who values truth above all else, asks Liz to host a Connecticut Christmas dinner for himself and war hero Jefferson Jones. Jeff is one of the few survivors of a bombed destroyer. Spending eighteen days on a life raft, he dreamed more about good food than anything during those eighteen days. His naval hospital nurse, Mary Lee, who he feigned to love just to get that food against doctor's orders, believes that Jeff, who has never had a supportive home life, has to experience such to get him to marry her, which resulted in the request to Liz via Yardley. It isn't until after Liz agrees to marry John, who she does not love but can no longer use the excuse of her flourishing writing career not to marry as she is sure Yardley will fire her once he knows the truth, that Dudley comes up with the idea to use John's Connecticut house and Felix's behind the scenes cooking prowess to host that Christmas dinner in Connecticut, complete with a borrowed baby. All the parties in the know agree. Complications ensue when Liz, John and Felix try to keep the truth from Jeff and Yardley, that truth which includes Judge Crowthers, who is to officiate Liz and John's wedding and who they have to hide physically whenever he is at the farm in order to marry them. But the biggest complication is that Liz and Jeff fall in love at first sight, Jeff whose love may wane if he learns that Liz is not all she appears on the surface."

                "text": "The film has two main themes. A world-famous aviator (Dix) has slowly destroyed his once amazing career and he has his pilot's license revoked for being drunk in the cockpit. The film is about his rebuilding his life, though through very long stretches of the film he is absent or practically absent as the second plot took precedence during most of the film. A small aircraft manufacturer is trying to design a fighter plane in order to win a lucrative government contract. So much of the film concerns the struggles they go through as well as a budding relationship that never seems to get off the ground between the project manager and a female draftsman.\n\nAs far as the plane goes, I know most who see the film won't notice some of the problems with how they executed the flying sequences and the plane itself. While the plane is supposed to be \"the latest thing\" and capable of flying over 400 m.p.h., the design is actually similar to experimental craft being produced from 1932-1936 (looking a lot like the airplane used in the old Universal Studios intros), so in so many ways the craft was totally obsolete. This isn't a real issue for the average person, but hey, for us aviation buffs it is noticeable. But what IS noticeable even for the casual viewer are the silly physics of the plane as it flies. It's very obviously a model and it executes turns that no plane EVER could make--making the tiniest loop-to-loops and spins in history! A little more money and effort could have made for much more realistic and less silly flying sequences. However, even despite these problems, the movie is about a seldom discussed topic and I found it very interesting from a historical standpoint.\n\nAs for me, personally, I would score this movie a 6 or 7, since I am a huge fan of the history of aviation and am a school teacher. However, I also understand that for the average viewer, this film will no doubt be pretty dull stuff and provide little entertainment. Also, as far as a the romance goes, it never really made much sense and never seemed to get past minor infatuation. Plus, for fans of Richard Dix (and there must be a few out there), his role in the film is pretty small and not especially heroic--despite him receiving top billing.",

I assume the shots in the film were taken during the testing of the H-1 five years earlier. That plane is now in the Smithsonian. I was surprised that no mention of this use ever came out during the publicity for the Hughes Biopic, The Aviator. Men Against the Sky was an RKO picture, and I think Howard Hughes was connected the that studio. There was no mention of Hughes in the closing credits of the film.

The romance is mainly between engineer Kent Taylor and the plane, although Wendy Barrie does her best to divert him to romance with her. Another aspect of the romance with the air is the romance with flying itself. That part goes to Richard Dix as a pilot and stunt flyer who has fallen on hard times. He's Barrie's brother, however, and makes a comeback in the shakedown phase of the new aircraft. A third element that comes into play is finance. This part reminds me of the Charlie Parker song \"Romance without Finance\" is a nuisance, baby. Edmund Lowe handles the business end and has to obtain the finance to build the new plane. The banks won't tumble to the idea because he's losing money in his current company, but a venture capitalist comes his way and offers cash on a highly levered basis, with Lowe putting up his business and home as collateral.\n\nThe cast is lively and carries the film along. The film is lively with an element of infectious enthusiasm. It has a modicum of suspense. It's predictable but not too predictable. Setbacks are leavened with comedy that's held within bounds. The models used to depict the new plane are obvious and their violation of physical laws is a joke. The film does much better when it uses actual airplanes.\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable outing for us fans of old movies.",

Tex Roberts (Tex Ritter) and his pal Slim Hunkafeller (Slim Andrews) strike a pay vein and find themselves marked as the gang's next victims. The real head of the gang, fearing that Tex will find him out, decides to get him out of the way by planting false evidence against him, and thus diverting attention from himself. As a result, Sheriff Bat Toles (Gene Alsace) jails Tex, but the outlaws are worried he might escape and dynamite the jail. This best laid plan goes awry as Tex, instead of being killed, does escape. Running from the posse, Tex hides in a cave where Bill Rawls ('Forest Taylor (I)'), a victim of the gang who got away unknown to them. is also hiding as he waits to get revenge. Rawls thinks, as the other miners do, that Tex is gang leader Ceegareet, until Tex persuades him to return to Boom Town. There, Rawls sees the real leader of the killers and identifies him as Prader (Stanley Price), the saloon owner. Rawls also finds his daughter, Chita (Inna Gest), who has been working as a dance hall entertainer while searching for him. Tex rescues Chita and Patsy (Patsy Moran), another entertainer, and roundups up Ceegareet, henchmen Chris (Warner Richmond) and \"Morg\" Morgan (Chuck Morrison) and the rest of the gang.",

To finish him off they blow up the jail. But this frees Tex and Slim and they head out to find the real killer."

In this one, the hero is an investigator sent by the U.S. Army rather than the Texas Rangers, but the roots show quickly. During the Civil War, Union Army Lieutenant Steve Nolan and Corporal Banjo Bonner are assigned to trail and capture \"El Vengador/The Avenger\", outlaw leader whose band is stealing herds of wild horses before they can be delivered on contract to the Army. Disguised as an unshaven, seedy cowpuncher, Steve arrives in Benton, Oklahoma territory and witnesses the robbery of the post office by Duggan and Higgins, henchmen of Arnold Drew, who holds the contract to deliver the horses. Steve stops the two robbers but is wounded by the unseen Drew. The townspeople assume the unconscious Steve is part of the gang, and judge Clem Masters instructs a deputy to take Steve to the next town to have his head-wound treated. Drew orders Duggan and Higgins to ambush the wagon and kill Steve, but they shoot the deputy instead, and the team runs away with the helpless Steve. He is dumped over an embankment just as Donna Ross, Todd Wingate and Boone Talbot arrive on the scene. Donna takes Steve to a hideout in the mountains, where she is revealed as El Vengador, leading a group of dispossessed ranchers against Drew and land agent James Prescott, who have illegally taken over the rancher's lands, so they can take over the contract of furnishing the horses. Steve is nursed back to health by Donna and returns clean-shaven to Benton to gather evidence against the Drew/Prescott gang, but Donna and Todd think he is a spy who has betrayed them."

However, I cheered up a bit when I saw that the director was William Nigh who had done the fine \"Mr Wong\" detective series and the excellent spy drama \"British Intelligence,\" both with Boris Karloff.\n\nThe movie starts out with a very long and talky scene of the District Attorney George Lane (Lester Matthews) telling gangster Brad McArthur (John Carroll) that he was going to clean up the city by getting him. McArthur says that he's a rich businessman who employs a lot of people and has a lot of friends. I like a film that lays its cards on the table. I expected the film to be a battle of wills and guns between the D.A. and the criminal.\n\nSurprisingly, this turns out to be a subplot. The real plot develops when McArthur meets newspaperboy and street urchin Bobby (Martin Spellman). Bobby is an orphan, living alone, making $4 a week. McArthur offers him $6 a week to come work for him. McArthur wants to use Bobby to establish a clean image. The rest of the movie is really about the bonding of McArthur and Bobby.\n\nYour reaction to the movie will hinge on your reaction to Martin Spellman's portrayal of young Bobby. If you find him adorable and sweet, you will probably like the movie. If you find him sugary, overacting, and annoying, you'll hate it. Martin did go on to appear in \"A\" pictures,\"Beau Geste\" and \"Let Us Live\" (starting Maureen O'Sullivan and Henry Fonda). His career consisted of about a dozen films that he did between the ages of 13 and 16. Based on this picture, one would have expected him to become a star or at least a good character actor.\n\nJohn Carroll gives a nice, laid-back performance as the gangster. He never became a big star, but he had some good parts in some \"A\" pictures, including \"Susan and God\" (Joan Crawford and Fredric March) and \"Go West\" (The Marx Brothers) This is a cute and sweet film in the kid-turns-bachelor's-life-upside-down mold. If you're looking for a real tough gangster flick, run away quick.\n\nThe film is hindered by its low budget sets and obviously quick production schedule which seems to have forced a many scenes to be done in long takes. I suspect they only had a five or six day shooting schedule. Still director Nigh is a good story-teller and makes a very pedestrian comic melodrama fun to watch.",

In 1933, John Wayne, a struggling B actor, was working in serials for Mascot Pictures, the forerunner to Republic. The Three Musketeers was an updated version of Dumas' adventure classic using Foreign Legionnaires instead of royal swordsmen. The serial was the third of three chapter-plays Wayne made at this time. In 1946, he had become a major star, producing his own films at Republic. Desert Command was designed to play the bottom half of a double bill at second run theaters at a Saturday matin\u00e9e, where a Roy Rogers or Gene Autry film might be the main feature. Autry had also appeared in a sci-fi western serial for Mascot, \"Phantom Empire\" which was re-edited into a 1940 feature, \"Men With Steel Faces.\" Other Republic serials re-edited as features included \"Hi-Yo Silver\" (The Lone Ranger, 1938), Lost Planet Airmen (King of the Rocketmen, 1949), and Zorro Rides Again (same title as 1937 serial). In 1966, to cash in on the Batman \"camp\" craze, Republic re-released several of their serials as features under different titles for television in the \"Century 66\" package.",

                "text": "It's interesting that \"Desert Command\" is a 1946 movie release made from a condensed 1933 film. Apparently, the earlier film, \"TheThree Musketeers,\" was put together from a series of short ones. Two earlier reviewers give some good information on that. In the early years of movies \u0096 and through the 1950s as I can recall, the standard movie fare on any given weekend was two movies and a cartoon. One film would be a short or a \"B\" grade movie. So, it's interesting to see this much later release of snippets put together in a single film from the 1933 film footage. \n\nOne thing very noticeable, is the difference in quality that 13 years made. By 1946, John Wayne had been in 110 movies. The quality of the films he had been in the past several years \u0096 whether A or B movies, was quite good. So, the snowy, scratchy, poor quality of this Mascot film from 1933 footage really stands out.\n\nThis film has lots of the action from the earlier film. But it suffers greatly in the plot, editing and all technical aspects. I think the plot has several holes where scenes don't connect well. For instance, Elaine Corday (played by Ruth Hall) rides to an Arab hideout to report a possible spy to an Arab chieftain. It sure looked like she was part of the evil network of El Shatan. So, when other scenes have her helping one side and then the other, it becomes quite confusing. \n\nThis film has some well known names of the time in the cast, besides John Wayne. But aside from the action in a very choppy and disoriented plot, there's little else to recommend it.",

But have no fear because Tom Wayne (John Wayne) comes through with a plane and wipes out the bad guys. Soon he and The Three Musketeers form a friendship and have to try and bring down an evil Arab who is doing illegal things.\n\nDESERT COMMAND is a feature length version of the 1933 serial THE THREE MUSKETEERS. If you're familiar with these feature versions then you know that they usually cut out almost two hours worth of footage and it comes across as a confusing mess. I was shocked to see how this one here managed to tell a pretty straight story and if you didn't already know this was a serial you probably wouldn't even realize that it's missing so much footage.\n\nI found this to be pretty entertaining thanks to a pretty good cast and some of them giving really bad performances. This includes Wayne who is all over the place here, which I was shocked to see. I recently watched a lot of his \"B\" Westerns from this period and he wasn't nearly as bad in them as he is here. Some of his line delivery is extremely bad but it's still fun seeing him. Lon Chaney, Jr. (still working under his original name) also gives a pretty bad performance as he was still years away from tuning his craft. Noah Beery, Jr. and silent star Francis X. Bushman Jr. are in the supporting cast. \n\nAs I said, the story itself holds up fairly well in this 72-minute version but the most impressive thing were the various stunts. I thought the stunt work was extremely good and we got some pretty good action scenes scattered throughout the running time. I'd also argue that the ending, which turns into a semi-horror film, was also quite good. DESERT COMMAND certainly isn't a masterpiece but it's mildly entertaining.",

It's easier to play Cowboys & Arabs, DESERT COMMAND reveals, than the more familiar game Cowboys & Indians because once guys don their white robes and start gargling their words in a deep voice, White Men are indistinguishable from North Africans. This is probably pretty effective with the Arab women folk, too, as Mr. Wayne looks downright fetching when he's sporting Osama Bin Laden garb.",

However, like many of the old serials, it was later trimmed significantly to make it feature length. So, from 210 minutes, it now is about 72! Not surprisingly, the film seems choppy and vague--the result getting rid of 2/3 the serial! \n\nThe film begins with three French Legionnaires trapped in the desert with the enemy about to wipe them out once and for all. However, out of no where comes an American plane (flown by John Wayne) to wipe out the baddies and help French colonialism to flourish (is that really such a good thing?!). Now the men are best friends with Wayne and vow to be like the Musketeers of old (hence the original title, \"The Three Musketeers\"). But, the evil leader of the rebels, El Shaitan, and his Devil's Circle, vow to split them up and destroy the French. Will he do it or will the Legion be victorious? What do you think?! \n\nThe biggest thing you'll notice apart from how choppy the film can be is that the acting (including Wayne) is pretty limp at times. The same can be said for a young Lon Chaney Junior (billed under his real name, Creighton Chaney). The writing isn't any better--and I had to laugh at all the times Wayne DIDN'T shoot people or take out baddies once and for all. For the most part, this is a pretty poor film and is probably only of interest to die-hard John Wayne fans and fans of good 'ol colonialism. Otherwise, it's very easy to skip.",

This was a brave concept considering how early in Bugs' career this film was made but his impact was so instant that the Bugs/Elmer dynamic was already well enough established with audiences for this experimental take on it to work. Elmer Fudd takes up hypnotism as a way of overpowering woodland animals. With a view to using it on Bugs, he pursues the rabbit but cannot get him to cooperate long enough to hypnotise him. This sequence sets out the normal occurrences of a Bugs and Elmer picture for anyone who may be unfamiliar with them. However, when Bugs hypnotises Elmer into thinking he's a rabbit, Elmer takes on the characteristics of Bugs and begins heckling right back, forcing Bugs into the Elmer role. It's an unexpected and brilliantly executed twist which makes for a fascinating role-reversal based second half. One of the rare cartoons where Bugs ends up as the fall guy, 'The Hare-Brained Hypnotist' is a refreshing experience as Elmer finally gets some payback. The slightly too bizarre ending does not detract from how brilliantly Freleng has pulled off a potentially very complex film.",

When Elmer sticks his rifle in Bugs' rabbit hole, Bugs grabs the rifle and starts a tug-of-war with Elmer. They both apply this same tug-of-war gag a little later, after Bugs hypnotizes Elmer and switches roles with him. And while Bugs talks to the audience and munches on a carrot, Elmer hides behind him and shoves two more carrots in Bugs' mouth.\n\nThis cartoon was directed by Friz Freleng, who wasn't crazy about Elmer Fudd and probably felt uncomfortable using him. This could be why he allowed Elmer and Bugs to switch roles in the second half of the picture, so that Elmer does not appear to be nearly as idiotic as he usually does. It is not often that we see Bugs as the fall guy, thus proving that nobody, not even Bugs Bunny, wins ALL the time. So when he becomes the victim instead of the prankster, he sure does take it hard! In any event, Friz need not have worried about Elmer for long, because another one of Bugs' adversaries was soon to take root. The name: Yosemite Sam!",

'The Hare-Brained Hypnotist (1942)' was directed by Friz Freleng, and was released October 31, 1942. The cartoon is notable in that the animators have reverted back to the Elmer Fudd we're all accustomed to, after retiring the experimental rotund version that was last featured in 'Fresh Hare (1942).' It is also interesting in that, unlike the majority of Bugs' encounters with Fudd, the humiliation isn't all one-way traffic, and the pair actually find their traditional comedic roles to have been reversed due to the influence of the powerful hypnotism. The film ends with arrogant Bugs as the fall-guy, having been duped into the belief that he is a Douglas XB-19 experimental bomber aircraft (\"I'm the B-19!\"), promptly due at the airport to make his flight.\n\nThe characteristically-dim Fudd opens the cartoon on his usual hunting trip through the forest, though he's also found it necessary to read a new book at the same time. When he happens upon the secret to hypnotism, Fudd tests the technique on a ferocious bear, which is soon fluttering in the stratosphere with the presupposition of being a canary. Here, he decides, is his real opportunity to bamboozle the \"pesky wabbit\" once and for all. But, of course, Bugs proves himself to be more troublesome than his opponent had anticipated, and it isn't long before Fudd finds himself at the receiving end of a hypnotist's powerful glare. This is when director Friz Freleng turns the tables: after Fudd is ordered to act like a rabbit, he immediately hijacks Bugs' usual comedic niche, and the hapless rabbit, despite thinking himself the winner in this particular spate, is consistently out-witted by the stealthy wabbit known as Elmer Fudd. The cleverest Merrie Melodies are those that recognise the series' clich\u00e9s and actively subvert them \u0096 'The Hare-Brained Hypnotist' does this very well.",

While the forces are away \"The Gorgon,\" the young daughter of a Pisan nobleman who has been heroically killed, comes to be solemnly invested as the figurehead virgin who will maintain a lantern to celebrate the men's victorious return. In charge of the home guard is an ambitious young Florentine who feels deprived of the forthcoming honour and glory, and who seeks revenge by violating the sacred person of the virgin. He gains access to her well guarded quarters, but when the Gorgon falls helplessly in love with him, his desire for vengeance falls away.

King of the Rocketmen was always a fantastic hero, with his legendary flying suit. BUT that was before I got to see the Copperhead battle Dr. Satan on television every Sunday morning.  This is one of the most well constructed serials that Republic ever produced.  Cianelli, as Dr. Satan, is a consummate villain, one who has no vague motivations--this guy is evil from the word \"go\". Robert Wilcox as hero Bob Wayne is EXTREMELY capable in the role.  Not only can he act--something very difficult with terse, action dominated serial scripts--but he is a fine athlete.  Some of the acrobatic leaps and takedowns are the best ever put on film.  The plot hangs together nicely, something that is unusual in 4 hour long marathons.  But what really puts the icing on the cake is the terrific variety of cliffhanger chapter endings that Republic has employed in this serial.  They are all superbly done, with plausible escapes that don't insult the viewer's intelligence.  In fact, many of these were used in later serials as stock footage in order to save money (a real strength at Republic).  Crisp, snappy direction by Witney and English puts the cap on a GREAT serial.",

The only other ones that come to mind are those many novels and movies that feature Sax Rohmer's DR. FU MANCHU. (Hey, Schultz, since they're both Doctors, why not open a Practice together? Rememmber where you heard it first, friend reader!) \n\nAS FOR THE story/screenplay/scenario, it has been said to have been a reworking of a script intended by Republic Pictures to be used for SUPERMAN'S Live Action screen debut of the Man of Steel. It seemed that Detective Comics,inc., Superman's copyright owners, for whatever reason balked at the idea of having that studio do the serial.* \n\nTHE 'GOOD' DR, Satan is as powerful and evil as he is mysterious. The casting of Italian-born , Opera Trained Actor Eduardo Cianelli, as the lead and villain extrodinaire is right up there with Universal Pictures bring us Charles B. Middleton as Emperor Ming, the Merciless in the three FLASH GORDON Serials.\n\nIN THE PERSON of the Copperhead, we see a rather talented journeyman actor and sometimes Leading Man in some \"B\" Movies, Robert Wilcox. His portrayal of the very Batman-like masked crime fighter was excellent and quite believable. (His secret identity was even given as BOB WAYNE!) In the story, there had been a Copperhead before (we think it was his Father), as the first chapter is titled: The Return of the Copperhead.\n\nTHE CHOICE OF the very name of Copperhead is curious; as it is both a common name for a poisonous snake native to the United States, as well as a name given to Northern Democrat sympathizers to the Confederate cause in the War Between The States.\n\nTHE SERIAL FEATURED plenty of top-notch action, great stunts and the sort of story that ignored the looming entrance of America into the hostilities of World War II. They even gave us that great mechanical monster of the Post Steam Age, a 'living and breathing' Robot! \n\nALTHOUGH WE DO own a video copy of this one now, we remember first seeing it on the local TV Show on Channel 7, the ABC wholly owned affiliate, WBKB (now WLS). This was circa 1957.We really dug it then and find so much of that innocent, child-like enthusiasm for it now.\n\nAS A MATTER OF fact, both Schultz and myself rate this MYSTERIOUS DR. Satan right up there with the best chapter-plays of that period; those being: HAWK OF THE WILDERNESS, THE ADVENTURES OD CAPTAIN MARVEL, ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION, SPY SMASHER and THE MASKED MARVEL.\n\nNOTE: * Perhaps the publishers of SUPERMAN and ACTION COMICS had second thoughts about granting license to Republic because of their track record in revisionism displayed in their adaptations. As examples, see the four DICK TRACY Serials, SPY SMASHER (giving him a twin brother) and especially CAPTAIN America; which was surgically changed, leaving only the name in the title.",

I far prefer the pictures he made with Charles Hawtrey to the 'classic' teaming with Moore/Marriott, and an excellent supporting cast here includes Peter Ustinov and Frank Pettingell (of \"Gaslight\" fame).\n\nI always find Hay funnier when he is being a pompous but resourceful twit rather than simply an arrogant incompetent, and here his schoolmaster character is put up against the Nazis and manages (with assistance) to rise to the occasion... aided by the fact that his opponents half the time are even bigger buffoons than he is. A sharp script relies heavily on verbal humour, with two outstanding scenes that riff on the absurdities of the English language. The invasion plan sequence in which Hay improvises strategy wildly in a cascade of puns while attempting to pick a German general's pocket deserves to be a classic of the genre (take them from the flanks in Lancs to keep the Paras all tied up in Notts... but don't get caught with your Panzers down in the Severn Tunnel).\n\nThere is also a clever yet natural-seeming series of gags making use of an asbestos suit, some of which you can see (and enjoy) coming in advance, some of which I didn't! The final reels of the film didn't work quite so well for me, chiefly because I couldn't help but be aware that with all those antics the plane wouldn't have lasted for a minute and had some trouble suspending my disbelief in the name of comedy -- it's always funnier when it's actually physically plausible, however far-fetched. (The ingenious tactic by which Hay contrives to prevent his friend Professor Hoffmann from drinking a glass of poison by triggering his \"Heil Hitler\" reflex precisely at the requisite moment, for example.) Up to that point I would have rated the film at a definite 8/10; I still rate it a solid seven.\n\nThe contrast between English and American propaganda films was never more marked; see also \"Night Train to Munich\", \"Pimpernel Smith\" and even \"The Lady Vanishes\" for Englishmen working against the Nazis who simply don't take themselves all that seriously.",

It's just that local ranchers are spooked based on a belief that the Hidden Valley Ranch might be responsible for people going missing from time to time. Instead, the ranch is being used as a staging area for rustled cattle, with rival bandits Dawson (Charles King) and Arnold (Zon Murray) competing for top spot in the outlaw enterprise, and only too willing to keep the haunted hoax working in their favor.\n\nA young English immigrant, Henry Trenton (John Meredith) enters the picture having inherited the ranch from a former acquaintance of Billy Carson (Buster Crabbe). This was a little curious to me, as the ranch's former owner was Trenton's father, and I had to wonder how an Englishman came to acquire it in the first place. Trenton arrives in an English tailor's version of Western cowboy attire and sets the local tongues wagging, along with a butler who seems to get in the way more often than not.\n\nThere's a puzzler of a scene in the latter part of the story when Dawson and Arnold chase Henry on horseback out to Hidden Valley, where Billy and Fuzzy are waiting for him to show up. The baddies are shooting away at Trenton, yet when they get to the ranch, there are already four more of Dawson's henchmen crouched behind scrub cover firing upon the Trenton house. How did they manage to get there without instructions from the boss? \n\nWell, at least one of the bad guys got his due here. When Arnold finally had enough of putting up with Dawson, he plugs him to take over the gang! Turns out he was an outlaw by the name of Jim Slade who was run out of Cheyenne for cattle rustling there too. He was branded with an 'R' on his back, making it easy for Carson to identify him.\n\nSo the story comes and goes without any spooky sightings or ghostly apparitions, which Fuzzy managed to rectify the following year in 1947's \"Ghost Town Renegades\", teaming up with another screen cowboy, Lash LaRue. In that one, Fuzzy pulls out all the stops doing some acrobatic stunt work while trying to make a grab of a 'haunted' hat at an abandoned mining cabin.",

Lillian Hellman's script boots them all across Europe, from Mussolini's takeover of Rome to the bombing of Madrid to the signing of the Munich Accord . Meanwhile, Young's wife [Ann Richards] entertains assorted brownshirts and blackshirts because she's a shallow socialite, while their war-wounded son [Douglas Dick, in Montgomery Clift's star-making Broadway role] stays home to sort out his own objections to the family's appeasement policies.\n\nFor mainstream Hollywood, this idea-driven story was an honorable attempt to dramatize issues of conscience and responsibility [though criticism of official silence about budding fascist regimes was surely a bit late by 1946]. However, everyone gets to face a moral crisis here, from crusty Grandpa [Dudley Digges] down to a waiter who pauses to deliver a lecture on Woodrow Wilson, and marrying its serious ideas with an uncompelling love triangle seems contrived.\n\nHellman writes literate but non-stop dialogue, making everyone mouth the same high-minded generalities [\"Whenever people talk about not taking sides, they've already taken one,\" or \"People who know what they want don't wait to get it.\"] After an hour of politely listening to such unlikely repartee, we gradually grow weary, then dismayed, and finally exasperated. Was Hellman paid by the word, like Dickens?\n\nThis torrent of talk leaves no room for the film to breathe, so all of William Dieterle's fluent staging produces only claustrophobia. Also, while Lee Garmes' exquisite lighting and Hans Dreier's cavernous interiors mark a\nhigh point in Hollywood gloss, the decor is so fancy that we in the audience can only goggle in awe at the dilemmas of these privileged power-brokers, surely not what Hellman intended. Still, as James Agee noted, \"People as highly civilized as these are seldom seen in the movies, and are still more seldom played with understanding.\" True, but one is tempted to throw buckets of ice water on the cast to stop their debating.\n",

Not a huge success, but acclaimed nonetheless. Frankly, the writing's better for the screenplay.\n\nThere's a lot, too, to be said for the sort of noir-flavored, female-centered drama that Hal Wallis and (frequently) William Dieterle produced in this era. \"Love Letters,\" for instance, \"The Accused\" ... That plus the Hellman style make an intriguing (as well as intrigue-filled) combination.",

                "text": "Lillian Hellman was a committed political animal. Many in her day and since have attacked her for being too committed, and for being too left of center - and she was. However the majority of her most vituperous critics were also committed political animals, but too far to the right. Whether or not this includes Mary McCarthy and her famous comment that nothing Hellman said was true (including prepositions) I cannot say. But Hellman and her lover Dashiell Hamnett were blacklisted by people following the likes of the Joseph McCarthys and Roy Cohens and Edgar Hoovers of our society. While I don't agree with a full-speed ahead left of center philosophy, I think this world has seen enough of a full-speed ahead right of center philosophy. In comparison to Hellman and Hamnett, how much damage did McCarthy, Cohen, and Hoover accomplish (i.e., how many lives did they destroy).\n\nHellman had looked at American isolationism in WATCH ON THE RHINE (1943) in the Washington, D.C. household of Lucille Watson (widow of a Supreme Court Justice). The then European war is brought straight into her safe household due to her two son-in-laws, Paul Lukas (anti-Nazi) and George Coulouris (collaborationist). Watson, in the end, awakes to the threat from the right in Europe that can reach us here. But the cost is that Lukas has to return to the charnal house in Europe to carry on the struggle (until we get involved ourselves).\n\nHere, in THE SEARCHING WIND, Hellman looks at the various events from the end of World War I to Munich. Her \"hero\" is Robert Young, in possibly his most uncertain, fitful performance (not to knock his performance - he is trying to be a diplomat who is uncertain about what to do, so he is performing the part properly). Young, married to Ann Richards, is intelligent and questioning, but easily swayed to being placid. After all, what does he care about the situations in countries like Italy, Spain, or Czechoslovakia. None of this should appear to effect the U.S. We are across the Atlantic after all. His wife, who likes to swan with the elite of these countries (frequently right wing types) helps keep her wavering husband from stirring up bad feelings. Only that reporter (Sylvia Sidney) would try to stir up Young's more troubled feelings - but he is mentally and spiritually too weak to really confront the danger. \n\nInterestingly enough Young's diplomatic career resembles a more notorious (now notorious) figure from our diplomatic corps of the period. This was Breckenridge Long, a descendant of a distinguished Kentucky political family, and a total anti-Semite. Long began as a diplomat in Italy, and was a total supporter of Mussolini's fascists. Subsequently he apparently fully supported Hitler's rise to power in Germany and Central Europe. He made certain that there was little help from the State Department for Jews to get into this country (outside from unfair quotas) in the 1930s. Young is not as vicious as Long was (he is simply ineffective and timid), but one wonders if Hellman based his character in part on Long.\n\nMy only point against the film is the business regarding Young and Richard's son, and the secret he tells them to devastate them at the end. His physical problems might still have occurred even if Young had acted in a more determined manner in warning the U.S. government about the rising threat of the right in Europe - after all, final government policy was still determined in Congress, and it was heavily isolationist until Pearl Harbor (then it became politically suicidal to be isolationist). This would suggest that we would still have gone to war, even if Young had spoken out. So Young's son might still have the physical problem no matter what. But Hellman was still commenting on the willing blindness of our diplomats, so this is a minor quibble at best - the film is still on target.",

                "text": "In all honesty, I struggled during the first half hour of THE SEARCHING WIND and almost gave up on it-- but my opinion had considerably changed by the end. Let's get to the problems with the first thirty minutes, and then go into how great it becomes after that.\n\nIt's a Hal Wallis production, and for those who know his films-- they tend to be meticulously crafted affairs (which usually works in the viewer's favor but sometimes does not). This picture had an incredible budget, and as a result, it features extravagant sets and backdrops. Wallis and his director, William Dieterle, are in no hurry to start the story. They want us to soak up the atmosphere and tease us about the tale to follow. While everything is lavishly staged and intriguing up front, it's like going to a concert to see a great orchestra perform and you get an elongated overture while the curtain still remains drawn. You want them to pull the curtain back so everything can get underway. That's how THE SEARCHING WIND feels in the beginning. There are numerous scenes and characters referring to the past-- and you just know a large flashback is going to follow, which it eventually does, but it is repeatedly delayed.\n\nI believe there's a reason the main action is delayed. It is so the prologue can establish Wallis' new discovery, Douglas Dick-- he plays the young crippled son in the modern-day scenes. But in other films of this type without a movie debut, the opening sequence would be considerably pared down. Because of its lengthy warm-up, the film's overall running time pushes nearly two hours and it could easily have been told in a much more succinct 90 minutes.\n\nOnce the preamble is out of the way, and the flashbacks occur-- we do get a very interesting story about wartime intrigue involving an American diplomat (played by Robert Young). Because of his own isolationist point of view, he turns a blind eye to the encroaching fascism in Italy and other parts of Europe. Since he represents American views, the U.S. is regarded as silently supporting fascist politics due to Young's unwillingness to take a stand against it.\n\nTHE SEARCHING WIND is based on Lillian Hellman's award-winning stage play of the same name, and she wrote the screenplay. All the way through this is Hellman's indictment on the self-serving, ignorant bourgeoisie. She brings these points home continuously throughout the narrative, and it all comes to a thought-provoking climax in the last act.\n\nBut do not assume this is only about war and government politics. Hellman's story is also a woman's melodrama, where if Sylvia Sidney and Wallis' other discovery Ann Richards were not in the main female roles, we might easily see this production cast with the likes of Bette Davis and Mary Astor. Sidney, who does an extraordinary job in this motion picture, plays Young's long-lost love; and Richards is the self-serving wife whose main interest abroad is rubbing elbows with royalty and other important heads of state to promote her husband's career. The romantic triangle between these three older adults frequently takes center stage while various atrocities and betrayals occur in the background.\n\nEventually Sidney comes to reject Young, because as a journalist, her investigations have led her to realize her lover's complicity in the on-going horrors of war in Europe. And not only does she give Young the brush-off at the end, sending him back into the arms of a self- indulgent wife who is much like himself, he also learns a horrible truth about his son's injuries in battle. So Hellman neatly brings it all full-circle, and the pay-off is dramatically satisfying. But of course, Wallis and Dieterle have paced it so leisurely at times, especially in the early portions, that a tighter more economic brand of storytelling is out of the question. \n\nSometimes a longer running time forces us to absorb the characters and their situations more. And that is probably what happened to me as I resigned myself to the fact that I was going to watch the whole thing through to the end. It became less laborious and more enjoyable. Granted, I didn't care for some of Young's acting-- he was a little too one-note in some sections where he is supposed to be a thoughtless upper class heel. But that's probably how Hellman wrote it and Dieterle wanted it played-- he is supposed to be quite boorish in spots, so we can see how poorly represented American interests were in Italy, Spain and Germany during the second World War. At least his slightly bland characterization is more than balanced out by the superb work of Sidney and Richardson.\n\nMeanwhile, Dudley Digges appears as Richardson's snobbish father (it was Digges' last screen role), and his moments on camera are usually quite entertaining. As for Wallis' young new actor, Douglas Dick, he looks like he could be Young's son and Digges' grandson; and he does well with the big speech at the end, railing against his family. \n\nWhen THE SEARCHING WIND concluded, I realized that the film blew me nearly in a new direction. Not all films, I understand, give the viewer immediate gratification. Some stories that play out on screen make us work. But if our thoughts have gone in a slightly different, more profound direction-- like Hellman's thesis mostly encourages us-- then I'd say it's all been worth it.",

                "text": "\nThere are several reasons to relish this curio. It was a prentice work by Thorold Dickinson, the Hitchcock assistant and cutter who would shoot \"Gaslight\" and \"The Queen of Spades\" before becoming Britain's first professor of film. It is one of the earliest sports movies to feature real sportsmen- acting very woodenly, as befits stiff-upper-lip soccer stars. It is anchored by a mischievously eccentric performance by Leslie Banks, who a few years later was to be the magnificent Chorus of Olivier's \"Henry V\".\n\nAbove all, the film lets us glimpse pre-war Britain's, maybe the world's, leading football club. Arsenal FC, the \"Gunners\", had been raised to pre-eminence by Herbert Chapman, Britain's first modern soccer manager, until his untimely death in 1934. Five years later his team were still on top, coached by his deputy George Allison, who appears in the movie.\n\nHighbury Stadium, the setting for the murder, was state of the art. The scene in the treatment room underlines Chapman's far-sighted, scientific approach to caring for his players. He was an early advocate of floodlights and numbered shirts, and even got the name of the local Tube station altered to advertise the Gunners. The film was a massive plug for them; alas, soon after its release the Second World War meant that the lads had to pick up real guns and compete in a more dangerous game. Afterwards Arsenal did not recover its top-of-the-tree status for 25 years. Unwittingly this production memorialises its greatest era.",

The world depicted was on another planet - even though Britain was at war the lunatics would not start to take over the asylum for another 30 years or so.\n\nProfessional Arsenal take on the amateur Trojans in special football match attended by millions of blue-chins in macs and hats live on BBC radio, and even commentated by legendary voice E.V.H. Emmett borrowed from Gaumont. One of the Trojans, a bit of a womaniser with a lot of enemies falls down dead at the beginning of the second half and the game is abandoned and is simultaneously on to find out whodunit. Slade of Scotland Yard is on the case, an inspector with eccentric and disconcerting habits played fantastically by Leslie Banks in a variety of appropriate hats. Although thousands of the Arsenal fans who saw todays game at the Emirates probably live in houses built before 1940 the \"beautiful game\" seems to have changed almost beyond recognition - capitalist business pressures seem to have atrophied everything that was once decent about it. The footballers played and the hordes watched as though it was only a game and didn't matter - the rich thugs who go to work on the pitch today present a completely different picture! Anyone fancy going back and practising heading those leather footballs? Surely they would miss the legalised GBH and sliding about in each others phlegm and spit! The mystery itself was simple but well padded out and entertaining, and the acting abilities veered from adequately professional to woodenly amateur.\n\nI never bothered taping or buying this because it's on UK Channel 4 every few years \u0096 I assume it's always been bought so regularly mainly as a laugh for hooligans by the schedulers and not just for film fans. Use the chance when they provide it to watch this enjoyable and decent film non-cynically instead.",

                "text": "\nAmateur team the Trojans are setting the world of English football alight by beating many of the top Division 1 teams in the country.  However a friendly match against champions Arsenal will be a true test of their skill.  The games starts well with Arsenal leading 1-0 (what else!) at half time.  Minutes into the second half one of the Trojans collapses and is found to be dead.  The police are called in and find that the player had not died of natural causes but was murdered, the investigation begins, led by Inspector Slade, who wants the whole thing done and dusted before his theatre performance with the police in 3 days time.\n\nAnother reviewer here has claimed that this film is `oft forgotten' however I must really disagree with them \u0096 this is a famous film that the vast majority of Arsenal fans will be aware of if not seen, outside of them many football fans will be aware of it.  I know of it from listening to Danny Baker on the radio years ago talk about it, since then I have seen it twice as it is occasionally on TV here in the UK.  It is a fantastic film in terms of curio value although it does stand up by itself in some ways.\n\nAs a mystery the film is OK and it has a pretty standard plot for this type of film, I have to be honest and say that the story didn't really grab me and the characters were too thinly developed to really care much about the victim or indeed, the killer.  Strangely the film doesn't use Highbury as well as it should have done.  The opening 10 minutes features a lot of play but aside from that it fades into the background a bit \u0096 personally I'd have liked a lot more of the action to have occurred in the stadium proper, more pitch side scenes would have been good (even in the empty stadium).\n\nThe football action is a mix of silly stuff and authentic style play.  The silly stuff involves several staged runs where defenders are easily skipped by with little skill involved!  However the game flows quite well and shows how much quicker the game today is, I found this very interesting because it has historical value to see football back then (even if it isn't a real game).  The footballers in their real roles is interesting but I couldn't tell you their names so really it could have been anyone \u0096 the most obvious clue is that many of them cannot act for toffee and struggle to say a few lines convincingly (how things change eh?) but it did add to the film's charm.  One of the most amusing thing about the film that I really hope is true is the gentle manner in which the crowd bullies the referee with friendly banter.  At one point the referee comes over, talks to one of the crowd, gets a cheeky reply and gives a `get on' gesture!  I wish it were really like that \u0096 it would certainly be much better than `who's the b*stard in the black' chanted over and over.\n\nThe film itself is saved from it's weaknesses by being actually quite funny and tongue in cheek throughout.  This is all down to a great performance from Banks as Inspector Slade.  He is very eccentric and just a little camp.  He worries over the hat he wears, flaps around making many weird statements and is as concerned by his show as he is by the murder.  His tongue in cheek delivery is perfect and it makes the film that much more enjoyable.  It's hard to describe but he really is very good.  His sidekick is good value as well playing the straight man well.  The majority of the players (both Arsenal and Brentford Town) are OK but of more value in terms of history than performance \u0096 my favourite was the Arsenal chairman who acted well in his scenes.\n\nOverall this isn't a great film and the mystery side of it could have been better, but the use of Highbury and the mock friendly played will make it of passing interest to the majority of football fans.  However it is the enjoyable tongue-in-cheek humour (mainly from Bank's role) that makes this a much better film than it would have been if played straight!",

                "text": "Thorold Dickinson, who directed the much superior 1940 version of \"Gaslight\", also directed this mystery, which was one of the first films where football played a very central part to the plot. It was Arsenal's last official league fixture before World War 11 and several of their players and staff were featured in the film. The Trojan players on the pitch were from Brentford football club.\n\nThe film begins with a promotional newsreel that introduces players from both Arsenal and the Trojans - both teams are watching but Trojan's star player is missing. John Doyce (Anthony Bushell) is a \"swell head\", who is romancing Gwen Lee (Greta Gynt - Britain's closest answer to a sex symbol in the 1940s) - but she is engaged to another player, Phillip.\n\nAs the game on Saturday progresses it is clear that Doyce wants to be the whole show and is not a team player - he is not popular among the other players. At half time he receives a diamond ring in a box - before the end of the match he is dead.\n\nEnter the eccentric detective, Inspector Slade (Leslie Banks), who has been called away from organizing the annual policeman's panto to solve the murder of the philandering footballer. Meanwhile Gwen has gone to Doyce's flat collecting photos, letters and anything that may incriminate her. The police are anxious to find her and their search is made easy as she is a top model and her face is in every newspaper and magazine. They are hampered by Gwen's mysterious flatmate Inga (Liane Linden,a Swedish actress, who surprisingly made only a handful of films) who tries to throw them off the scent. Has she something to hide????\n\nEveryone has a grudge against Doyce - he was also blackmailing some of his teammates. When Gwen is found dead, with a bottle of digitalis in her hand, Slade instantly suspects murder!!! With an ambiguous newspaper clipping about a body floating in the river Fosse, Slade feels that she was killed because she knew who murdered Doyce.\n\nI thought it was an excellent mystery laced with comedy. I did not guess \"who done it\" but the person was found out in a very unusual way.\n\nDid anyone notice the strange news poster that proclaimed \"We Warn Hitler's British Friends\"!!!\n\nLeslie Banks is my favourite British actor. Even though his first film was the classic American horror film \"The Most Dangerous Game\", he also appeared to advantage in a couple of Alfred Hitchcock films - \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1934) and \"Jamaica Inn\" (1939).\n\nHighly Recommended.",

Not so much a dressing room as a Masonic Lodge.",

The second cartoon in this \"filmography\" featured this same pinkish-white bunny with a big black nose in a haunted house with 2 dogs.\n\nAs the weekend marathon, known as \"June Bugs\" progressed from this 1938 cartoon to the very latest of Bugs' works, we saw the little pinkish white rabbit who was kind of daffy and hyper metamorphose into the wise cracking, brazen hare of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett fame, and then into an older, kinder, more mature Bugs that Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Robert McKimson preferred.

The hooligan hare utters Groucho Marx's \"Of course you realize this means war!\" for the first time. It would still be two years before audiences would hear \"What's up, doc?\" spoken by the rabbit's more familiar form, but there's a sense that this bunny has some really cool tricks up his sleeve.

                "text": "On the Cartoon Brew site, Jerry Beck linked from YouTube a video by one Martha Sigall called The Story of Bugs Bunny. Who is this woman who's now in her 90's? She was in the Ink and Paint department at \"Termite Terrace\" during the various formations of what would become \"that wascally wabbit\". It's quite a fascinating tale with Ms. Sigall using a framed demonstration of the various character poses and different drawings of the wabbit to the one we know of him today. That YouTube segment led me to watch the original cartoon that featured what was the first version of what became Bugs Bunny (named after the director who made this cartoon, Ben \"Bugs\" Hardaway) on the same site. It's sort of the same short as Porky's Duck Hunt made by Tex Avery except Porky's hunting rabbits. \"Bugs\" here is actually all white and has the voice and laugh of Woody Woodpecker which is not surprising since this rabbit's voice originator, Mel Blanc, would create that same voice and laugh for that character at Walter Lantz a couple of years later. Anyway, there were some creative gags I liked such as when a toy decoy rabbit kicks Porky's dog Zero in the face or when the rabbit uses his ears as propellers in escaping from Porky and his dog. And how about the first time he quotes Groucho Marx's line from Duck Soup, \"Of course you know, this means war!\" Quite enjoyable this early short but since Daffy Duck was already the resident \"crazy\", it was decided to make Bugs more of the wiseguy type by the time Avery recreated him in the form we know him as today in A Wild Hare. Good move, Tex! So on that note, I recommend Porky's Hare Hunt. P.S. Ms. Sigall has a book about her experience at Leon Schlesinger Productions/Warner Bros. Cartoons called \"Living Life Inside the Lines\" out now.",

However, I like to think that this is Bugs Bunny and in ways I prefer him to the later Bugs. I just slightly prefer what he looks like in this to his nowadays state (and his size). Bugs Bunny's original name was Happy Rabbit, which I think suits him here.\n\nI like this episode because of the personality of the old Bugs Bunny, the gags (which are a little like Disney gags) and Zero (Porky's dog) is sweet. It may have little plot, but this is hardly a flaw. Indeed, it could have been better with a plot, but it was not necessary.\n\nWhat happens, is that (like in Porky's Duck Hunt) Porky is hunting, but this time for rabbits. With his dog Zero Porky Pig tries to catch the wild and Houdini-like Bugs Bunny, but is not seeming to be managing...\n\nRecommended for people who enjoy old Looney Tunes and who would like to see the most charming Bugs Bunny ever! Enjoy \"Porky's Hare Hunt\"! :-)",

                "summary": "Mob Comedy Is An Offer You Shouldn't Refuse",
                "text": "As a fan of comedies from Hollywood's Golden Age, I've seen such classics as \"Duck Soup,\", \"His Girl Friday,\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\" many, many times. Though I never tire of them, I often wonder if there are many unheralded gems still deep in Hollywood's vaults awaiting the light of day. For this reason alone, the invaluable cable television station Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is always worth visiting for a little prospecting. \n\nToday, I found a fair-sized gold nugget there: \"The Lady and the Mob\" (Columbia Pictures, 1939). Ever hear of it? I hadn't, and chances are, you haven't either. Ever since TCM gained access to Columbia's vaults, some interesting films started reaching the public again, like \"Ladies in Retirement\" (1941), a twisty suspense film with a superb performance from Ida Lupino. I mention Miss Lupino because she's second-billed in \"The Lady & The Mob.\" Comedy was never a big part of her career, but she acquits herself quite well in the supporting role of Lila Thorne, fianc\u00e9e of Fred Leonard (Lee Bowman) who sends her to meet and be approved by his mother, Hattie Leonard (Fay Bainter) who has a track record for scaring away prospective brides. \n\nWhat seems to be the set-up for a '30s Hollywood comedy of manners quickly shifts gears into another comedic sub-genre, the mob comedy, best typified by such films as \"Brother Orchid\" (1940) and \"A Slight Case of Murder\" (1938), two Warner Bros. light-hearted offerings that gave Edward G. Robinson a chance to spoof his tough guy image.\n\nAfter visiting her local cleaners to complain about a $2 bill, Hattie learns that the owner, Mr. Zambrogio (Henry Armetta) had to raise prices because a \"protective association\" is extorting $7 a week from him and others. Outraged after the mayor assures her that the matter will be remedied eventually sometime, she sends for Frankie O'Fallon (Warren Hymer), a reformed thief whom she met when he tried to steal her purse, to lend a hand. Framkie is quickly decked by Harry the Lug (Harold Huber), the racket collector prompting Hattie to order Frankie to recruit her own mob. Before long, we are introduced to Blinky Mack, Brains Logan, Bert the Beetle, Big Time Tim and The Canary (with a voice that sounds like Curly's from The Three Stooges, though it's not) and the laughs which were decent from the beginning start coming at you with the rapidity of a tommy gun.\n\nThe film abounds in bright lines sch as when Hattie, correcting Frankie after he calls her \"lady\", rebukes him with: \"My servants call me madam.\" Perplexed, Frankie comments, \"Gee, that don't hardly sound respectable.\" I love the scene where the local hoods that Hattie has recruited stroll about her mansion looking at her artwork. Seeing a Gainsborough-like painting depicting a child on its mother's lap, one of them urges the others to \"get a load of the ventriloquist here!\" And wait 'til you see their armor-plated getaway car replete with smokescreen generator and dropping tacks, anticipating James Bond's Aston Martin car by a quarter of a century. \n\nIn the lead role, Fay Bainter may appear an odd choice, here looking a lot like May Robson and sounding very much like Billie Burke, two actresses who may have seemed like more natural casting for such a dizzy society matron role. After all, Miss Bainter had established a reputation as a dramatic actress, having been nominated as Best Actress for \"White Banners\" and Best Supporting Actress for \"Jezebel,\" (and winning for the latter role), both for Warner Bros. in 1938, the year before. To work for Columbia (then trying to fight off its \"poverty row studio\" image) in what was at 66 minutes, a B-movie, seemed to be a comedown. Whatever the circumstances -- I'd like to think it was simply someone recognizing a good role in a good script --she makes the film a ton of fun.\n\nAbout midway in, an interesting scene occurs that warrants special mention. After a horde of owners have come to her house, insisting she call off her campaign because the ensuing brawls between the two mobs are wrecking their cleaning stores, Hattie launches into a dramatic monologue about patriotism, quoting Robert G. Harper's \"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.\" In quick succession, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Patrick Henry's most famous lines are also heard. Declaring that a real American will never tolerate a dictator, she likens Mr. Watson, the mid-level operator of the town's protection racket, to one who \"doesn't believe in your rights.\" Don't let him take your America from you, she urges. \n\nWarner Bros. is often credited (and rightly so) with alerting the country to the dangers of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany with its exciting, \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy\" in 1939. That film was released May 6. \"The Lady & The Mob\", first in theaters nearly five weeks earlier on April 3, stole a bit of its thunder. Granted it was only one scene and its impact can hardly be compared to this other film. But I mention it to illustrate that Warner Bros. wasn't the only studio concerned about the Nazis that was willing to make a public statement at the risk of foreign revenues, even if Hitler was never directly named. Although you might think that Hattie's plea might stop the comedy cold, the words are so well-integrated into the plot that they don't kill the mood which is quickly flowing again. \n\nIf you're a fan of gangster comedies, this film is well-worth your time thanks to a good script, several wonderful character actors at their peak, and a high-flying lead performance that will bring a smile to your face long after the movie's over.

                "text": "\"There's never been a run on this bank !\" -- Hattie Leonard.\n\nThat's one of the tasty little nuggets of comedy which gets tossed about, seemingly in a most haphazard manner, in this excellent and user-friendly \"gangster comedy,\" from 1939. In a very real sense, the writers and the director of this film were seeking to do something that is always difficult and sometimes impossible ... which is ... to make a social satire that has more laughs than bites.\n\nConsider that \"The Lady and the Mob\" is a window on a time before our times, before the cruelties and barbarities of World War Two, the Cold War, the Korean War, the Viet Nam War and the never-ending Gulf War, burned away all pretense of innocence from what was once called \"the American Dream.\" Consider that Faye Bainter's character, Hattie -- and she is delightful in the goofiest possible ways -- lampoons the stuffy, hypocritical matrons so often created in the posh comedies of the 1930s.\n\nTo call this a feminist film would be entirely wrong, and yet the strength of the satire, and the plot, lies entirely in the hands of Faye Bainter and Ida Lupino. Indeed, Ms. Ida Lupino gets a plum in this second billing, a role as juicy and sweet as her character is tart with her tongue ! Wealthy Hattie Leonard owns a bank and has a conscience, something most average people who lived during the 1930s and those Depression years probably could not believe -- unless they saw it in a motion picture ! \n\nOne only has to see \"Stagecoach\" with John Wayne, Claire Trevor and John Ford directing, to understand how deeply-felt the animosity of \"regular folks\" was, towards bankers. Both of these films were released in the early part of 1939 and they both tell a tale of truthfulness about how badly damaged people can become decent again, and what it means to be \"a True American\".\n\nSince there is every prospect that Turner Classic Movies will run this fine, funny, film again soon, it would be spoiling things to give away much of the satirical plot of this comedy. Faye Bainter's classic looks and poise are a salute to all that's ever been the best about the actresses of the United States, and Ida Lupino plays her role cleverly. It is a definite mark of natural ability, as Ms. Lupino -- who is quite gorgeous at twenty-five -- darts in and out of the scenes with Bainter and \"her Mob\". The character actors selected to play Hattie's \"stumble bums\" are simply hilarious -- unless the viewer happens to know absolutely nothing about the 1930s and American slang.\n\nEven then, their comedic posturing works really well and is simply visually entertaining. This is a great little gem of a movie and while it does not quite carry the social and satirical \"punch\" of Frank Capra's \"Lady for a Day,\" from 1933, it is well worth viewing, and for capturing on the digital video recorder to have on a lazy, rainy afternoon. Eight stars for comedy, satire, and snappy jokes.",

She gets a moving monologue that with what was going on over in Europe was certainly timely. Rackateer bullies are as dangerous as Hitler, Mussolini and other dictators, she insinuates without mentioning any names, and it us better to die fighting for your liberty than be living in fear under the thumb of brutality.\n\nNot quite a major star yet, Ida Lupino is featured as Bainter's future daughter in law.

                "summary": "More long mystery than typical serial. If you can forgive three later chapters this is a great B mystery that happens to run almost five hours",
                "text": "(Spoilers ahead) Not so much a serial as a long mystery broken up into fifteen parts. This is one long story that simply goes from the opening credits and doesn't really stop. I can't imagine watching this on a weekly basis since the story is so compact that waiting a week for the next part would probably cause you to forget things. Worse if you missed a chapter there might be a chance that you could end up lost.\n\nThe plot of the film, I can't say serial, starts when nightclub owner Joe is leaned on by rival Nick to repay the loan he got to open his club since Nick wants to close up shop and move on. Joe is unable to come up with the amount of money needed so Nick suggests giving him the \"Blue Diamond\" a supposedly cursed necklace. Joe refuses and instead puts it in the paper that his singer will be wearing the necklace the next night. This sets in motion a series of plots and counter plots that leads to the theft of the diamond. The police are called in and Lt Chick Carter is put on the case. \n\nIt's a complicated tale with enough plot for nine one hour long mysteries. What impressed me was that even though the story will loop around on itself by going to the same locations and having a who has the necklace chases what happens is internally consistent, in other words they are not looping back on itself just to fill time (for the most part), we move through time and space because of what the characters do. We also don't get endless recaps, the story kind of assumes that you've been watching and paying attention so events just play out. Even when we get to a cliffhanger events flow outward from them, we don't get, as we do with many Republic serials a discussion of the danger and then a false pause and redirection of the story as if it was all directed at getting to the action sequence, and now that that is over we have to head for the next one.\n\nThe cliffhangers in the serial are not the most spectacular by serial standards. Yes there are a couple of really good ones but mostly they seem to have been placed in the middle of an action sequence. I don't mean this as knock, rather I mention it to point out that the action is part of the story and not the reason for the story. To be honest the \"cliffhangers are really more chapter endings rather than climaxes. For example one of the chapter endings ends when a crow bar is swung at Chick Carter who ducks out of the way, and then the crow bar hits an electrical board producing a shower of sparks. We know Carter is safe, we saw him move out of the way, but it's the closest thing to a \"cliffhanger\" at that moment so it was chosen as the place to end it. There are a couple of bumps like that where ends are almost non-cliffhangers since we know how its going to come out. Its not bad, but it just makes it clear that the cliffhangers are the least important element to the story. \n\nI do have to say that this is a long complex haul. There's a great deal going and its best if you pay some sort of attention (so much is going on you'll probably wonder where Chick Carter is during most of the first chapter since he doesn't show up until the chapter is almost over). And while I was completely enjoying it I was beginning to get tired by the third episode simply because so much was going on. From that point on I was in a battle between wanting to know what was going to happen and being really tired and wanting to go to bed.\n\nThe film does have two problems in my eyes, one minor and one major.\n\nThe minor flaw is that the serial has one character, Ellen Dale who shows up a couple of chapters in and ends up as one of the more important characters. Very little about her is explained and she wanders through the proceeding operating completely according to her own set of rules. Clever viewers will be able to figure out what she's doing, and its explained in the end but before that you really don't know what to make of her.\n\nThe major flaw is that beginning with the moments preceding the end of chapter 11 through until chapter 15 the serial starts to do everything that it hadn't been doing up to this point, namely circling back on itself for no good reason and stalling for time. Logic and reason goes out the window as well as everyone suddenly knows the name of Vasky, the hired gun sought by the police as an unknown killer. Granted Spud hears his name, but no one reacts when he uses it and everyone from that point on knows who he is, even when they shouldn't. To be honest Chapters 12, 13 and 14 take what is a great serial and make it something very good. Clearly Columbia's insistence on a 15 chapter structure works against the film, 12 or 13 would have been better. It does recover in the final chapter but its really annoying since other than those three chapters this is a dynamite crime drama.\n\nI really liked it and would rather think of it as one long mystery then 15 parts. Worth a look for those who want a long mystery for an evening, or for those searching for an atypical serial.",

I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A brooding Colman isn't a favorite of mine.\n\nBut in A Double Life precisely because his part as actor Anthony John is so offbeat for him, Colman was recognized with a Best Actor Oscar for 1947. It became his best known part.\n\nColman is an actor who really does take the Method quite seriously. He's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he's quite the jovial fellow. For a change of pace now that that play has concluded its Broadway run, Colman is bringing a revival of Othello to New York. About as opposite a part as you can get.\n\nHis leading lady in both is his former wife Signe Hasso who loves him dearly, but can't take his change of moods when he's at work. Colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back. But he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with her role as Desdemona.\n\nUnfortunately Shelley Winters as a poor waitress who a depressed Colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor Desdemona in the play. Killed in the same manner and now it's a matter for homicide cop Joe Sawyer.\n\nColman's performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors? I'd shudder to think so, were there any unsolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles then they essayed Othello. \n\nI could never quite buy the story for that reason, but I certainly do applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the Oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others in the running that year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra.\n\nColman gets able support from the rest of the cast including Edmond O'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. Still you will find no Iago equivalent in A Double Life, no one prodding the jealousy, it's all in his own mind.\n\nAnd that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century.",

A brilliant performance and he's surrounded by excellent supporting players, notably Shelley Winters in one of her earliest roles as a dumb waitress. Signe Hasso and Edmond O'Brien are fine too. Her fear of Colman's manic state looks genuine as he looms over her figure on the bed, preparing to strangle her. \n\nNot the sort of film you'd expect George Cukor to direct but he does it well with only occasional slow stretches in a story that could have been more tightly controlled with too much repetition in the stage scenes.

                "summary": "The Tragedy of Anthony John, Actor of New York City",
                "text": "A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe) as best actor. Let's take the second point first.\n\nIs Anthony John Colman's greatest role, or even his signature role? I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles. Most of his career, Ronald Colman played decent gentlemen, frequently in dangerous or atypical situations. He is Bulldog Drummond (cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist) fighting crime. He is Raffles, the great cricket player and even greater burglar, trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor. He is Robert Conway, the great imperial political figure, who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth, Shangri-La. He is Dick Heldar, manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist. I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. But here he is not heroic. In fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others. It does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social.\n\nTo me Colman should have gotten the Oscar for Heldar, or Carton, or Conway - all more typical of his acting roles. But the Academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members. Colman's Anthony John is a very good performance, and at one point truly scary. When alone with Signe Hasso in her home, she at the top of a staircase and him at the base, they have an argument. She demands that \"Tony\" leave, saying she won't see him. He stares at her, his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before, and he says, \"Oh, no you won't!\" He starts moving upstairs, frightening Hasso, and she runs into her room. He stops himself and leaves. It actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of Hasso on stage, or of Edmond O'Brien, or his killing of Shelley Winters. It showed his blind fury. For that moment it was (to me) an Oscar-worthy performance. But it is only that moment. I'm glad he was recognized for the role, but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance.\n\nHis actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great, but bearable. Too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style (one wonders if that was due to the coaching of Walter Hampden, who probably knew how to handle the role properly, or a reaction to it). Nowadays \"Othello\" is played by an African American actor more frequently than a white one. Paul Robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place. But the three best known movie performances of the part are those of Colman, Orson Welles in his movie of OTHELLO, and Laurence Olivier in his movie of his play production of OTHELLO. All three white actors did the role in black face. My personal favorite of the three is Welles, who seems the most subtle. But even watching Welles' fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance (with Jose Ferrer as Iago) on film.\n\nNow the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role? I heard different things about this. Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set. Others have found a role they have to be stimulating, influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life. But actually I have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role. It seems a melodramatic, hackneyed idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor, Kanin, and Gordon. In 1944 a \"B\" feature, THE BRIGHTON STRANGLER, starring John Loder, had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous \"Jack the Ripper\" type, and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind. There was an earlier movie in the 1930s, in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife (I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS, but I'm not sure). But due to Colman's name and career, and Cukor's directing, it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea. It even reached comedy (finally) on an episode of CHEERS, where Diane Chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent, and they put on OTHELLO at the bar, just after he sees her with Sam Malone kissing. Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict, and can't delay the production long enough (she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play). \n\nThe cast of A DOUBLE LIFE was first rate, and Cukor's direction was as sure as ever.

Like Cassavetes and Scorsese, the viewing experience of the film is very physical and tough on the audience.\n\nAnthony John(Ronald Colman) is a respected and admired thespian on Broadway. He stars regularly alongside his ex-wife but still very much committed live-in girlfriend, Brita(Signe Hasso). Their relationship which endures both a marriage and a divorce is hampered by Tony John's extreme commitment to his acting, the ability with which he becomes his characters hampers his sense of reality and enters his private life. This comes to the front tragically when he undertakes the role of Othello with Brita as his Desdemona and performs the part for two years non-stop. Othello's rage and insecurity feeds on his own insecurity at his press-agent Bill(Edmond O'Brien), who has a thinly disguised attraction to Brita. His attempts to escape it involve an affair with a waitress(Shelley Winters) and a constant battle with his own mind to hold on to his sanity.\n\nThe baroque Pirandellian plot of this film is an ultimate test on the actors. Ronald Colman more than deserves one of the few just Oscar victories for his performance. It's a performance on a big scale and he more than commands the screen. A great example is the first performance as Othello. After an exceptional montage of theater rehearsals where we see Tony slowly creating his character we see the death of Desdemona scene on-stage and the acting is so natural that we actually see Othello and not Tony John act as Othello. Signe Hasso is very good as Brita showing an intelligence and sexuality to her part. Edmon O'Brien on the other hand is a real surprise. Aided by a great script, he reveals new details about a dramatically conventional character in each scene.\n\nGeorge Cukor made ''A Double Life'' independently through Garson Kanin's production company. Kanin who was Cukor's lifelong friend and frequent collaborator also wrote the script, which was undoubtedly influenced from his own experiences on Broadway. As a result it's much tougher and sober than other Cukor films made at studios, also showing a more direct take on sexuality. Cukor's direction of this film is totally against the grain of people who see him as a theatrically oriented film-maker. The visual style shows a rich use of black-and-white and chiaroscuro reflected through window-blinds that is associated with Film Noir(to which it qualifies as a decidedly outr\u00e9 example). But the classic Cukor mise-en-scene, the movement in-and-out of frame, the blocking and cutting immediately shows his personal stamp on every frame of the film.\n\nThis is one of his richest and most personal films although atypical as per his image. Cukor is often associated with a lightness that's totally absent here, with sophisticated humour and wit. Yet ''A Double Life'' picks up from ''Gaslight'' which also dealt with insanity by adduced-illusions and paves the way for ''A Star is Born''. The press scenes here are a dry run for the latter film. It's also one of the many films Cukor made on actors, dealing with acting including ''Born Yesterday'', ''The Actress'', ''Sylvia Scarlett'', ''My Fair Lady'' and many others.

Usually he takes it as his charter to get out of the way and let an actress (usually an actress) shine or more often to let the wheels of the studio machine turn.\n\nThis may be his most distinctively personal film. And its a gem of sorts.\n\nIts from a time when actors put tremors into their lines and punctuating hesitations into their movements to denote gravitas. Its a tradition from 19th century Shakespearian productions, or at least became associated with them.\n\nAnd going with this here is some very careful staging and blocking. Very, very highly composed, abstract and theatrical. Its worth watching because of the simple craft of the thing. Its excellently shaped.\n\nBut the story, and the way it weaves among all the production threads is quite special. And that is why I would like to recommend this to you.\n\nThe story is rather simple: an actor is intense, so intense that the personality of his characters tends to take over his own. The war between identities isn't a war at all; he just doesn't like himself, sees no sense in himself. His roles offer solidity, sense, so they color his world.\n\nHe gets talked into doing an Othello and the character takes over his life. Blackouts and all that. At this level, it is just another Jekyll and Hyde deal, and might have been as banal as the Spencer Tracy belch. But the blurring of what we see on stage and screen is blurred so effectively. In the way the actors carry themselves. In the lighting and even set dressing.\n\nAnd in the story of course. His \"real\" wife/loving exwife is his Desdemona. There's a folding between her screen and stage characters. Lest we not be locked in that simple two-layer structure, we have her merged with a promiscuous waitress. Its really quite deft.\n\nUnderneath is another layer, overtly racist. That the moor is black is never mentioned, though of course he is dark makeup. But the idea (this is the 40's now) is that of all the characters he has played and whose possession he has mastered, this one overtakes him with an uncontrollable negroid passion. Its a notion explicit in many productions of Othello of course, and is played here.\n\nEven though it is never mentioned in terms of humans, see how the notion is spoken. Four or five times a scene begins with the principle characters and then slides off into apparently random conversations of surrounding folks. Exclusively, the conversation is about the dangers of adding white stuff (milk or cream) to black stuff (coffee).\n\nYou might not even notice it, so deft is the introduction. Smooth and ghastly.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

At some point in the past, she got him to take his career seriously - advice he took a little too much to heart, the two married, and then divorced. Brita's encouragement resulted in Tony immersing himself in a role, which was OK when he was playing a comedy, but the darker the role the darker Tony John's alter-ego would get, which is what caused the divorce in the first place. When Tony Johns decides to play Othello, his darkest mood yet comes over him, focusing upon the jealousy he has for the relationship between his ex-wife and a journalist (Edmond O'Brien) who is in love with her.\n\nColman plays his role superbly as he is a complex villain with whom you can very much sympathize. Instead, woman-to-woman, it is Hasso's Brita that I would like to slap around in a room for about half an hour - she is leading an emotionally troubled man on and being a great big tease when, for her, the relationship is forever over. It's never clear why she still hangs around giving the guy hope and acting all lovey dovey when she's got to know how Tony still feels, plus she knows his trouble distinguishing reality from the plays in which he stars. If she's the accomplished actress she appears to be, she could get other roles and clear out of Tony's life, yet she just won't make a clean break of it and let the guy heal. Thus she's shocked...shocked I say!...when her \"I'm just out of your reach\" routine almost turns to murder one night with a confused and enraged Tony/Othello staggering off into the night saying \"must..not...hurt...Brita\". Who does he hurt? Watch and find out.\n\nAlthough this was a great role for Colman and surely worthy of a Best Actor Oscar, he had so many other roles that were superb too. From the silent era, to his adventurous early sound years when his voice boosted his fame considerably, on to more serious roles in the later 30's and 40's, it's almost like the Academy wasn't sure what Colman's last film role would be and didn't want to lose an opportunity to reward him. This is one film I don't get tired of - it's one of my personal favorites. It has great performances by the entire cast, a couple of big names just starting out, Colman winding down in a superb film career and basically going out on top, and an atmosphere that fits the film's complex mood like a glove.

At our first glimpse of Anthony we catch him looking at portraits of previous characters he has played. Turning to face the camera in a medium close up with a seemingly playful expression on his face. We just like the rest of the characters are yet to be aware of what really hides behind his playful expression. The signs of his complexity become more apparent. \"You're two men now, urging for control\", Anthony's frequent outburst of monologues, his voice shifting in tone showing the battle of his changing personality. The motifs of mirrors in which Anthony looks into as he changes form makes the audience aware of his personality shifts are extremely effective due to Coleman's performance. His way of immediately changing his facial expressions in an alarming manner and his voice range is to perfection.\n\nThis of course is also benefited by the technical elements of A Double Life. Miklos Rozsa's score with its operatic sounds slowly building higher in volume as Anthony walks around disturbed by what he hears makes for several tremendous scenes. The cinematography of Milton R. Krasner should also get a worthy mention with multiple well placed close ups of Anthony at his most disturbed, showing us in detail the horrific glimpse in his eyes and the haunting expressions which make Anthony monstrous to the audience. However we are not only shown the differences in character of Anthony within his own physical and mental capacity but also with his interactions with others.\n\nMost notably with Brita, his actor partner and former companion. She is the catalyst for showcasing his behaviour becoming the source of drama and tragedy in which Signe Hasso is on par with Coleman as a woman who shows undying loyalty to Anthony while also becoming vulnerable around him. In one memorable scene they passionately kiss lying in each other's arms reminiscing the past. When Brita mentions another man having affection for her Anthony suddenly turns aggressive. Raising his voice in anger and changing his posture to that of a predator who quickly attempts to pounce on Brita. Such a scene fills A Double Life with absorbing drama that makes it a quality feature. Brita's weakness creates feelings of unease towards Anthony whilst showing the extent of Anthony's emotional fatigue. Any film which makes us both be wary and sympathetic for the amoral lead is of high standard.\n\nOnce Anthony's complexity leads to murder the narrative shifts from character \u0096 oriented to a gripping investigation. The change continues to make A Double Life brilliant to watch as it brings in the element of tension between Anthony and Bill, a press agent working alongside Anthony who also has feelings for Brita. All these elements conclude in an equally terrific and tragic end as Anthony reaches his demise with suicide making for an emotional finale.

After years of playing a wide range of parts, he can't remember who he exactly is--who are his roles and who is the self. And, much more serious, he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life. So, since he's currently playing in \"Othello\", he begins to act jealous and suspicious--just like the title character. Ultimately, it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder.\n\nI saw this film years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because I have always liked Ronald Colman and this is a great triumph for him--and for which he earned the Best Actor Oscar. And, looking at the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA), I think Colman was a very good choice, as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role.\n\nNow I noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated Shakespeare--and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him. However, this film isn't really about Shakespeare, and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare. I am no huge fan of Shakespeare, but marveled at the small portions of the play that Colman re-enacted--though, as I said, this is NOT a really movie about Shakespeare. Instead, it's a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. It could have been ANY play, though \"Othello\" was an excellent choice because of the murder scene--which gets acted out for real later in the film.\n\nOverall, a very clever film due to a lovely script--with some overtones of Film Noir. Fortunately, the acting was terrific also, as Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O'Brien (who was particularly good--he played his part just right).

The script by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon is brilliant, mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" as a reference to both the film's main theme of jealousy and Colman's character's obsession with identity.\n\nSeveral interesting things about this movie \u0096 superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors. In other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets. But I don't really think this story's primary concern is acting or the job/art of acting per se. I think Anthony's struggles represents a broader existential question, a deeply buried uncertainty about identity. There's a key, I feel, in his relationship with his ex-wife Britta (Signe Hasso). He says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration. And at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her. I'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me, especially because it's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top. Perhaps the implication is that Anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship. Marriage implies a \"union of the soul\" in the traditional conception. It's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film. It's not completely unprecedented (Hawks' comedy \"His Girl Friday\" springs to mind, among others), but it is unusual and probably significant, especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation. In a way, the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self-love.",

The best scenes in the movie do not involve either of these two, but feature either Coleman alone or with Winters.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the script also. It's fine in most places, but there's that little place that makes you cringe, like when Coleman says to Winters, \"His name wasn't Bill was it?\" It's a crime to put a line like that in this movie, but there are enough of them to make it a little less than great, little more than very good.",

As Anthony John, the Broadway star whose characterization of Othello eventually consumes him, he turns in a powerful performance, highlighted by George Cukor's sensitive direction. He begins the film in his familiar urbane manner, but as the strain of portraying such a role gets the better of him, so he begins to become more hysterical in the delivery of his lines. Through an intelligent use of voice-over, that compliments the actor's increasingly disheveled appearance, director Cukor shows art and life become totally confused in his mind, as he consciously mistakes the young server Pat Kroll (Shelley Winters) for Desdemona, with tragic consequences. A DOUBLE LIFE is a visual feast, intelligently photographed by Milton Krasner; the repeated shot of the theater curtain rising and falling - often in shadow - reminds us of how much the stage dominates Anthony's life, as well as signaling the film's denouement. In a series of two-shots, the shadows keep falling across the faces of the women in Anthony's life - his ex-wife (and costar in the Othello production)) Brita (Signe Hasso), Pat Kroll - suggesting that their lives are somehow fated through association with the star. Designer Harry Horner's sets are lush yet threatening, the heavy furniture pressing in upon Anthony as he tries to make sense of an increasingly disordered life; there are several close-ups of his face shot against the shadows of the banisters, suggesting imprisonment. In a strategy that foreshadows a similar technique in THE HEIRESS (1949), also designed by Horner, Anthony is shown climbing stairs, suggesting that he has mental as well as physical levels to contend with. The fact that he fails in this task draws further attention to his disordered state of mind. The actual performance of \"Othello\" is somewhat stagy, with the actors standing and declaiming their lines in a conscious evocation of late nineteenth century styles of production. However this technique gives Cukor the opportunity to focus on the actors in close- up, especially Colman and Hasso, as Hasso realizes (to her horror) that her death-scene as Desdemona might be taking place for real. A DOUBLE LIFE is a powerful film, showing the lengths to which actors can go to give a truthful performance, and how it can affect their mental state.",

Consider:\n\nAnthony John is meant to be among the two or three greatest actors in the world.  This alone means that Colman has his work cut out for him.  Then there's the WAY in which Tony is meant to be great: he's meant to BECOME the people he plays on stage; that is, really adopt their psychological tendencies, and even their beliefs, as his own.  (Stanislavsky claims that this is what all actors should do, but such claims are best taken either not seriously or not literally.)\n\nBut when we see Colman play John play Othello, he's holding back - or, what amounts to the same thing in context, hamming it up.  It's as if Cukor was afraid that Anthony John's performance as Othello would outshine Ronald Colman's performance as Anthony John, and so placed an upper bound on how good he former could be in order to prevent this.  In a way his fear was justified.  \"Othello\" is a better play than \"A Double Life\" is a movie, and a good screen production of \"Othello\" would be a better MOVIE than \"A Double Life\" is a movie, and Othello is a more interesting character than Anthony John.  But dulling the edge of \"Othello\" only makes \"A Double Life\" worse - even though it might make it LOOK comparatively better.\n\nI said Colman's Oscar was misplaced but not undeserved because his performance, as Tony, is still good, and he integrates Tony-as-Tony with Tony-as-Othello as well, I suppose, as anyone could have.  But he's been cast in a role where he would have had to soar to the heavens AS OTHELLO in order to pull it off, and he doesn't.\n\nProduction values are high, Cukor's direction is assured, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's score seems average by his standards (although R\u00f3zsa himself was proud of it; no doubt I'm missing something) ... in short, we've been given all that we'd have had a right to demand of a top-notch 1940s MGM production made by these particular people.  It's a decent effort.  It's just not a very interesting story of role confusion.\n\nI'm puzzled by the choice of \"Othello\" as a source play.  Othello, as everyone knows, has been manipulated into FALSELY suspecting his wife of adultery.  Tony knows this, too.  Why doesn't he remember how the play ends?  In fact, the play is more about racism than it is about jealousy per se (if Othello hadn't been constantly made aware of the fact that he was an outsider, nothing tragic would have happened) - which means that Tony's circumstances and Othello's shed almost no light on one another.  Where connections between the play and real life are loose, excessive madness must take up the slack, and excessive madness simply isn't as fascinating as just a little madness.  It would have been better if they'd tailored a play to the needs of the movie and had Tony perform in that.",

Moreover the basic plot-line (fictional murder turns an actor's brain) is both hackneyed (e.g. \"The Brighton Strangler\") and overwrought: there is mileage to be had in the idea of constant performance undermining one's own sense of identity, and indeed the film makes some interesting points about it, but this particular twist is more usually the territory of the cheap thriller.\n\nBut instead of, say, the House of Hammer and Peter Cushing (himself with genuine Shakespearian credentials: an equal 'gentleman' of the cinema, he could well have handled the part) we get the likes of George Cukor and Miklos Rosza charged with the task of producing Oscar-fodder from it in full Hollywood panoply -- with the more than able assistance of former matin\u00e9e idol Ronald Colman playing former matin\u00e9e idol Anthony John, who enjoys one of those complicated theatrical relationships with Brita, his dearest friend, chief support network, motherly/sisterly protector, sometime lover -- and ex-wife.\n\nIf the plot of this film leaves it with a heavy burden to carry (even with a generous measure of assistance from the Bard, both on- and off-stage), then it is the characters who carry it through. Colman and Signe Hasso have real chemistry together, and the scenes between Tony and Brita are perhaps the most convincing as well as the most enjoyable in the film: their relationship is almost that of an old married couple (which, of course, they are...) with a tormenting edge of sexual tension -- Brita's housekeeper doesn't turn a hair when her employer's ex-husband shows up (yet again?) unannounced at the breakfast table, but Brita evidently hasn't been allowing him to graduate beyond the sofa, despite their unchanged mutual attraction, while not all the \"one-night stands\" Tony deplores to his manager would appear to have been theatrical ones... As a depiction of a couple who can't live together and can't live apart it doesn't really need the cheap melodrama trappings, but it is in Miss Hasso's company that Colman comes closest to being able to pull off the plot with psychological conviction.\n\n(An earlier reviewer refers to their scene on the stairs -- where we sense for the first time that Tony may be dangerous -- as without doubt the most effective part of Colman's performance, and I would agree. At this point in the film, knowing nothing about it, I felt that it had the potential to develop into a great drama: sadly the later sections caused me to revise my overall verdict downwards.) \n\nIn the rather thankless role of Bill Friend, the press agent who finds himself the object of Tony's Othello-esque jealousy, Edmond O'Brien also has an outstanding scene with Signe Hasso, as Bill is forced -- in what is almost a throwaway line, beautifully judged -- to admit the truth to the woman for whom he does not allow himself to hope. Little more than a bit-part player for the majority of the picture, Bill suddenly finds himself elevated into a B-movie private detective role by the mechanics of the plot in the final section, and goes through the necessary movements in an adequate by-the-book manner; but this is not really the actor's fault.\n\nA young Shelley Winters has a small but memorable part as brassy waitress Pat, who pulls off a blatant pick-up on the middle-aged gent who gets into her proprietor's good books and may therefore be able to offer her 'connections' -- only to take alarm at his habit of reciting poetry to himself and his decidedly unusual behaviour. As Miss Winters makes clear, the two of them are worlds apart; but unfortunately Tony's own two worlds aren't quite separated enough to save both Brita and Pat...\n\nRonald Colman, of course, revels in the verse-speaking, the chance to present an Othello reminiscent of Olivier's later tour-de-force, and the chance to display the actor's craft, all the way from \"Anyone for tennis\" to heavyweight Shakespearian technique. Little use is made here, alas, of his gift for rueful humour, soon to be demonstrated to such effect in \"Champagne for Caesar\", but he can simultaneously evoke both wordplay and genuine feeling: (Brita)\"Be a good friend and stay a while\" -- (Tony) \"I'm afraid I can't do either...\" His 'mad scene' at the first-night reception is very effective, but even Colman's acting can't really make subsequent plot developments believable. His finale scene, as a man in physical pain but finally freed from his mental agony, is stagy but characteristically underplayed; and while this film would seem to be yet another case of the adage that the way to get an Oscar is to 'play crippled' (and/or the technical challenge of a good/evil twin role), Colman does his best here to make the picture work with the material he is given, aided most notably by the teaming with Signe Hasso, who proves a more than admirable foil.\n\nFor all the essentially cheap thrills of its plot, \"A Double Life\" manages to make a memorable effect thanks to adventurous cinematography, evocative grasp of Broadway backstage and a well-drawn cast of involving characters (many of whom have only one or two scenes in which to shine). It's just that the talent involved ended up being hung on what was so basically frail a structure, alas.",

Unfortunately, Ms. Wilson gets involved with two con men, smooth-talking Allen Jenkins (as \"Tip\" Bailey) and his well-suited partner Charley Foy (as \"Jinx\" Donovan). After she is fleeced, Wilson gets a waitressing job. She is hired after hinting she may be available for dating after hours, on Saturday nights, with romantically-inclined boss Johnnie Davis (as Mark Downe). Wilson's luck changes with a winning \"Irish Sweepstakes\" ticket. In a highlight, she makes her serving tray fly. Wilson is able to buy \"Firefly\", but sneaky Mr. Jenkins wants to take further advantage...\n\nJenkins hits all the marks, and likely adds some of his own, in this otherwise routine comedy. With his distinctive voice, the character actor was dependable, for decades, in this type of role. Wilson is cute and bubbly; at times, you wonder if Judy Garland borrowed some of her delivery. Mugging jockey Frankie Burke (as \"Chalky\" Williams) has a couple of good scenes and, as a concerned landlady, veteran Vera Lewis gets to share some of her acid-tongue. Among the extras, it's interesting to see John Harron get some lines and screen time. The brother of silent D.W. Griffith \"silent\" star Robert Harron, John is the fast-talking Narragansett racetrack announcer. Diner chef Jerry Colonna rolls his eyes. All told, director William McGann neatly corrals the second-string cast and crew at Warner Bros.\n\n****** Sweepstakes Winner (5/20/39) William McGann ~ Marie Wilson, Allen Jenkins, Johnnie Davis, Charley Foy",

Johnnie Davis gets the honor of being Marie's main squeeze, and he's okay in it. This is a fun little comedy, breezing right along with lots of exteriors and it's safe to say that if you like Marie's wide-eyed innocent persona, you'll not be disappointed. Racetrack films have inherent tension, and along with the tension provided by Jenkins as a scheming racetrack hanger-on, nails will be bitten. One scene stands out, whether Marie's or the director's idea, I don't know: on the way to meeting her dream horse, Marie and Jenkins skip side-by-side merrily down to the corral, along with Jenkins' friend Charley Foy and Granville Bates (!) It was spontaneous and cute as a sight gag. \n\nAll in all, a 'silly' comedy as another reviewer has said, and rated 8 for excellent use of Marie and Jenkins and the racetrack milieu. Extra appreciation for Bates as a not-very-nice schemer of grandpa vintage, Jerry Colonna as a hilarious cook, and Sam McDaniel as the plot instrument ensuring that Marie's horse win its most important race. More applause for Frankie Burke, a Cagney lookalike who seems to have led a life with Cagney's bravado. At any rate, he resembles and sounds like Cagney to a remarkable degree.",

It's the type of comedy I never did like.  If it weren't for the ever-reliable Allen Jenkins and his savvy comedy, this movie would be a total bust.  I did enjoy Jerry Colonna in his all-too-small role as a chef, and Frankie Burke, mostly because his normal way of talking sounds like James Cagney in all his roles.\n\nPerhaps Marie Wilson was not putting on an act.

This was an image Republic Pictures cultivated--and over the years, his films became more and more kids-oriented. For me, this is a problem. His earlier films seemed less schmaltzy and I really didn't like the cute kids and schmaltzy plots (such as one where he stops bad guys from stealing Christmas trees!). However, \"Ridin' Down the Canyon\" managed to have a very kids-oriented plot but it still worked very well. I think one of the big reason was that the music was much better than usual--with Roy's Sons of the Pioneers at their very best.\n\nThe plot involves a boy, Bobby, and his sister. Their horses keep getting rustled (a VERY common plot in the Rogers films) and the boy sneaks off to find Roy because he KNOWS Roy can help him. However, in an odd case where art and real life converge, in this one Roy is a movie and radio star and because it's NOT the old west, he's not sure what he and his band can do. Will Roy just give up on the kid or will he somehow find a way to restore the child's faith in the wonderfulness of the Rogers mystique? So, the film has great music, great support from Gabby Hayes and it's fun. So, even with the cutesy kid, it's still among the better films of the genre.",

Roy becomes suspicious when later that evening he finds local rancher Burt Wooster (James Seay) at the scene of the rustling. Roy then sets out to find if Wooster might be involved and how this ties to the Lariat Lodge and it's owner Gus Jordan and his hostess Barbara Joyce (Addison Richards and Lorna Gray).\n\nThis one is a treat for any Roy Roger's fan, there's action to keep the story moving along with thoughtfully placed songs including the title track \"Ridin' Down the Canyon\" and \"Blue Prairie\" from Roy and the Son's of the Pioneers. Comedic relief is furnished via Pat Brady and Gabby Hayes with a running gag where each is told the other one is deaf. It's as much what this movie doesn't have as what it does have. No lavish costumed musical sets with orchestras and no action stopping slapstick comedy. If you want to know why Gabby Hayes is considered the iconic western sidekick watch this movie. A lot of the credit has to go to the dialog and screenplay by Republic Studios veteran Albert DeMond and Norman Houston. The script seems like it could have been custom written for Gabby who is almost a second lead in this one giving Roy the opportunity to what he does best, just be Roy.\n\nAfter watching \"Ridin Down the Canyon\" it's hard to figure out why Republic Studios decided to tamper with such a successful format. After this movie and for the next several years Roy's simple, straight-forward westerns ever increasingly became theatrical musicals that bore less and less resemblance to his earlier releases. This movie is a perfect example of if ain't broke don't fix it. \n\nTop flight Roy Rogers B-western 9 out of 10 *",

For example, the name of Buzz Henry's character in the picture goes by Bobby Blake, and I thought to myself, wouldn't it have been cool if the REAL Bobby Blake (Robert Blake, that is) was cast as a character with his own name? It would have been possible too, since the young Buzz Henry was eleven years old when he appeared in the picture. At the time, Blake (the real one) would have been nine, so it probably wouldn't have been too much of a stretch to make that happen. Instead, Blake (the real one) made his mark in Westerns as Red Ryder's sidekick in the series of movies that started with \"Riders of Death Valley\" in 1944; Blake was Ryder's sidekick Little Beaver.\n\nThen there's Roy Rogers' title song that's first heard as a recording when Bobby spins a couple of tunes on his record player. I thought that was pretty unique, at least it was the first time I'd seen that done to introduce the lead player. Rogers himself doesn't appear for a few more scenes, so that was a cool way to get his presence into the movie a bit earlier.\n\nA good deal of the fun in this one is provided by a running feud between Gabby Hayes and Pat Brady as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers. Each believes the other is deaf based on false information intentionally planted by Roy and Bob Nolan, so they go through the picture shouting at each other in comic fashion. Brady provides some more merriment when he gets to sing lead in a jail house tune later in the story. As for Gabby, he tries hard to build on his reputation as a 'professional rustler catcher', even if one wonders how many rustlers there might have been in that hazy modern Western era where 1880's sensibility collides with such technology as automobiles, radio and electrical appliances. The 1940's was a curious time for Westerns as this stuff pops up all the time in the films of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, but it usually turns out fairly entertaining as it does here.\n\nIf you hadn't figured it out by now (unless you've seen the film), the story involves a gang of rustlers operating in a milieu where wild herds are being rounded up on reservations and bred with ranch thoroughbreds as part of a government experiment. The rustlers spring into action whenever a particular song is played during the Lariat Lodge entertainment broadcast. Inadvertently, the Pioneers are drawn into this ruse when they perform \"Blue Prairie\" during a one night stand at the Lodge. That actually rounds out another interesting point about the movie's principal players - when introduced, the singing group is introduced as Roy Rogers and the Sons of The Pioneers. I hope Bob Nolan didn't feel too bad about that one!",

In this film Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers are entertainers as well as cowboys and have signed for a gig at the Lariat Lodge owned by Addison Richards and hosted by Lorna Gray. But that's only a blind because Richards makes his real money in horse rustling. Which puts him in opposition to Forrest Taylor who is leading a reclamation project to save the wild horses and preserve them in their natural habitat. If you remember The Misfits you know what some view the wild horse as good for.\n\nYoung Buzz Henry is a big fan of Roy on the radio and after his own horse named Trigger Jr. is rustled by these varmints and he runs into Roy he asks for help. Roy if nothing else is obliging to his fans.\n\nMusic for Ridin' Down The Canyon is culled from several sources. Roy sings My Little Buckaroo which was introduced by Dick Foran over at Warner Brothers and Herbert J. Yates must have plunked down some big cash to get it for this film. The old Twenties classic In A Little Spanish Town is sung nicely by Roy. And the title song is also sung well and also was a nice record for Bing Crosby.\n\nGabby Hayes who says he's a professional rustler catcher has some nice moments with future Rogers sidekick Pat Brady who is starting to work his way up from The Sons Of The Pioneers as Roy himself had. Brady was a very funny fellow both in film and in the Roy Rogers television show.\n\nNothing like having a child shown that his hero is all he thinks he is. Those are the happiest endings of all for the front row Saturday matin\u00e9e kids yesterday and today. Which is another reason why Ridin' Down The Canyon still holds up well.",

When the rustlers steal a herd from Alice Blake, her kid brother Bobbie, sets out to get help from his radio favorites, Roy Rogers, King of the Cowboys, and the Sons of the Pioneers, who are en route to Lariat Lodge to play a one-night stand. While riding down the road with Gabby Whittaker, who has given him a ride in his jalopy, Bobbie sees three men who he recognizes as rustlers and, when he tries to stop them, they begin beating him with whips. His life is saved by the timely arrival of Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers. On the way to take Bobbie back to his sister, who is at the Fellows Ranch, they run into the rustlers on a raid, and take Burt Wooster and Pete prisoners. Wooster, the foreman at the Fellows Ranch, is actually an accomplice working for Jordan. He insists that he is not a gang member and Roy, pretending to believe him, agrees to let him take Pete to Sheriff Brite. Unaware that Roy and the Sons are following, Wooster and Pete go straight to the Lariat Lodge, where Wooster, after announcing that he is quitting, soon learns that he should have gone to the Sheriff with Pete, because Jordan and Pete shoot him. He lives long enough to tell Roy that the signal for a rustler raid is the playing of a certain song over the Lodge's nightly radio program."

                "text": "John Wayne's first non-western after his breakthrough role with Stagecoach was with his Stagecoach co-star Claire Trevor and is what I would call a colonial. For myself I've always thought of westerns as films that are located west of the Mississippi and this one isn't even west of the Appalachians. Nevertheless it's a good follow-up film to Stagecoach and the first of about two dozen loan outs that Republic's Herbert J. Yates charged for the Duke's services. This one was made under the RKO banner.\n\nNeil Swanson's novel The First Rebel was the source for this film and later on in a film based in the same post Seven Year's War American colonial period, Cecil B. DeMille would make a big budgeted spectacle of another of Swanson's novels, turning The Judas Tree into Unconquered.\n\nRKO didn't quite put the production values of a DeMille film into Allegheny Uprising, but it still is a good action film and a plus on John Wayne's career.\n\nWhat Alleghany Uprising shows are some of the seeds of the American Revolution. The Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years War which was known on the North American continent as the French and Indian War gave generous peace terms to the Indians. The British took over the French guarantees of no white settlement west of the Appalachians. That was easier said than done.\n\nJohn Wayne is the leader of a group of settlers located in the Alleghany river area and he's pretty upset that trade is still permitted with the tribes. Brian Donlevy and Ian Wolfe are a pair of unscrupulous traders who are devilishly shrewd in gaining their objectives. They play British captain George Sanders like a violin, stirring him up against Wayne and the settlers. Of course the trade goods that Donlevy and Wolfe are peddling consist of rum and tomahawks.\n\nGeorge Sanders has the key role in this film. He really does represent the worst of the British military character. Not a bad person at heart really, but pigheaded and stubborn with not a clue as to how he's being tricked and used by Donlevy and Wolfe. Usually Sanders whether playing villains or heroes is usually someone of intelligence. This was a radical departure for him, but he carries it off.\n\nSanders also represents in microcosm the type that in dealing with the American colonies created the climate for the American Revolution down the road. The key scene in the film is when Wayne remarks how Sanders just refuses to understand the settlers and their ways.\n\nClaire Trevor plays a colonial Calamity Jane, a real frontier girl who is both in love and exasperated with the Duke. A nice follow-up for her to the almost tragic Dallas in Stagecoach.\n\nYou'll see such stalwart supporting characters as Chill Wills who has a song to sing in this first film with John Wayne, Wilfrid Lawson, Eddie Quillan, Olaf Hytten, and Robert Barrat. Barrat is my favorite among the supporting cast. There's a court martial in the climax scene where the very shrewd Mr. Barrat who is the civil magistrate in the area, turns defense lawyer and with some interesting ballistic evidence turns the tables on the villains.\n\nThe Pennsylvania farmers were one independent lot. Not to be forgotten is the fact that this area in refusing to pay the tax on whiskey, precipitated the first challenge to U.S. government authority thirty years later in the Whiskey Rebellion. Of course George Washington was shrewd enough to use just the right amount of authority in dealing with the situation.",

It is a somewhat forgotten film, but it doesn't deserve to be, since it tells a really good story in a really entertaining fashion.  And it has a great cast.\n\nWayne plays Jim Smith, leader of a band of settlers of southern Pennsylvania's Conococheague Valley in the years immediately following the French and Indian War.  Smith & Company's efforts to deal with a crooked Indian trader (veteran Hollywood villain Brian Donlevy) are hampered by an officious, pig-headed, and not-too-bright British Army officer (veteran Hollywood stuffed shirt George Sanders).  Smith also has to deal with the local tomboy (Miss Trevor) who has a deep yearning for adventure and excitement, as well as the affections of Jim Smith.\n\nWilfrid Lawson also appears as MacDougall, the rowdy Scotsman who loves fighting almost as much as drinking.  John F. Hamilton is the eloquent but enigmatic sidekick, known as the Professor.  Moroni Olsen, possessor of one of filmdom's coolest names, is the stalwart Tom Calhoon.  Veteran second-string Hollywood villain Ian Wolfe is the evil trader's Evil sidekick.  Also appearing in small roles are Chill Wills (another cool name) and Charles Middleton, heretofore best known as the stone-faced Fredonian prosecutor in \"Duck Soup\".\n\nInteresting historical detail: in a courtroom scene, a witness is asked to \"swear or affirm\" that what he's about to say is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  This should serve to remind the viewer that Pennsylvania was a Quaker Commonwealth.  (Quakers don't believe in swearing, you see...)",

                "text": "\nI watched this film because, after seeing THE PATRIOT (2000), I wanted to see an another perspective on the American Revolution.\n\n\nThe contrast is refreshing. Whereas Mel Gibson and his bunch of cut-throats often sound and act as if they had come straight out of THE TURNER DIARIES, John Wayne and his own band of irregulars live according to the principles of another gospel - that of law and order, western style. The film is indeed a western, in spite of the geographical and historical settings - the mountains of Western Pennsylvania, 15 years before the Boston Tea Party. More specifically, it is a glorified version of the typical B-movie western of the era, which often starred John Wayne, was often shot in exactly the same locations, and always featured the same formulaic story-line and motley collection of stock characters, such as the soft-spoken community leader, the wild mountaineer who talks and acts so funny, the tomboy love interest, who would like so much to be treated like a guy, but cannot, because she is *only* a girl, etc.  The main difference, of course, is one of scale and production value : this is not a cheaply mid-length program filler, but a full-blown feature film in which enough talent and production value has been invested to sustain interest from the beginning to the end, even some 60 years later - and this in spite of a few dated scenes and some awkward moments of political incorrectedness (e.g. the questionable philosophical adage \u00c7the only friendly Indian is a dead Indian\u00c8 is quoted approvingly).\n\nThe film, as suggested above, is based on the central classical theme of the western genre : the implementation of law and order on a wild and untamed country. In this case, however, the familiar story is told with a novel twist. The author of the screenplay has remembered that American law is, in fact, English law, but adapted to the peculiar circumstances of the new country. The pre-Revolutionary setting has provided him with an opportunity to oppose the two understandings of the same legal tradition - the new, American, understanding of English law represented by James Smith (John Wayne), a nation-builder and a free spirit who does not always play by the rules, but abides by the spirit of the law in his attempts to curb illegal liquor and arms trading with Indians, and the old, British, view, as represented by Captain Swanson (George Sanders) an upright, but unimaginative and incredibly obtuse military officer of a far-away Crown who does not seem to know of any other way to apply the law, but to the letter, regardless of common sense and consequences. In his own words : \u00c7I am a soldier, sir. They could have been carrying the murder of my own father if they had a permit for them. I would have defended them with my own life.\u00c8 The point of the story is both that the clash between the Britain and America was inevitable and that they would eventually be reconciled because of their deep shared faith in the same ideals of justice - ultimately, it will be observed, it is the British General Gage who steps in to resolve the dispute between soldiers and colonials in a remarkably fair and even-handed manner.\n\nWe are very far from the exercise in quasi-racist British-bashing characteristic of THE PATRIOT! However, the two films have this in common that they fail to make their British villain credible. In the case of THE PATRIOT, this is due both to Robert Rodat\u00d5s script - all in black and white - and the acting, for Jason Isaacs\u00d5 main asset, sad to say, seems to be his uncongenial face. George Sanders, on the other hand, is one of the greatest character actors specializing in villainy that Hollywood ever had. (Even his stints in BATMAN and THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. are very much worth seeing!) He had the face - and so much more : the style (\u00c7Remove this barbarian from the courtroom!\u00c8 - Who could have said it more contemptuously?) Unfortunately, there is little that he can do to lend genuine human substance to the cardboard unidimensional character entrusted to his art. The scriptwriter seems to have meant to depict a specimen of obdurate military stupidity (British style) closely patterned on the Captain Bligh of Charles Laughton from four years earlier (MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, Oscar for Best Picture in 1935), but, evidently, he lacked the means of his ambitions. Sanders still makes the best of the uneven material and he has his moments, most notably the scene when, besieged in his fort with his troops, Swanson orders that the soldiers who caught napping be flogged, and yet treats kindly the one man whom he actually finds sleeping on duty.

With all the sparkling jewels produced that year, such as Gone With The Wind, Goodbye, Mr. Chipps, The Private Lives Of Elizabeth And Essex, Union Pacific, Stagecoach, The Roaring Twenties, and Dodge City, RKO's relatively unambitious production Allegheney Uprising was just a pearl on the necklace. But this unpretentious yet stunningly beautiful picture of colonial life on the frontier and events setting the stage for the American Revolution is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nThis movie is an absolutely thrilling from the beginning to the end, one knockout scene after another, directed with precision and panache by William Seiter, almost non-stop action and drama. So breathtakingly fast paced yet so smoothly edited, it seems as if two hours worth of movie has been crammed into 80 minutes of running time. All is swept along by an rousing, grand operatic score by British composer Anthony Collins. Producer P. J. Wolfson's script is intelligent with sharp, colorful dialog consistent with Eighteenth Century speech patterns. Allegheney Uprising is beautifully photographed in the luminous, sensuous black and white common to pictures of this Golden Era. The sets and costumes are superb, painting an authentic picture of colonial frontier life. Those who say it should have been in color or that the colorized version is better need to wash out their mouths with a bar of colonial lye soap. The entire tone of the picture would have been changed, and it is virtually perfect as is.\n\nAllegheney Uprising is beautifully acted by a cast led by John Wayne and Claire Trevor. Both fresh from their triumph in Stagecoach, Wayne and Trevor must have been anxious to prove it wasn't a fluke, that they were in fact top star potential. Both do so in style. Wayne, as the leader of the Allegheney mountain region's \"lawful rebellion\" against British misrule, is much more relaxed, mature, and confident than in Stagecoach. While Stagecoach raised him to the ranks of stardom, Allegheney Uprising proved he was there to stay. Ms Trevor, as the leather-clad tomboy in love with Wayne, gives one of her liveliest and most charming performances, refreshingly unlike the hard-bitten moll which was her typical roll both previously and later. She was quoted as saying that an actress should never fall in love with her leading man, but that she always did. It is obvious here that in this their second picture together she and the young he-man Wayne have a \"simpatico\". In support George Sanders plays to perfection the stern, dutiful, aristocratic British Army officer antagonistic to the surly colonists, while Brian Donlevy provides his usual sneering villain as the rum and gun runner to the menacing heathen savages. But it is Wilfrid Lawson who virtually dominates the picture with his colorful, exuberant portrayal of Trevor's riotous, boozy, seldom-home father. Some will find his acting over-the-top, but his character as portrayed represents one of the messy but likable hard case types who were common on the early frontier and necessary for its settlement. Moroni Olsen, Robert Barrat, and Chill Wills add their always reliable support.\n\nAllegheney Uprising is a thrilling and beautifully realized picture of early America and the birth of our traditions of freedom and independence. It is a prime example of the craft of Old Hollywood movie making at its peak. Exhillirating, thoroughly enjoyable entertainment from the Golden Era. Highly recommended!",

Still, the producers popped for a bunch of extras with redcoats and also an impressive looking fort that even has realistic tree stumps indicating a cleared forest on the approaches.\n\nTo me, however, the movie's a disappointment. More importantly, the material shows why John Ford was such a master of this type of movie\u0097 that is,\"winning the West\" with roistering men and headstrong women, amusing drunks and slippery villains. The trouble here is that there's nothing humorous about the obnoxious drunk (Lawson), while Trevor in a padded part goes way over the top as a tomboy, but worse, she's allowed to interrupt the action just as it gets rolling. \n\nThe screenplay doesn't help either. Note that despite all the shooting and confrontations, no redcoat kills a colonist or vice-versa-- a rather strange outcome for an armed \"uprising\". My guess is that the pre-war year 1939 didn't want to show potential allies against the Nazis killing each other; then again, maybe American or British casualties would have complicated sorting out blame, which otherwise lies with the sneaky traders (Donlevy & Wolfe). Whatever the reason, it remains a pretty unbelievable development, given all the shooting. \n\nOn the other hand, Wayne shows potential as an outstanding leader of men, while Sanders is excellent as usual as a literate snob, this time an English officer. I did miss a strong Ward Bond-type as Wayne's buddy instead of the rather foolish professor (Hamilton). Anyway, the elements don't really gel into the kind of action movie that gets remembered.

She is Thwarted at every turn by the Macho Men. One of the many \"Comedy\" Scenes has Her almost Succeeding until She is told to take off Her Shirt (she is in disguise as a painted up Indian). Ha Ha.\n\nThis is a Movie where a lot of Guns are Fired but very few Hit their Target. Some of the time On Purpose. It has a Short Running Time and things move along briskly but not without some Clunk and Awkwardness. Trevor is Borderline Over the Top and Her Father's Happy Drunk anticipates John Ford's Fascination with the Type.\n\nOverall, George Sanders Steals the Show as a British Officer and His Contempt and Surprise at just how Defiant these Ruffians are is again, Comical, at times and it isn't meant to be. Wayne says at one point, and this is the whole purpose of This Thing, something like, \"I guess you Brits will never understand our ways.\"\n\nOverall, Worth a Watch for Wayne's Breakout Year, but the Film Feels all Wrong. Average or a Tad Below for its Kind, Time, and Place.",

After all, movies about Rome aren't made with everyone speaking Latin. As far as the way Claire Trevor dressed, well there is plenty of evidence that women on the fringes of civilization often dressed \"practical\",particularly young tomboyish ones Some people have referred to George Saunders as a \"villain\". Which he is not,Brian Donlevy and his men are the villains. He does cause trouble by his obvious contempt for the \"yokels\", and his insistence of going strictly by the book. But there is no doubt that if he had known Donlevy was violating the law by carrying forbidden goods,misusing his permit, that he would have arrested him on the spot. That is the one weak point in the plot. If when the fort surrendered, instead of having the troops march out and grabbing Donlevy and his men, Smith had exposed the whiskey kegs in the flour barrel and other frauds, the farmers could have left the fort and left Saunders in charge. Once Saunders had seen that Donlevy had deceived General Gage, and was desecrating the Royal permit in that way, he would never have protected the culprits.He was an honorable man, just stiff necked. He would have swallowed his pride and done his duty. This is a rousing movie about its times,and well captures the spirit that the colonials showed in those last days before the Revolution,and I think that it should not be judged too harshly on some of its technical shortcomings.",

Played almost along the lines of a typical B Western, the film's story line and production values are a slight notch above, with Claire Trevor joining Wayne in another film released the same year as \"Stagecoach\" in which they both appeared. Trevor's character here is not much more than a caricature, as she's constantly grumbling over her status as a woman who's not allowed to take part in the rough and tumble world the men around her find themselves in. Thinking about it now, she was the only woman in the entire picture; how realistic was that? \n\nIt struck me while watching that this was one film that probably would have benefited from the color treatment, what with all those Redcoats around causing dismay for the Allegheny settlers. Wayne's character Jim Smith and company rebel against the British for allowing trade to continue with marauding Indians, but except for one brief skirmish, the Indians aren't much of a factor in the story. It's those thieving, conniving traders in league with the Brits.\n\nIf nothing else, the film forced me to search my brain to recall bits and pieces I learned in parochial school about the French and Indian War and the new 'American' spirit of freedom and independence. With the story taking place a decade and a half prior to the Revolutionary War, it's a somewhat different kind of Western taking place East of the Mississippi with the good guys trading their white hats for coonskin caps.",

Few films have focused on this era and it was nice to see something different. The problem was that although it was a change of locale, the film itself seemed all too much like a typical cowboy and Indian film. So much of the dialog was actually identical to stuff you'd see in films set a hundred years later--only the tribes' names were changed. As a result, the film just tended to blend into the huge pile of John Wayne westerns--and not with the great ones like the Cavalry Trilogy or THE SEARCHERS but instead the mediocre ones made in the 30s and early 40s. Claire Trevor as Wayne's main squeeze was in some ways very good (it was nice to see a less passive style of woman) but in other ways she was a 1930s gal transported to 1758! Women in that era simply did NOT run around in men's clothes, out-shoot men and insist on being treated like \"one of the guys\". Since I am a history teacher, I found the film frustrating and completely anachronistic. For a much better film made around the same time about Colonial America, try watching the usually overlooked HOWARDS OF VIRGINIA--a Cary Grant film better in just about every way.",

He must have felt his career was going backwards as the production values here are second rate even by the marginal standards of his earlier films. Cast before the release of \"Stagecoach\", he and Trevor were given a more central role in \"Allegheny Uprising\" as it is not an ensemble piece like \"Stagecoach\". \n\nThe new popularity of the two B-Movie actors required P. J. Wolfson to alter his adaptation of Neil Swanson's novel \"The First Rebel\". In place of his straight historical fiction action- adventure tale (based on the Smith's Rebellion and Fort Loudoun in southern Pennsylvania) Wolfson was forced to add a romance and pad Trevor's role. Unfortunately adapting a novel to the screen is difficult enough without having to insert a character utterly irrelevant to a story already too expansive for easy adaptation. Contemporary viewers will find the forced insertion of Trevor into most of the scenes rather puzzling, at least in part because she has little going for herself as an actress or a screen presence. The younger John Wayne was much better when paired with talented leading ladies like Ella Raines and Cecilia Parker. \n\nSet in Pennsylvania's Conococheague Valley in 1759, Wayne plays title character James Smith who returns to the valley with a friend called The Professor (John Frank Hamilton). They find the local British commander (George Sanders) a martinet and a local civilian (Brian Donley) trading contraband goods (whiskey and weapons) with the Indians, in league with some corrupt soldiers. \n\nTrevor plays Janie MacDougall, a loud tomboy who loves Smith and manages to insert herself into his affairs at every turn. \n\n1939 was not a good time for a movie which portrayed our soon to be allies (insert the British here) as stupid and corrupt. And southern California was not a good location for shooting a film about colonial America. There are far too many shots of grassy, almost treeless, California valleys to maintain the necessary geographical illusion. Also jarring is the contemporary dialogue which leaves you expecting Mickey Rooney and Lewis Stone to pull up outside the fort in the family sedan. \n\nWhen not painful, the inattention to period detail is unintentionally amusing. My favorite scene involves the British soldiers laughing at the idea of the settlers taking over the fort. It will remind you of the \"Robin Huck\" episode of \"Huckleberry Hound\" where he exhorts his merry men to \"yuk it up a bit\" and they respond by going \"yuk, yuk, yuk\". \n\nAll in all, a weak example of the B-movie product. \n\nThen again, what do I know?

Anne Shirley plays Alice Fisher-the daughter of a small grocer who at the last minute gets to go to little Talbot College. On the train she learns that joining a sorority is an essential thing at the school. Unfortunately her late admission means that none of the sororities know about Alice and initially she is not even rushed. \n\nArriving at the train station she asks about sororities but is told by a snooty girl that they are by invitation only. There is an immediate credibility problem here-if you have seen any Anne Shirley movies you know that any sorority in the world would be clamoring to have her join. But the situation regains its lost credibility when Alice's plain Jane roommate Dotty (Barbara Read) calls her a date getter and tells her that the sororities will want her once they see her because she will attract men. You need looks and money to get into these organizations at Talbot and sometimes even that is not enough. Those who don't make it are called \"dreeps\".\n\nAlmost all the coeds are Hollywood starlets so a date getter seems irrelevant. Even Dotty has the starlet look, as do three nerd girls in the next room. They try to detune these girls by putting them in glasses and braiding their hair. Marge Champion and Veronica Lake have small parts as average coeds, which should make you wish that you had been the BMOC at Talbot. The actual BMOC is Bill Loomis (James Ellison), he wears a letter sweater and is actually a very nice guy. The Alice-Bill romance is the best part of the film and has a lot of Norman Rockwell charm.\n\nDoris Jordan plays Neva Simpson, the nasty queen bee of Gamma-the best sorority. She blackballs poor Merle (Pamela Blake) who is Alice's other roommate. Merle is devastated and suicidal. \n\nShirley was a wonderful actress, not just extremely beautiful but able to project an effortless likability. The film's best scene is her realization that in trying to impress the sorority girls she has hurt her father (J.M. Kerrigan). Beautiful nonverbal acting, which looks even better showcased in \"Sorority House\", where the other actresses are just not on her talent level.\n\n\"Sorority House\" is a little sappy and takes most of its shots at the low hanging fruit of the 1930's sorority system, but Shirley, Ellison, and Kerrigan turn it into a very enjoyable production. \n\nThen again, what do I know?

Her financially struggling father ensures this happens and with this we enter the world of the film, which takes place in a particularly non-descript campus somewhere in the Midwest.\n\nThis uber-innocent romantic comedy flows along with a very brief running time of sixty-four minutes. It deals mainly with Alice's humble interest in seeing her hopeful roommate at the boarding house garner interest of one of the local sororities, but as fate (read a fraternity member) would have it Alice is instead selected due to a technicality. Alice starts to be overcome by all of the elitism that comes from being involved with the young woman of Gamma House, and in a key scene she chooses the clique over her real family.\n\nGiven some mild female empowerment moments, it's not a surprise Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay, since a year later he'd write the script for \"Kitty Foyle\", the Ginger Rogers vehicle that can be seen as a fair attempt a work of minor pre-feminism. Here the intention seems almost to expose sororities as merely a choice for a young woman, and not the only way to pave a future, as is mentioned again and again from several characters. There does seem to be some underlying criticism of the elitism and focus on money, which makes it seem pretty edgy for its time.\n\nThe best moments were spent with Barbara Read's character, Dotty, the young woman who stands on her own two feet and laughs in the face of the sorority that turned her away. It has a certain charm and wit that makes it a nice view, but the running time and underdeveloped character make it seem little more than a trifle.

Grief in the world, Dad observes, is caused by \"cliques\" banding together, whether sororities, clubs or nations, and then coming into conflict. And though Dad doesn't say so, cliques would presumably include the bogeyman of Marxist theory, economic class. Thus, as Trumbo's mouthpiece, Dad manages to come up with a social version of a classless society, which sounds more like choosing your own friends and not letting that go to your head than anything like common ownership of the means of production. It's also in keeping with the general spirit of the times, which exalts the virtues of the common man, especially salt-of- the-earth types like dad Fisher.\n\nThe movie itself is entertaining enough for a studio programmer, managing some gritty dramatics (the pushy aunt ruining Merle's pledge chances; the suicide attempt) and, of course, the expected sappy romance. But it's really Anne Shirley who shines and holds things together. Her friendliness comes across as so natural and unforced that you can't help but root for her. She's perfect as the unspoiled small town girl. Nonetheless, the movie remains very much a product of Hollywood and its time. \n\nIn passing\u0097for a more revealing look at college sororities backed by of an A-budget, catch up with TCF's Take Care of My Little Girl (1952). In my little book, it's a real sleeper, despite the gloss.",

                "text": "Anne Shirley seemed to spend a lot of the thirties in school!! There was \"Finishing School\" (1934), \"School for Girls\" (1934), \"Girl's School\" (1938) until she finally arrived at \"Sorority House\". Anne was a sensitive actress who often put more into her parts than was there in the first place. Her two big films were \"Anne of Green Gables\" and \"Stella Dallas\" but because she had been in movies since the age of four, by her teenage years she was considered a fixture and was passed over for roles she would have been ideal for, in favour of other up and coming actresses (Maureen O'Hara in the remake of \"A Bill of Divorcement\" and Jane Bryan in \"The Old Maid\"). So, once again, Anne was back in familiar territory in \"Sorority House\" as Alice, daughter of a small town grocer who withdraws all his savings so she can attend the prestigious Talbot University.\n\nIn my opinion this was a much better movie than \"Girl's School\" and Anne had a chance to add more dimension to her characterization. Once at college dewy eyed Alice falls right in step with the social climbing fever that is gripping the school - although she still retains her country values. Any co-ed who is not a sorority girl is seen as a \"dreep\" (a combination of dreary and weep). Her two room- mates are Dottie (Barbara Read) who is philosophical about her low chances of being invited to a sorority and Merle, who is frantic to join but whose aunt with her pushy behaviour ruins her chances. Although countrified Alice would ordinarily not have a hope of getting into Gamma, the top sorority house, she makes the acquaintance of Bill (James Ellison) the college hero who takes Alice under his wing and helps her adjust to the hectic social life. To say nothing of spreading a rumor that Alice's father owns a supermarket chain - instead of his one struggling grocery store.\n\nSuddenly all the sororities are clamouring for her but with all the invitations come extra expenses, fees etc and Alice's father finds he has to sell his store to pay for all the hidden costs. When Alice's father turns up unannounced at a sorority \"Meet the Parents\" party, for one brief moment Alice turns into a social snob - ashamed of her own father. He saves the day with oodles of home spun philosophy - telling the story of Abraham Lincoln, preventing a suicide and giving Alice a lecture on freedom of choice when she decides to found a club where sorority members will not be welcolme!!\n\nBarbara Read started off as one of the \"Three Smart Girls\" that made a star out of Deanna Durbin but she really looked too much like Durbin and was replaced in the sequel \"Three Smart Girls Grow Up\" by Helen Parrish. Veronica Lake and Marge Champion can be glimpsed as co-eds.",

He's the campus hero who helps her learn the ins and outs of campus life. Anne Shirley made this film the same year that she tested for Melanie in GWTW and her sweetness appears natural here.

Gene's in it, but his part is overshadowed by an over-emoting Jane Withers whose boisterous personality is, I think, a matter of taste. Then too, you may need a score card to keep up with the meandering plot that mixes a family feud with a town's survival with a love triangle with a movie shoot, and finally with real bank robbers. If this sounds complicated, it is, but despite the mix, the results are still pretty entertaining. The opening Autry-Withers duet \"Wanderers\" is delightful. Too bad we don't see more of Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon's Ming the Merciless) whose graveyard voice and Grim Reaper looks always made me cover my little-kid eyes back in matin\u00e9e days.\n\nThis was a big studio production, Twentieth-Century Fox, which probably accounts for the odd mix, especially a cast that includes familiar Western types like Tom London and Eddie Acuff, but also city dudes like Jack Carson and Robert Lowery. For viewers interested in seeing how horse operas were filmed, this is an opportunity. Carson plays a fast-talking movie producer come to town to shoot an oater based on the town's most famous cowboy citizen. The behind-the-scenes look is fascinating and I'm sure the crew got a kick out of filming \"a movie within a movie\". But there's not much hard riding or fast shooting, so for fans of more conventional B-Westerns, this one may be a \"skip it\".",

Having been loaned out to Fox goes a long way to explain how Jane Withers got top billing here even though most viewers would probably consider it an Autry flick. However when you get right down to it, Withers got most of the screen time and her high energy performance as young Jane Pritchard overshadowed just about everyone else in the cast, including Gene.\n\nThere's another thing about Withers' character, she was probably the most level headed person in Carson Corners, always trying to find a way to patch things up between the Pritchard's and the Carson's, a long running feud that began in the days of Will Carson's (Autry) granddad, Wild Bill Carson. When Signet Pictures arrives in town looking to produce a film about the town's namesake, Jane finds herself an intermediary to a whole host of competing forces, with her main goal of getting sister Margy (Marjorie Weaver) finally married to Will Carson.\n\nSince this wasn't a Republic film Gene doesn't have any of his usual sidekicks around for comedy relief like Smiley Burnette, or other regulars like Gail Davis or Mary Lee. But the folks at Fox Studios allowed for a fair number of tunes like 'Wanderers of the Wasteland', 'Little Shanty of Dreams', 'Only One Love in a Lifetime' and 'This Little Old Band of Gold'. The romance angle between Margy and Will plays out successfully following a real bank holdup that replaces the movie script, and young Jane couldn't be happier.\n\nRepublic must have liked the idea of involving Gene in a film utilizing a movie studio angle because they came up with a couple themselves. There was 1941's \"Down Mexico Way\" and \"Sioux City Sue\" in 1946. Probably the biggest surprise for me coming out of the picture was when I looked up Jane Withers' other credits. I knew she looked somewhat familiar but you could have knocked me over with a feather with this one - if you were around in the mid-Sixties and watching nightly TV, you probably saw her just about every night pitching Comet Cleanser as Josephine the Plumber! As I write this she's still alive and will be ninety years old in a couple of weeks - God bless her.",

But the problem is that Gene's a Carson and Weaver and Withers are Pritchards. The Carsons and the Pritchards have been feuding for generations and that fact keeps the two lovers apart.\n\nGene's grandfather was a fighting lawman of the old west and a film company comes to town wanting to film a story about Grandpa. It will star Robert Lowery and Kay Aldridge and will bring a short wave of prosperity to the area.\n\nIt won't do me any good to continue, but things do work for the young people in the end as they inevitably do. \n\nThings do get a bit silly here. Autry does well simply being Gene Autry at another studio. Withers plays a Miss Fix-It in a way to rival Deanna Durbin without singing a note. Jack Carson as the fast talking studio agent really stands out in the film.

                "text": "With the runaway success of the re-issue on a double bill of both \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" in the late nineteen thirties, Universal Studios decided it was time to resurrect their most lucrative property, the Frankenstein Monster, if the studio was to have any chance of surviving the fiscal year. True to form they originally intended to produce nothing more than a quick cheapie to cash in on the public's renewed interest in horror films. Director Rowland V. Lee had other ideas. He envisioned the film as a modern fairy tale with Frankenstein's Monster as the traditional giant ogre stalking a primordial landscape, and to be sure it is in this film that he first enters the realm of myth. To help achieve this goal he set Jack Otterson to create the most expressionistic sets of any horror film since \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". The universe of \"Son\" is a world of perpetual night and fog; rain swept castles and blasted heaths; terrifying flashes of lightening; shadowy corridors where giants lurk; hidden passage ways leading to underground crypts, where time, dust and the worm aren't the only things that move among the dead. \"Son of Frankenstein\" is the most visually impressive of all of Universal's horror films and George Robinson's gorgeous black and white cinematography captures every shadow, every out-sized distortion beautifully.\n\nThis would also be the last time a Frankenstein film would have a script worthy of the subject. Willis Cooper fashioned a contemporary Grimm's fairy tale in which the journey of the film's \"outsiders\", Wolf, Elsa, and Peter will become progressively more nightmarish the deeper they descend; where even breakfast in the morning will be overseen by a pair of monstrous gargoyles. They're journeying by train to inherit the Frankenstein estate, unknown to them a house literally at the edge of Hell, and these opening shots are the most \"normal\" in the entire film. They think of themselves as \"explorers\" and \"exploring something so foreign we can't even imagine what its like.\" They speak of the castle being \"haunted\", while outside the window we see through the wind and the rain a gray expanse of desolation and dead trees. \"What a strange country!\" Elsa exclaims. Their passage into the subterranean netherworld of mad doctors, murderous hunchbacks and monsters has begun and will climax in a necrophilic family reunion, (\"We're all dead here.\") in the Frankenstein crypt, in which both grandfather and father are dead, but the step-brother, the monster and family black sheep is very much alive. \"Do you mean to imply that is my brother?\" Wolf asks. Igor, the true Frankenstein family retainer replies, \"Only his mother was the lightening.\" And it is Wolf's voyage from arrogance and ignorance, (\"Why should we fear anything!\") to humility and wisdom, (\"Never in my life have I known cold fear until that moment I felt his hand on my shoulder!\") which is central to the film.\n\nWhile the film is a follow up to \"Bride of Frankenstein\", it very much stands on its own. Gone are any references to the Bride and Dr, Praetorious, both presumably \"blown to atoms\" at the climax of that film. Also the monster doesn't speak. All traces of speech, at Karloff's insistence were eliminated. The portrait of Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein dominates the castle's study, and recalls the earlier films. In the scenes on the train Wolf refers to the, \"Blunder of a stupid assistant who gave his father's creation the brain of a killer instead of a normal one.\" This is of course, a direct reference to the first film. Karloff's return to his greatest role completes the linking of the three films. And consistent with the impressive visuals, the Monster is given his most striking look. Gone is the distinctly twentieth century black garb so beloved of the Universal Frankenstein films. Instead the Monster is clothed in a crude sheepskin jersey, with heavy shirt and trousers stitched together with strips of leather. Indeed, his whole appearance has become that of a giant, an ogre out of Grimm or Perrault. He even gets the traditional giant's club in the form of Krogh's wooden arm at the film's climax. As if to underscore this, Peter gives the Monster a present-a storybook of fairy tales!\n\nThe film may have the greatest horror film cast ever. There is Karloff dominating as the Monster. Given less screen time than in the previous film, his scenes are still among his most powerful. To cite just two examples, the scene where he rises like Lucifer out of the pit is like an image from Dante's Inferno while his primal howl of grief upon discovering the dead Igor is one of the Monster's greatest moments from any of the Frankenstein films. Bela Lugosi easily has his best role after Dracula as the broken neck, hunchback, Igor. Creepy, roguish, even pitiable, one is reminded of what a fine actor he could be with a role worthy of his talent. Lionel Atwill with his beautifully clipped vocal delivery and sardonic sense of humor has his definitive screen role as the one arm Inspector Krogh; he doesn't miss any opportunity for scene stealing bits of business with that wooden arm. And there is Basil Rathbone as Wolf. He doesn't have Karloff's make-up or Lugosi's broken neck or Atwill's wooden arm, but he gives a full-blooded commanding performance that refuses to get lost in this who's who of cinematic ghouls. William K. Everson once said that only a truly great actor can get away with a little deliberate ham now and then, and if Rathbone is a little over the top, it is ham well seasoned and served and adds enormously to the enjoyment of the film. Finally Frank Skinner's incredible film score would set the standard for Universal's horror films for the next decade.",

                "text": "Usually the third film in a series shows signs of decline either in quality or inventiveness. Even the third 'Godfather' was significantly less than its predecessors. Universal's 'Frankenstein' series that began in the early 1930's was no exception and showed some wear by the end of the decade when 'Son of Frankenstein' was released. Under the sensitive direction of James Whale, the original 'Frankenstein' was a classic, and, in the first sequel, 'Bride of Frankenstein,' Whale even managed to better it. However, while Whale was not involved with 'Son,' the third installment turned out to be a surprisingly good movie even if it failed to match the two preceding films. Perhaps the major reason for the success of 'Son' was the casting of Basil Rathbone as Wolf Frankenstein, the original Baron's son. Rathbone is a fine strong actor, and his characterization certainly exceeds Colin Clive's somewhat colorless portrayal of his father in the preceding films. Rathbone holds the viewer's attention throughout as he becomes immersed in the legacy of his father and fails to comprehend the consequences of what he is doing. Boris Karloff returns for a third time as the monster. Although he does a fine job, there is less opportunity for the actor to show the range of emotion in this film that he displayed in 'Bride.' Another aspect of 'Son' that raises it above the ordinary is the set and lighting design, which owes a debt to German expressionism. The sets have bold diagonals in their construction, and the cameraman has lit them to cast equally bold shadows against bare walls and create abstract patterns that often recall 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.' The lighting and design of one particular section of a cave under the Frankenstein laboratory could have been blown up and framed as an expressionist photograph. Although it does not reach the heights of the Whale films, 'Son of Frankenstein' is a worthy successor and an engrossing film in its own right.",

                "text": "Series note: I strongly recommend that you watch the Frankenstein films to this point in order. Each builds on the events of the previous entry and will have much more meaning and significance if watched in order. The first film is Frankenstein (1931), and the second is Bride of Frankenstein (1935).\n\nThe third film in Universal's Frankenstein series, Son of Frankenstein is set after the first two film's Henry Frankenstein has passed away. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), Henry's son, is on his way to claim his inheritance from his father, and receives a not-too-warm welcome from the small German town that has been frightened out of its wits by Henry's doings with monsters. While staying at the family castle, Wolf opens a box containing his father's research records and a note from his father encouraging him to follow in the same footsteps. He initially believes he's not worthy of such encouragement, but becoming a \"mad doctor\" may be easier than he thinks.\n\nIn both the overall tone of the film and in the tone of Boris Karloff's last turn as \"The Monster\", Son of Frankenstein is much more closely allied with James Whale's first Frankenstein film, rather than the camp-fest that was Bride of Frankenstein. New series director Rowland V. Lee has everything played various seriously, even Bela Lugosi's Ygor, which could have easily become funny, intentionally so or not.\n\nAdding to the atmosphere are the sets, which are just as grand in their own way as anything in either of Whale's two Frankenstein films. This time around the expressionist influence is at its strongest, but it is combined with a prescient minimalism. While the first two films had strong surrealist visual touches combined with their expressionism, Son of Frankenstein dispenses altogether with any concerns of approaching realism or naturalism. The idea here instead is to create starkness and shadows, often with a maximum of intentional artificiality. It's an appropriate approach that both pays homage to the earlier films and reflects the plot of the present film--shadows are an offspring of their parent objects, and the monster is an artificial man. The production and set design of the film is even more remarkable when one realizes that art directors of the era routinely worked on many films at once. Son of Frankenstein's Art Director Jack Otterson, for example, worked on over 50 films in 1942 alone! \n\nIt's a rare treat to have three genre icons the caliber of Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi together in one film. They mesh exquisitely, managing to enhance each other's performances with no one upstaging anyone else. Lionel Atwill, as Inspector Krogh, easily holds his own with the trio (although any fan of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein (1974) is sure to laugh at occasional moments involving Krogh, since he is so perfectly spoofed in Brooks' film), as does the beautiful Josephine Hutchinson as Frankenstein's wife Elsa (named after the woman who played The Bride in the previous film, Elsa Lanchester) and Donnie Dunagan as their son Peter.\n\nLugosi's Ygor was supposedly improvised then written into the film--Lugosi was originally slated to play a policeman. This is remarkable in that his shepherd character and relationship to The Monster are so well integrated. The Monster symbolically wears a heavy woolen vest/smock, and has a deeply symbiotic relationship with Ygor that is the core of the film. Ygor is also \"undead\" in his own way.\n\nWhile Son of Frankenstein is not nearly as epic as the first two films, it should not be. Its aim is to unfold more like a stage play, with highly abstract, symbolic sets and finely integrated performances from a skilled cast. As such, it is every bit as good as the first two films in the series.",

Best of all is Karloff--he uses pantomime throughout the whole picture (even though in the previous \"Bride of...\" he had learned to speak) and gets every meaning across.

As the events unfold, the story shifts from the torment of the creator, Frankenstein, to the torment of the creation, the Monster.\n\nNow in 'Son of...', the emphasis is shifted back to the scientist. And Karloff no longer has a monopoly on the role of the 'Back From the Dead'; he shares that with Lugosi's 'Ygor'. Nor does he have the monopoly on the 'Artificial Human'; he shares that spot with Atwill's one-armed 'Inspector Krogh'. Nor does he possess his personality that was gradually evolving in the first two entries. The Monster has been reduced to a hulking henchman bound to the will of the evil Ygor. \n\nThe 'Monster turned pawn' had actually begun in 'Bride of...' as Pretorious used him to force Frankenstein to create the Monster's mate. You could almost say that the Monster was used as a tool for Henry Frankenstein to play God; a tool for Pretorious' dream to create a new race; and a tool for Ygor's desire for revenge on the jurors who condemned him to the hangman's noose. The difference in 'Son of...' is that the Monster no longer evolves and the character is left with no where to go.\n\nBut this is still a fascinating film. Director Lee replaces realistic sets and background with surrealism. Details from the first two films are abandoned for light background and twisted, gargantuan shadows. And much of some great action set-pieces have already occurred off screen, before the movie begins. Which means we're left with alot of talk of 'what was' and 'what happened before'. Which kind of fits into the definition of what a legend constitutes. Fortunately, the actors doing the talking are Rathbone, Lugosi and Atwill. Even Rathbone's over the top performance can be forgiven, knowing his next film(?) was his signature (& debut) role as Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound of the Baskervilles', a role he was absolutely brilliant in.\n\nEven though Karloff has a much reduced role, the gigantic sets, dead trees and slanted architecture compels the viewer to be constantly aware of his lurking menace. It is this approach that, standing on its own, makes this a fine film. The viewer is forced to rely on imagination more than the first two movies put together. It is certainly a more polished film than the original. And Lugosi and Atwill's support acting are leagues above the wooden Mae Clarke, John Boles and Valerie Hobson. \n\nLike the Monster; \"tis better to have been made, than never to have been made at all\". We would have missed out on all that fun.\n\n7 out of 10 !  One of my favorite 'Frankenstein' films.",

Unfortunately, the monster's makeup photographed a pale green and they went back to the old reliable black and white. With all the hoopla and first rate cast, this film comes up short of the first two in the series.\n\n The story picks up some years after the first two. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), the son of Henry, his wife Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and young son Peter (Donnie Dunagon) return to the family castle. The village resents him having not forgotten the carnage created by his father's creation.

Ygor explains that \"He is my friend...he does things for me\". We then learn that several prominent villagers have been mysteriously murdered and that the killer remains at large. Frankenstein gets his creative juices flowing and agrees to restore the monster to his full potential.\n\n Unknown to Frankenstein, the monster has been in contact with his son and has been moving about.

Here, he is given little to do except to be Ygor's henchman. He no longer talks and invokes no pathos whatsoever. Rathbone is way over the top as usual, as the Baron. Lugosi, in his best part in years, steals the film. He is the real villain of the piece. Given the time of the film, Lionel Atwill's character seems to be a lampoon of a German officer.

The Great Basil Rathbone now played Baron Henry Frankenstein's son who would journey to his homeland to claim his inheritance.Rathbone is Baron Wolf von Frankenstein and his wife is Baroness Elsa von Frankenstein(Josephine Hutchinson) who have a little boy.Rowland V.

The old watchtower is now on the Frankenstein estate where Rathbone's character goes and explores one morning.It is inside this old structure that he meets Bela Lugosi's greatest role of all time:the evil Ygor.A shaggy Lugosi with a moustache,beard, having a broken neck and speaking with a gravelly voice in broken English leads Rathbone to a secret crypt in the old watchtower where Baron Wolf von Frankenstein sees where his Father-Baron Heinrich von Frankenstein(better known as Henry) and his Grandfather are now buried. As Wolf and Ygor walk farther into this crypt he discovers the Frankenstein Monster(Boris Karloff) in a comatose state.In this scene,the Monster flinches as Rathbone's Baron von Frankenstein screams out in shock,\"He's Alive!\" ...proving he has the same great Frankenstein blood flowing through his veins as that of Colin Clive. This film is this writer's favorite of the Karloff and Lugosi films with Basil Rathbone and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh giving excellent performances as well.

Lionel Atwill is excellent as Inspector Krogh who had his arm pulled off by the Monster as a child and makes a point with it in numerous scenes throughout this movie. But Karloff and Lugosi work excellently together seeming to be the absolute closest of friends as Monster and the evil Ygor.Boris Karloff left this series on truly a high note . Son Of Frankenstein is one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nThe Great Boris Karloff would return to the Universal series one last time in 1944 in House Of Frankenstein to play the mad scientist Dr.Gustav Niemann...and he makes the most of this evil character too.",

                "text": "\"Son of Frankenstein\" (Universal, 1939), directed by Rowland V. Lee, marked a new beginning to the second cycle of Universal horror: a lavish, stylish, stagy production as well as the longest (94 minutes) movie in the FRANKENSTEIN series. Boris Karloff returns for the third and final time as The Monster, but unfortunately, after such a grand performance in \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), in which Karloff got star billing, The Monster in this production is of secondary importance, coming late into the story and spending more than half the film lying in an unconscious state on an operating table inside the lab. Star billing goes to Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein, the son of the scientist who brought nothing but misery in the German town, but the scene stealer in this production happens to be Bela Lugosi, almost unrecognizable as the bearded character of Ygor, possibly his best performance in his latter day career. It features Lugosi in a performance unlike anything he has done thus far, and he virtually helps the story along especially during its numerous slow spots. This also marked his fourth teaming opposite Karloff, but this time, Lugosi outshines Karloff's performance. Then there is Lionel Atwill, another horror film veteran, making his debut in the series, playing a one armed police inspector, another interesting presence to the story.\n\nThe story, set in a Gothic German village, finds Wolf Von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone) returning by train to the town where his parents once lived. He is accompanied by his charming wife, Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson), and their little boy, Peter (Donnie Donegan). Wolf hopes to make amends to the villagers from what his late father had done (creating a Monster who terrorized their village years ago) and become their good neighbors, but with the Frankenstein name, the family is cursed, and nobody wants anything to do with them. The Frankensteins are first met by Inspector Krough (Atwill), a police official with an artificial arm, claiming to have lost his real arm when he was a young boy when the Monster ripped from his body by the roots, but in spite of all this, Krough is on duty to aide the Frankensteins in case trouble amongst the villagers prevails. Also in the castle where the Frankensteins are staying are Aunt Amelia (Emma Dunn), and Thomas Benson, the butler (Edgar Norton).\n\nWhile the movie starts off rather slowly, it then comes to life when Wolf encounters Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a crazed bearded shepherd who was once or twice sentenced and hanged for grave robbing, and still lives. Ygor is also the master of the Monster (Karloff), who \"does things for him.\" His coma condition happens to be a result of an aftereffect of being struck by lightning, and Ygor calls on Wolf to help revive the monster.\n\n\"Son of Frankenstein\" is more of a science fiction nature than horror, since the movie spends a great deal of footage in the laboratory having Frankenstein examining his father's creation and how this physical being has survived such ordeals after finding his heart containing two bullets, etc. But after Karloff's monster is revived, he manages to present himself with some key scenes, such as looking at himself in the mirror and pulling Wolf along side him as a comparison; and the Monster's fondness of children, especially Wolf's little boy who fears him not.\n\nThe storyline, however, contradicts what had been said and done in previous movies, such as letting the Monster, who had learned to talk in \"The Bride of ...,\" resorting back to only grunts. It even fails to explain how the Monster had survived his demise from the earlier film. And what's the deal with the woolly garment he is wearing? In spite of these drastic changes, the movie itself is full of characters, ranging from Lionel Bellmore, the Burgomaster in 1931's \"Frankenstein,\" now playing Emile Lang, along with Gustav Von Seyffertitz (the villainous Grimes in the 1926 silent classic, \"Sparrows\") as one of the jurors. While Colin Clive's Frankenstein character allowed himself to become hysterical in the first two entries, viewers expect and accept this, but when Rathbone's character calls for him to do the same, especially during the dart playing sequence with Krough, this somewhat becomes embarrassing to sit through, in spite that Rathbone is a very capable actor who seldom overacts as he does here.\n\nWhile not on the same scale as James Whale's earlier carnations of the Frankenstein films, \"Son of Frankenstein\" is still watchable, mainly because of its Universal staff players, and added sound effects of thunder and lightning, as well as very moody setting made to the comforts of home for the Frankenstein family. The underscoring by Frank Skinner introduced here would be heard time and time again in other Universal horror films of the 1940s. This movie played on numerous cable channels, including the Sci-Fi Channel, American Movie Classics (1991, and again from 2000 to 2002, 2006), and finally on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered in January 2003. It can also be found as a video/DVD purchase or rental. (***)",

The Acting. Son of Frankenstein features a Who's Who of the best of the classic horror actors. Joining Rathbone and Lugosi in the cast are Boris Karloff and Lionel Atwill. While each gives a noteworthy performance in their own right, Lugosi's performance is generally held up as the best of his career. And while I agree, Rathbone makes Son of Frankenstein a joy for me to watch. There are very few actors that I can think of who could have played Wolf with the same type of intelligent energy that Rathbone exhibits. He's wonderful. As for Karloff, I'm glad he decided to make Son of Frankenstein his last as the monster. By the time of the second sequel, Karloff's monster became little more that a prop for Lugosi, Rathbone, and Atwill to fight over.\n\n2. The Sets. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the sets in Son of Frankenstein are among the best I've ever seen. The sets are amazing with their bizarre angles and shadows. Two that immediately come to mind are the dining table set and the staircase set at the beginning of the movie. They are in a class of their own.\n\nEvery fan of horror, or just good classic movies in general, owes it to themselves to see Son of Frankenstein. It may not be as well known among the casual fan as either Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein, but it many ways it's the equal of those two films (if not better).",

Along the way he meets his father's old assistant Ygor, who has a broken neck from having been hanged and living, and the creature his father created.  The townspeople get excited, a couple die, and mayhem takes over.  This movie is above-average for a number of reasons.  First and foremost it is a highly stylized movie in the German impressionistic manner.  The sets are incredible and director Rowland Lee spares little in showing us his appreciation of movies such as Nosferatu and Caligari.  The castle is a huge atmospheric temple and each room is just as big in its own way.  This is the film that inspired most of Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein both in look and plot.  The plot is good but the acting carries it beyond that.  Karloff as always does a great job in his final role as the monster.  Rathbone makes a great scientist trying to avenge his father's name.  He starts the movie very relaxed and his tension builds and builds.  His scenes with Atwill are his best.  That brings us to the two great performances of the film...Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi.  Lugosi as Ygor is perhaps his greatest role after Dracula.  His voice, his leers, his manner are all wonderfully played.  It is Lugosi that steals every scene he is in.  That is not bad because Lionel Atwill steals every scene he is in(the two have no scenes together).  Atwill brings life into his role as an inspector with a wooden arm.  Atwill has grace and charm, and a generous dose of humour.  This is his best role as far as I am concerned.  Just listening to him give his speech about his encounter with the monster as a child is at one hand chilling and at the other emotional.  Son of Frankenstein deservedly ranks as one of the great Universal horror pictures.  It is not as good as The Bride of Frankenstein, but looks better than any of the Universal horror pictures.

                "text": "Son of Frankenstein ushered in Universal's Second Golden Age of Horror. Inspired by the turnaway business generated by a double bill revival of the original Dracula and Frankenstein, the new Universal management decided to revive the monster for the third time. Once again, Karloff played the monster (for the last time in the movies) and here he was brilliantly supported by the finest horror cast ever assembled: Bela Lugosi (who for once has a decent-sized role\u0097built up by director/producer Lee\u0097which he plays with admirable intensity); Basil Rathbone (supremely jittery as the misguided baron, Rathbone plays the heir with a clipped, compelling authority that is both convincing yet sympathetic); and Lionel Atwill (probably his most memorable part as the punctilious police inspector who uses his wooden arm as a grotesque prop).\n\nAlthough the monster doesn't enter for some time, the atmospheric build-up is absolutely terrific. This is achieved not only by clever scripting, skilled acting and a tingling, eerily tense music score (entirely composed and scored in a frantic fortnight, Lionel Newman tells us, in order to meet the pre-set Hollywood premiere on 13 January 1939), but by the amazingly effective use of expressionist sets (superbly lensed by ace cinematographer George Robinson, a specialist in film noirish lighting). Often Lee cleverly keeps the sets right in the foreground, while the players are grouped at the back. \n\nNaturally, as soon as the sets started to receive widespread favorable critical comment, supervising art director Jack Otterson (who had not initially been all that enthusiastic) started to claim credit for the whole idea. Heavily influenced yet quite distinct from Caligari, these \"psychological sets\", as Jack Otterson called them, represent a remarkable arrangement of oddly angled and slanting lines intersected by heavy masses and shadows. All told, an extraordinary achievement that, although wholly successful, was never again attempted in a Hollywood movie. \n\nOn all fronts\u0097screenplay, acting, direction, cinematography, sets and atmosphere\u0097Son of Frankenstein is an absolute winner. Not only the best in the series, it's one of the all-time greats. Its only flaw\u0097and it's a small one\u0097is the occasionally too-stilted performance delivered by young Donnie Dunagan (whom Lee had used in a featured role in 1938's Mother Carey's Chickens and was to use again in a very small part in his 1939 Tower of London starring Rathbone and Karloff).",

Rathbone is as much the scientist as his old man and would dearly love to clear his family's reputation. He gets that chance when the hunchbacked Igor leads him to the monster.\n\nThe two roles that are unforgettable in Son Of Frankenstein are Bela Lugosi as Igor and Lionel Atwill as the one armed inspector Krogh. Both certainly were lampooned in Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein, but they are played straight and real here. Lugosi was a graverobber who used to unearth dead bodies for Rathbone's father to experiment on. He was hanged for it and unfortunately for all around it didn't take, just left him with a crooked shape and a thirst for revenge.\n\nAs for Atwill as a child his right arm was ripped from its socket and he makes do with what probably was a state of the art prosthetic arm for its time. He's got the biggest score of all to settle with the monster and he bides his time knowing that Rathbone's scientific curiosity will get him experimenting again in the family tradition.\n\nSon Of Frankenstein takes its place in the pantheon of the Universal horror collection.

Where as in the previous film the monster has the power of speech here his vocal communication begins and ends with grunts and groans . This clumsy - dare one say ignorant - lack of continuity would dog Universal through the rest of their FRANKENSTEIN franchise \n\nSON is a very mixed bag . One thing noticeable is that war with Germany is on the horizon and America was far less neutral than she was during the last one hence the need for Frankenstein's son to be Anglinised . It's interesting to see the native German characters being both Teutonic and suspicious of outsiders . There's also a noticeable scene where a spy can be easily bought . You can't trust these Germans , especially if they're poised to invade the rest of Europe \n\nDirector Rowland V Lee isn't really in the same class as James Whale but does bring a directorial touch to the film . The sets are expansive and impressive and he makes good use of shadow lighting which gives the movie a bleak mood . Unlike the previous two films there does seem to be a large lack of studio exteriors which might make the film more claustrophobic but also makes it appear more static too \n\nHe does have an erratic time with the cast though . Bela Lugosi is best remembered as Dracula but as Ygor he probably gives a lifetime best performance and he's the standout character of the film . Karloff is less good because the screenplay by Wyllis Cooper makes him an archetypal monster , ( Though it's interesting to see a reference that erroneously confuses the monster with the creator , a mistake that lasts to this day ) while Donnie Dunnigan as Peter is like most child actors from the period bloody irritating whilst Basil Rathbone as Baron Frankenstein over acts every time he's supposed to nervous \n\nAll in all this is a rather uneven film , more so if you've seen either of the first two films very recently . It continues the standard by the earlier FRANKENSTEIN films by blending chills and off beat humour ( \" You spat on me \" - \" No I didn't I was clearing my throat \" ) but shows flaws that become more and more apparent in later films of the franchise of poor continuity and having the monster as literally a monster .

                "text": "In the mid-30s, Universal saw a change in management and slowly moved away from the horror genre. In 1938, however, theaters in the states began showing a successful double bill of Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN which revived interest. Naturally, Universal saw this publicity opportunity and went to work on a new monster movie. The success of this movie would lead to relaunching of all three of their original monsters in the years to come after.\n\nOf those three monster series (FRANK, Dracula and MUMMY), the Frankenstein flicks seems to make the most sense in terms of continuity. Yes, there are plenty of plot points that seem to conveniently forget anything that has come before, but for the most part each movie picks up where the previous left off.\n\nThis movie is nowhere near the classic that the first two entries in the series are, probably owing to the loss of director James Whale. It's lacking the Gothic shadows and electrical mad science lab feel of the original. Gone are the whimsical humor (though maybe not a bad thing) and humanization of the monster from BRIDE. Instead, we get a less atmospheric sequel focused more on an evil new character, the son of Frankenstein slowly descending into hysteria and more violence and murder.\n\nThe best additions are the two new actors. Bela Lugosi plays Ygor for the first time here and is remarkable. I am a huge Lugosi geek (even loving his poverty row cheapies) but the majority of the time he plays the same character in different clothes. Here, we have his most fully realized character since Dracula. Ygor is an evil little man, hellbent on revenge for a botched execution. Lugosi plays the role well, even using a voice acting that almost eliminates traces of his accent. The other addition is Basil Rathbone as Wolf Von Frankenstein. He does a very admirable job of running through a range of emotion. At first humbled by guilt for the sins of his father, his discovery of the monster leads to the same fervent fever for creation of life that overtook his dad. Eventually, as he realizes the implications of his actions, he begins a descent into hysteria that only culminates in the finale of the movie as he atones for those actions.\n\nThe monster is a disappointment, though. In the first movie, we got a sense of his complicated nature, as we see the innocence as well as the monster to fear. In BRIDE, he begins to talk and really develop as a sympathetic creature. All of that is gone here. He is, essentially, a minion of Ygor, sent to do his bidding and we only briefly see glimpses of his humanity. Of course, this is Karloff's last appearance as the monster and it would continue to devolve in the following movies.\n\nThis is definitely one of the better Universal sequels and would prove to be the last time Universal sank a large budget into one of their horror offerings.

Previously, audiences were not given a reason for Henry Frankenstein's madness. This time, they learn that Wolf von Frankenstein seeks to vindicate his father's work.

                "text": "Son of Frankenstein delivers on all fronts. Sporting great sets, a classically chilling atmosphere, and a superb cast, this has become my go-to movie whenever I'm in the mood for an old fashioned monster flick. \n\nThe film differs from many of its kin because its a whooping hour and forty-some minutes long, but it is leisurely paced and not a moment of it comes off as boring. I've heard from various sources that Universal Studios cut the director a bigger budget for this movie. This really shows in the quality of the set designs. While I do believe there is nothing quite like the barbaric infamy of Colin Clive's laboratory, SoF's overly detailed, sulfur pit infested castle and lab rivals it's father.\n\nSpeaking of rivaling his father, the titles spotlight character, Wolf von Frankenstein, proves to the audience that he is not just a clone of his father. Wolf (masterfully portrayed by Basil Rathbone) stands out in my mind as one of the best performances in any Universal Horror film. Where Colin Clive's mad doctor boasts a manic and intimidating screen presence, Rathbone's portrayal comes off as warm and caring then spirals into a frantic, guilt riddled hysterical mess. Through his interactions with his wife and son and his desperate attempt to appease the townspeople you get the feeling that Wolf von Frankenstein is a caring, sweet man. Then, sure enough, the old Frankenstein obsession starts to show and when it does the film starts to go a mile a minute. While watching these movies I'm never afraid or creeped out by any means. Modern Hollywood has left me desensitized. However, I must admit that there was a part in this movie that legitimately sent a chill up my spine. I won't spoil it, but when it happens you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nOpposite of Rathbone is Lionel Atwill playing the persistent Inspector Krogh. Upon first seeing Atwill's introduction in the film, I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking \"Here comes the stereotypical, paranoid townsman ready to demonize Frankenstein.\" I could not have been more wrong. Atwill's Inspector Krogh is one of the most interesting character's I've ever encountered in an old horror film. His sympathy for Frankenstein's family and the cat and mouse game it turns into leaves you invested throughout the whole plot. The entirety of the film you are left wondering who will win, the witty, young doctor or the sharp, weathered inspector. Not to mention, Krogh has a very personal and interesting reason to fear the Monster. In many ways, I found myself regarding Krogh as the hero of the story.\n\nBut let's not fool ourselves, we don't watch these movies for the heroes. We watch them for the monsters!\n\nBoris Karlof and an unrecognizable Bela Lugosi are here in full form. This is Karlof's last appearance as the Monster and its a memorable one. His first appearance in this film is not something I'll soon forget. This is not the most aggressive you'll see the Monster, but definitely the most terrifying. This is largely due to the fact that he is being controlled by Bela Lugosi's Ygor, who sports enough cunning to use the monsters as a killing machine. Rather than going on a mindless rampage, the Monster is sent on James Bond-esque missions to assassinate Ygor's enemies. As you witness these murders happening you realize that this makes for a rather disturbing concept. \n\nLugosi's Ygor is undoubtedly the highlight of this movie. Personally, I found this to be the Hungarian actor's best performance, even outshining his legendary role as Dracula. His lines are delivered with such savagery, you can absolutely tell what kind of a life Ygor has led and what kind of ideas go through his head just from his voice alone. The makeup here is superb (though his wig is a little iffy at times) and Lugosi's dedication to Ygor's unique 'posture' makes you forget that the seductive Hungarian is beneath the beard and fake teeth.\n\nSon of Frankenstein is a must see for any horror fan. I could also see this acting as a 'gateway drug' for budding horror enthusiast. While not as classic as the original or as interesting as the sequel, Son of Frankenstein is exciting and can keep just about anyone entertained. I highly recommend it.",

He brings along his wife and young son. They are greeted coldly by the local villagers, who are suspicious of anyone bearing the Frankenstein name. Their suspicions are soon justified when Frankenstein meets Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a graverobber who has a deformed neck due to a botched hanging. Ygor takes Wolf to the comatose body of the monster (Boris Karloff) his father created and the son decides to follow in his father's footsteps by reviving the creature.\n\nThe third film in Universal's Frankenstein series and the first without James Whale. It's a terrific movie that adds a lot to the Frankenstein mythos, particularly Ygor. It doesn't get as much respect as the first two Frankenstein films but it really should. It's just as creative and influential. The plots of the Frankenstein sequels that followed would owe more to this film than its predecessors. It would also be the primary source for the Mel Brooks parody movie Young Frankenstein. Rowland V. Lee's direction is impressive and he more than proves himself worthy to follow in the footsteps of Whale. The music by Frank Skinner is wonderful. I love the Expressionistic sets. \n\nThe cast is one of the finest Universal ever assembled. Horror legends Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill both have roles here that are career highlights. Lugosi's Ygor is often touted as his best acting performance, something that is very hard to argue against. Atwill's wooden-armed Inspector Krogh is undeniably memorable and might be his finest role as well. For his part, Basil Rathbone plays the part of Wolf brilliantly but he doesn't get much respect from critics, who call him hammy. To me, he's never over the top or distracting in his performance. If he's hammy, it's with a precision that many actors could learn from. This was Boris Karloff's final turn as the monster in the Frankenstein series. While he's given less to work with than the last film, he still manages to create a sympathetic and human monster. The subsequent actors taking on the role would pretty much play the monster as a mindless, hulking creature with little personality. When it comes to actors portraying Frankenstein's monster, there's Boris Karloff and then there's everybody else far down the list. The only oddity in the cast is Donnie Dunagan, the little boy playing Frankenstein's son. He was from the (American) South so he has this noticeable accent that stands out, as well as being a pretty poor little actor. He flubs several lines. Still, for avid fans like myself there's a certain charm to his quirky casting. Perhaps it's because so many of the Universal horrors took place in a blended 19th/20th century fictional world with actors of various nationalities all playing countrymen.\n\nSon of Frankenstein serves as a perfect finish to the series. Yes, there are more sequels but those films, while very entertaining, are not on the level of the original three masterpieces. The trilogy of Frankenstein, Bride, and Son are among the finest, most creative films Universal put out, regardless of genre. There is genuine artistry on display in these three films. While the first two get an appropriate amount of respect and praise, I can't help but feel this one gets the short end of the stick. It's really a fantastic movie and one of my favorites of the entire Universal horror catalogue.",

The monster by the end of Bride was a fully formed character, we knew who he was as a character and was fully relatable. Son decides to toss that out the window and basically reboot the monster. In fact, Son actually ignores Bride almost completely, it doesn't mention anything of Dr. Pretorius, what happened to the Bride etc. I realise this takes place about 40 years after Bride because Baron is Henry Frankensteins son, and at the end of Bride he didn't have a son, but ... I don't care, you can throw all the excuses you want as to why everything makes perfect sense from Bride to Son but to me it doesn't feel as connected as it should.\n\nKarloff isn't the heavyweight he was in the original and Bride. He puts in a good performance but after Bride you expected more from the character, and because the character has reset, Karloff really can't do much with him, so I blame the writing, not Karloff himself.\n\nBut lets get into why I love this film. Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone as Ygor and Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein. Lugosi as Ygor rivals Dracula as his best performance. The weird, raspy voiced man with a broken neck completely upstages Karloff in every scene, a character that was probably as much fun to play for Lugosi as it was to watch for me. Baron is a fantastic character, having to deal with being in the dark shadows of his fathers actions he slowly becomes a nervous wreck as the film progresses leading to a great scene with Lionel Atwill while playing darts.\n\nLionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh is a blast as well, great dramatic performance as a man whose armed was ripped from its roots by the monster when he was a young boy.\n\nOverall, Son Of Frankenstein is a fantastic film. I wish they had of continued to explore the monster from Bride but instead we got given this, but if getting what I wanted means loosing Lugosi as Ygor, then I would pick Son every time.",

                "text": "From a visual presentation, \"Son of Frankenstein\" is fantastic. It features some of the best sets of the series. All the buildings in the village have weird sloping roofs. The boxes of the judge's house loom high over the floor. Grotesque stone gargoyles framed either side of the Frankenstein dining room, glaring down on the family as they eat. The cave leading into the laboratory has a hallucinatory rocky ceiling. A giant circular opening leads up into the lab, the bubbling sulfur pit casting an eerie glow over all the electronics. The architecture casts odd shadows on the wall. While the film mostly builds atmosphere with these elements, it has at least one scene of good old fashion foggy nights, a moment of the Monster wandering through the countryside. The film is well-shot. I love the Monster's reveal, which involves a slow pull back, the body on a slab before Basil Rathbone and Ygor. In another scene, the Monster is raised up on the surgical table, the soles of his boots right in the viewer's face.\n\nOften regarded as the last \"good\" Frankenstein movie, there are aspect of \"Son\" that are utterly fascinating. Ygor watching over the sleeping child, peering in through a secret window in the wall, is frankly nightmarish. The son of Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein (Here called Heinrich, first of many continuity gaffs), Wolf returns with his family to the ancestral home. He too is a man of science and is determined to reclaim his father's legacy as one of good. In a particularly effective scene, Wolf discovers a vandal has written on his father's tomb \"Maker of Monsters.\" Once he has decided to resurrect the creature, he carves \"Maker of MEN\" over the graffiti.\n\nWolf is under constant security from the villagers and his attempts to hide his obvious guilt leads to him being highly nervous throughout. In a montage, the Monster is studied from every scientific angle and we realize just how truly inhuman he is. Basil Rathbone supposedly didn't want to do the film but I actually like his performance quite a bit. His constant anxiety could be seen as a little over the top but I think it works. It adds a certainly energy to the film.\n\nThis was the last time Karloff played the Monster, fearing the character had been reduced to a mindless killing machine. His concerns were valid. As far as emotional depth goes, the creature isn't given much to work with. Mostly he lumbers about, rather stiffly, doing Ygor's work. The Monster kills without remorse and doesn't seem much interested in anything else. Even then, Karloff manages to sneak in a moment or two. He slowly sneaks up on Wolf, places a hand on his shoulder. The doctor faces the Monster, horrified, as the creature's hands slowly work around his throat. However, Karloff steps back, rubs his head, confused. The Monster is still disgusted with his reflection and the late scenes with the little boy recall the flower girl sequence from the original. Still, as a hardcore nerd committed to fan-wankery, you can justify this behavior. He's been blown up and struck by lightening. His mind is bound to be scrambled.\n\nEven from a character development angle, it can work. In the forty-some years of his existence, the Monster has had to live with almost total rejection and fear. Reacting to any other life with murderous rage shouldn't be unexpected. His anguished wails over Ygor's death are probably the closest Karloff is allowed to get to the earlier film's diversity. I can't blame Boris for dropping out after this one. And, for the record, I like the shag jacket.\n\nYgor is an odd character. He's the primary villain in the film. Up until the very end, the Monster is a moving plot device, manipulated by the madman. I love the idea of a man who survived a hanging, a permanent knot in his neck. Lugosi, growling his lines in broken English, certainly gives a very different performance then his Dracula.\n\nLionel Atwill's Inspector Krogh is another famous contribution to the Frankenstein legacy. Atwill's monologue about how he lost his arm is deeply effective. He doesn't overact with the wooden arm. Honestly, it's cool and sets up an awesome moment at the end. I personally love that the Monster has become something of a (pre)urban legend, something whispered about, more myth then actuality at this point.\n\nI honestly like \"Son of Frankenstein\" a lot. It pales helplessly compared to the first two films but, as a sequel, it follows up the themes in logical ways while providing a few cool addition of its own. \"Young Frankenstein\" owes way more to this movie then most realize.",

Wolf then becomes obsessed with bringing the monster back to full life, thus to prove his father had the right intention but not the execution of his ideas.\n\nIt's a ripper of a sequel is this, perhaps lacking in the humour that James Whale brought to the first two films, it is however a well constructed feature boasting great performances from Rathbone {the part was originally planned for Peter Lorre}, Lionel Atwill {having a riot with his false arm} and Lugosi {possibly a career high in terms of substance}. Lee stamps his own marker on the piece and I think the nicest thing one can say is that his film sits well with Whale's classics. The only let down is actually Karloff's monster, stripped of voice at Karloff's insistence, the monster is now reduced to being a lumbering robot. It's not a fitting farewell to the great work that Karloff did with this brilliant creation. 8/10",

                "text": "Frankenstein film number 3 for Universal, major changes were afoot with SON OF FRANKENSTEIN. The most significant difference is the departure of James Whale from the series; Rowland V. Lee takes over with confidence and competence, but alas he is not nearly as inspired as Whales. Fortunately, he is a good mimic of Whale's style, and the film retains many of the trademarks of the first two Frankenstein films; great, Gothic, expressionistic sets and a total absence of sunlight... gloomy and foggy are as good as the weather gets in the town of Frankenstein, and that's in between violent thunderstorms... these are stylistically consistent with FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935), and, in fact, Lee often brings these elements to new heights. He also carries over some of the humor of BRIDE, especially if one believes the character of the Inspector with his famous artificial arm, and Wolf von Frankenstein himself, with his clumsy attempts to cover up the nature of his experiments, are intentionally funny characters (I'm not sure they are!). Another huge difference in this third picture is the absence of Colin Clive (who had unfortunately passed away prior to this picture). Basil Rathbone as the title character gets a little over the top as the film progresses, and I found his acting to actually be one of the film's few liabilities (along with some minor revisionist continuity with the first two films). But this is more than compensated for by the outstanding performances of Bela Lugosi as Ygor (in my opinion his finest performance), and Karloff, in his last performance as the Monster. Karloff actually has less to do in this film than in the previous two and for the most part isn't given much room to show off his acting chops, but he comes through with a vengeance in the scene where he discovers his only friend, Ygor, has been killed. His performance in this scene is heartbreaking, and the pinnacle of his involvement in the Frankesntein franchise. This film doesn't quite match the first two films in the series, and the happy ending seems kind of abrupt and out of place, but there is some genuine excitement during the climax of the film, some creepy atmospherics leading up to it, and definitive performances from the two greatest actors in the illustrious history of classic Universal horror.",

                "text": "How great was today, the American Movie Channel offered back to back showings of \"Frankenstein\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and \"Son of Frankenstein\" as part of it's ten day Halloween fest. For the latter two films, it was my first opportunity ever to view both, and it made for a wonderfully entertaining day. Basil Rathbone appears as the titled \"Son\" of Dr. Henry Frankenstein, the Colin Clive role in the first two films. In perhaps an odd coincidence, reference is made in the story to Scotland Yard relative to six murders; in his very next film, \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", Rathbone would begin a hugely successful run as detective Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThere are a number of departures from the earlier movies, the main one being Boris Karloff's entirely differentiated attire from the 'classic' look of the Frankenstein monster. Here he's wearing an out of character (at least for me) sheepskin type vest, reduced to the guttural grunting of the first film, whereas he was learning to speak in the interim film \"Bride\". While Dr. Henry Frankenstein's assistants in the first two movies were named Fritz and Karl (both portrayed by Dwight Frye), this is the one in which we're introduced to the familiar 'Ygor' sidekick, masterfully played by Bela Lugosi.\n\nNow if the appearance of Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi weren't enough, this film adds Lionel Atwill in a role that's almost a caricature, that of police Inspector Krogh. Perhaps I've been contaminated by the Kenneth Mars role in \"Young Frankenstein\", but if I had never seen this film, I would have believed Mel Brooks made up the whole dart scene in his screen send up. Instead, when Krogh rams all those darts into his wooden arm, I could no longer contain myself.\n\nIn fact, more than any other Frankenstein film in the series, this one probably provides the most fodder for director Brooks in his hilarious offering. How about Elsa von Frankenstein's reply to 'that awful knocker\"? And didn't Gene Wilder bear just a little more resemblance to Rathbone's character than can be explained by mere coincidence? And when you get right down to it, those arm gyrations of the Inspector made it almost seem like \"Son\" was a parody of \"Young Frankenstein\" and not vice versa.\n\nGetting back to the matter at hand, it did seem to me though that the film got more and more camp as it progressed. By the time Baron Wolf is confronted by Krogh near the end of the film, he's (Wolf) just about over the top with his explanation of Ygor's demise - \"He tried to murder me with his hammer, so I shot him\". Besides that, he seemed pretty deadly with the darts, it looked like he hit the bulls eye more than once.\n\nIf you have the chance, try to view the Frankenstein films in order of release, as each sequel builds on the events of the prior movie. If that's not possible, no problem, as each movie stands on it's own legs pretty successfully as well. As an added bonus, throw in \"Young Frankenstein\" as the cherry topping onto the mix, it will only add to your appreciation of all three.",

                "text": "The third in Universal's original Frankenstein trilogy begins with Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone in a part said to have been passed over by Peter Lorre) arriving with his wife (Josephine Hutchinson) and son Peter (Donnie Dunagan) in the village of Frankenstein to claim his late father's heritage. He meets a dark and gloomy reception from the bitter villagers residing there who recall only too well the horrors committed by Frankenstein's monstrous creation. When scientific equipment gets delivered to Wolf's castle, Police Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) pays a visit to the Frankensteins and informs Wolf that he is ready and willing to aid them if the concerned citizens should get out of hand. Krogh himself can relate to their apprehension, having lost his right arm to the monster years ago as a child when the fearsome creature tore it out by the roots. Wolf assures the Inspector that he is not involved in any type of bizarre experiments or monster-making.\n\nExploring the charred remains of the lab the next morning, Wolf encounters a sly old blacksmith named Ygor (Bela Lugosi) hiding out there. Ygor was once convicted and hanged for body snatching, yet somehow managed to survive with a broken neck and a twisted body. He shocks Wolf by leading him to a hidden cellar where the comatose body of his \"friend,\" Frankenstein's Monster (Boris Karloff), lies still, awaiting a cure. Ygor sparks Wolf's curiosity and the doctor wastes no time in charging up his electrical machinery to restore the monster and possibly clear his father's good name as well. But the sinister Ygor has plans of his own and begins to use the revitalized monster for his own personal agenda.\n\nSON OF FRANKENSTEIN was the first in the cycle of \"new\" horror releases to emerge after a mid-1930s ban on fright films was lifted. It remains the last of the \"great\" early Frankenstein pictures, owing to wonderfully bizarre and shadowy set pieces, a rousing Frank Skinner musical score, and a great cast of actors. Basil Rathbone has been both despised and applauded (I choose the latter) for his mounting, over-the-top theatrics as Wolf, who undergoes a nervous breakdown as his paranoia escalates. His battle of wits with the excellent Lionel Atwill in a masterful performance as Inspector Krogh make for highly entertaining filmgoing. Boris Karloff as the monster is imposing enough (and even sports a welcome slight change of attire) but the actor could sense the downward direction his creature was heading in, and so he gave up the part after this film. Though Boris shines in some fleeting emotional moments, it's clear that the character was taking a back seat to other shenanigans on screen, here being used as merely Ygor's pawn. Indeed, as portrayed by Bela Lugosi, his devilish Ygor is the highlight of the movie and practically steals the show. His performance is so great that it (arguably) surpasses Dracula as the best role he ever played.\n\nThis has all the classic ingredients of a great old monster film, but it just narrowly misses the mark of being note- perfect, mostly due to a sinking middle and perhaps slight overlength (it's the longest film in the saga at nearly 100 minutes). It's interesting to add that the film was originally scheduled to be shot in color, but reportedly Karloff's makeup didn't photograph that well. Fortunately, Boris' daughter Sara has presented color home movies featuring a minute or so of her father in full monster costume on the set of SON, and they have been seen every now and then on various documentaries over the years. ***1/2 out of ****",

Director Roland V. Lee doesn't have James Whale's flair or subversive sense of humor. Nor does this film reflect the same style of the earlier films, as is evident even in the sets. The sets, while interesting, are more modern and streamlined than the Gothic ones used in the first two films. The lighting and cinematography, while more than adequate, isn't as interesting as the expressionism of the earlier films. More importantly, however, the monster loses most of his personality. Boris Karloff managed to breath life into the creature in the first two films, inspiring both menace and sympathy, but becomes little more than a menacing hulk. His friendship with the boy Peter is both obvious and perfunctory. It was a pity the writer rendered the monster mute this time out. His voice gave him perspective and personality. This film marks the end of the monster as an interesting character. After this the monster simply becomes a menacing pawn in the hands of various unscrupulous characters. Still, this film remains entertaining. Bela Lugosi is a welcome addition to the series as Ygor. He gives one of his best performances in this film. Basil Rathbone also does a great job as Wolfgang Frankenstein, and Lional Atwill is excellent as Inspector Krogh.

Lee into a wonderful piece of art, that surely deserves the same status as the previous installments of the series.\n\nRowland V. Lee takes a weak script and gives it flesh and form with wonderful set design that definitely pay homage to the expressionist German movement that inspired Universal horror movies since their beginning.\n\nBoris Karloff repeats the role of the monster and a brilliant addition to the cast is the inclusion of legendary actor Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein, the son of Henry Frankenstein who returns to home only to find his father's creation. Also, Bela Lugosi plays Ygor, a deformed man who befriends the monster, but also uses him to his evil purposes.\n\nThe creature has lost the ability to speak, due to the damage he suffered in \"Bride\", so Karloff relies again in mimic to show emotions in a super way. Of great significance are his scenes with Wolf's son, and the allegory of the creature as a fairy tale ogre is very well handled.\n\nRathbone shows his range as his character goes from innocent tourist to demented scientist as Ygor forces him to help the monster.

Maybe Universal felt the monster had become too human in the previous installment & wanted to (re)establish him as the undying menace, with comments right at the start of the film describing him as a \"senseless, murderous monster\" and the later examination scenes where Wolf von Frankenstein explains to his assistants & the viewers that there isn't one part of his father's creation that's human. And we get a preview at what the monster's role in the later films would be reduced too, as he spends most of his time lying on his back here.\n\nStill, Karloff, when given the chance, is able to display some of the emotion that made the monster a very complex character in previous films, like that scene where he meets Wolf Frankenstein face to face & compares reflections. And he retains his fondness for children, yet Rowland V. Lee never shows any of these \"tender\" moments between the monster & Peter on camera, but does give us the on-screen visual of the monster contemplating throwing the boy into a boiling sulphur pit (?!).\n\nDespite my criticisms of the monster's role, there's also much in this sequel to praise, starting with the man (who in spite of his third billing) is the real star of the film, \"Bela Lugosi\" as the sly & cunning Ygor who manipulates the young Baron into reviving the monster so he can continue his revenge against the eight jurors who sent him to the gallows. Watching Lugosi here, I can't help but wonder why in the hell did Hollywood waste him so?!? \n\nBasil Rathbone does a fine job with his leading role as the somewhat naive Baron whose good intentions to clear his father's name go all wrong & doing a bit of his own scene-stealing is Lionel Atwill, who became a regular staple of the Frankenstein movies. \n\nOverall, 'Son of Frankenstein' is a very good sequel, but it also lays the groundwork for the damage that would be done to the monster some years later.",

Director Rowland V. Lee takes us back to the stylish sets of German Expressionism, yet he terrifically blends it all with the familiar and chilling story lines of Whale's originals. \"Son of Frankenstein\" unites no less than FOUR legendary horror names in its cast and two of them \u0096 Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi \u0096 give away their finest performances ever. Several decades after the initial tragedies that hit the little European town, Baron Frankenstein's son Wolf returns to the cursed place with his wife and five year old son. Supposedly just to claim his inheritance, but Frankenstein junior rapidly becomes obsessed with his father's misunderstood work and decides to stay, very much against the will of the townsfolk. When visiting the old laboratory, he discovers that that his father's former assistant Ygor still guards the monsters inside a hidden crypt and even agrees to revive it once again using his father's notes. Wolf is unaware, however, that the malicious Ygor is only interested in the monster's inhuman strength and abuses him to kill the eight jury members that sentenced him to death for snatching corpses. This sequel is reminiscent to the other two films, yet at the same time an entirely different accomplishment. Frankenstein's persona is more or less the same, namely a gifted researcher who has a bit of trouble distinguishing moral from science, but Karloff's monster is portrayed entirely different all of a sudden. There were he still had human characteristics and emotions in the other two films, he merely is a dangerous killing attribute here, operated by the truly malicious and mad raving Ygor. Perhaps the abrupt change in themes and the genius transition of evil to the formerly supportive character of Ygor is the best thing that could have happened to an overly known series as Frankenstein. As stated before, the sets are breathtaking and bringing back the fond memories of such German milestones as \"Der Januskoph\" and \"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari\". Every interior filming location, whether it's the Frankenstein mansion, the deserted laboratory or the town's courtroom, is like a magical labyrinth of secret passageways and gloomy shadows and the tense atmosphere these bizarre constructions create is superb. And even when you aren't admiring the sets & scenery for a minute, there are still multiple strong moments to experience, like Constable Krogh's (Atwill) tremendously chilling story of how he ended up as a simple small town police man with an artificial arm. Or the interrogation of Ygor by a suspicious town's council regarding the several unsolved murders! Especially remarkable is that these exact same two characters also provide the film with brilliant flashes of comedy! Krogh's fake and difficult to operate arm provide some genuine laughs (never play darts with someone who has a wooden arm!) and you haven't lived until you see Ygor spit at a jury of prominent citizens. Boris Karloff is indeed sadly underused in this installment, but his presence is naturally required, if only just to complete one of the most staggering ensemble casts in cinema ever. The first scene where Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi are standing around the table where Boris Karloff's body is lying has now become one of my most fond & treasured horror memories. \"Son of Frankenstein\" is a great classic horror achievement in its own right; highly recommended to all the real film-lovers.",

Basil Rathbone adds on much authority to the morally torn son of the original Dr. Frankenstein, with Josephine Hutchinson equally as disgusted as her unseen mother-in-law Elizabeth over Rathbone's obsession with his father's work. The film really makes an effort, not to outdo the original in horrors, but expand on the story and even give hints of dangers with the European political atmosphere of the late 1930's.

Film and sound had undergone tremendous improvements in those 8 years...keep in mind that 1939 was the crowning glory of the all in-color \"Gone With The Wind\". This film was to be made in color, as well, but apparently they just couldn't get the color of the monster's face reasonable.\n\nWe aren't told how many years have transpired since the monster was created and destroyed (or was it?), but you do see a car in this film, and the inspector Lionel Atwill) -- whose arm was torn off by the monster when he (the inspector) was a boy appears to be around 50 years old. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone) -- the son of the creator of the monster -- takes his wife (the marvelous Josephine Hutchinson) and young son (Donnie Dunagan) back to the village where it all began to claim his inheritance. Unfortunately, Rathbone decides to also redeem his father's reputation. But, the villagers still hate everything to do with Frankenstein.\n\nOne day, Rathbone stumbles upon Ygor (B\u00e9la Lugosi), a crazy old blacksmith who survived being hung for grave-robbing...deformed neck and all. They then find the monster -- in a coma -- in a crypt. Rathbone decides to revive the monster to vindicate his father. The monster seems to have an affection for Ygor, and murders at his command -- all jurors at Ygor's trial. In a fight between Rathbone and Ygor, Ygor is shot and the monster decides to kidnap Rahtbone's son as revenge. But, a more gentle side of the monster prevails and he does not harm the child. Cleverly, the monster is cornered, and in the battle, it tears out the inspector's false arm. Rahtbone manages to save his son by knocking the monster into a boiling sulfur pit.\n\nAs the film closes, the villagers cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. Is this the end of Ricco...I mean Frankenstein? Of course not, but that is for future sequels! Make no mistake, this film focuses on Basil Rathbone, and he definitely brings some class to the story line, although his acting is a little over the top when things begin going wrong late in the film. But, it's rather nice seeing him in a role where he is -- for the most part -- the good guy. As far as Boris Karloff goes, he does nothing but lie there comatose for the first half of the film, and then -- finally -- he rolls one eyeball. He does no real \"acting\" (as it were) until a full hour into the 1 hour and 39 minute film. It is no wonder that he chose to make this his last appearance as the movie monster for many years. Bela Lagosi is bearable here, in part because his face is covered with a scruffy beard. Other character actors do their jobs, with special note being given to Lionel Atwill. A particularly nice touch is when Atwill and Rathbone are playing darts, and Atwill holds his darts by sticking them into his wooden arm! This is a good horror film and well worth watching. The sets are stark and dramatic, and really aid the film. Highly recommended.",

Basil Rathbone is great fun in the title role, Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, who comes to claim his inheritance upon the passing of his father, and in no time flat causes no end of problems trying to clear the family name. He finds that the Monster (Boris Karloff, in his final performance in the part) is still alive but not doing well, and that the evil Ygor (Bela Lugosi, in one of his best ever performances), an evil body snatcher who managed to survive a hanging and a resulting broken neck, has a powerful hold on the Monster, and that it is doing Ygor's bidding, all in the name of vengeance. \"Son of Frankenstein\" is notable for a number of things. To start with, it has good atmosphere as so many Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s did, but it takes place in a more modern setting, with Lee taking away some of the Gothic trappings of their other productions. We do still see wonderful lab sets, a foul looking sulphur pit which we know will have to be paid off at some point, and the standard issue angry villagers, although by this point the set up is familiar and rather formulaic. We know without a doubt that Wolf is going to be intrigued with his father's work, too intrigued for his own good, and that he will spend too much time trying to rehabilitate the Monster rather than just finding a way to end its suffering and saving everybody a whole lot of trouble. What makes \"Son of Frankenstein\" something worth savouring are the ingenious characters of Ygor, whom Lugosi plays to the hilt, and the tough, stolid Inspector Krogh, a one-armed policeman portrayed with conviction by the always delightful Lionel Atwill; fans automatically recognize that this is the character that inspired Kenneth Mars's Inspector Kemp in Mel Brooks's \"Young Frankenstein\". A decent supporting cast also helps, including Josephine Hutchinson as Wolfs' lovely wife Elsa, and old pros like Lionel Belmore and Michael Mark. Unfortunately, the Monster just doesn't get to do too much this time around, as the accent is largely placed on both Wolf and Ygor. But it's still a treat to see Karloff in the role, and the interplay between Rathbone and Atwill is great, as we see Krogh constantly regarding Wolf with some suspicion even though he has sworn to protect him from the presumptuous villagers, and as Wolf, racked by guilt, starts acting in an antagonistic manner toward the Inspector. Clocking in at 100 minutes, pretty long for a genre film during this period, when they usually came in under 80 minutes, the story is pretty involved, and enjoyable enough that the time goes by quickly enough. The finale is reasonably exciting stuff, and getting there is fun, too. Eight out of 10.",

It looks straight out of Dante's Inferno, another great effect.\n\nI guess my only reservation is with an over-heated Basil Rathbone, of all people. No cool and calculating Sherlock here. In fact, by the end, he's almost chewing the scenery. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. I know he didn't like horror movies (IMDB), so maybe he thought getting over-excited would be a fun departure from his usual icy composure.

That puts the two at about a twenty-five year difference, maybe thirty years.\n\nBasil Rathbone, who had been known to dislike horror films, is the perfect choice for Baron Wolf von Frankenstein. Distinguished and a fine actor. Allegedly, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre had tried out for the part. Lorre is a bizarre consideration, maybe Rains could have done it, but Rathbone is perfect.

The son of Frankenstein, while investigating the decimated ruins of his father's old laboratory, comes upon the comatose remains of the Frankenstein monster still played by Boris Karloff. In addition, the living corpse of Ygor, played by Bela Lugosi (Dracula) keeps a close eye on his half-living, half-dead companion and uses the new Dr. Frankenstein to return life to the green-skinned creature.\n\n\"Son of Frankenstein\" is not a very significant horror movie and is not in the same league as the first two movies of the series, but in comparison to a great many of the sequels that followed, it does stand out as one of the few passable entries. I enjoyed this twice as much as I did the 1994 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\"; Rathbone, Karloff, and Lugosi are all very good in this film. I also liked Lionel Atwill as the one-armed, mustached inspector trying to find out what's going on. I also liked the touch of how the villagers have prejudicially turned on Baron Wolf Frankenstein on account of what his father created before him.\n\nNow what I did not like, and what cost the movie what was potentially a higher rating, was the long moments of dead space in between the monster sequences. Karloff does not have very much to do in this film; he mostly just lies around or stands around. I also did not find the self-destruction approach of Basil Rathbone's character like I did the one with Colin Clive in the first two Frankenstein pictures. The most interesting thing in the movie is Lugosi as Ygor and it does rival his performance in \"Dracula\" (1931). It's just a shame his performance here wasn't in a better, more significant film.\n\nNevertheless, on the whole, I did enjoy \"Son of Frankenstein\" and found it a lot more pleasing than a lot of the absurdly ridiculous follow-ups that came after it. No, it's not in the same league as the original \"Frankenstein\" (1931) or the surprisingly wonderful \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), but very few horror movies are. But it is at the same time a missed opportunity and will probably only work for the fans. I recommend it for three things: Rathbone, Karloff, and Lugosi.",

Universal was considering making this film in Technicolor after obtaining the British-made color film, and after filming began in October 1938, they found out that Karloff's makeup didn't appear correctly in color.

What really short-changes this one is the extremely long running time that slows this one considerably as the build-up to getting the creature to live again really feels way too drawn-out. Though settling the issue of what's going on and getting many of the story lines set up, the fact that it goes into overdrive with the detail of the villagers' distrust of him and their coldness towards the family as well as settling into the castle and preparing to reanimate the creature as there's quite a long time here before anything happens and altogether drags this one out far longer than it really should've been. Even more overlong scenes here come from the rather overblown manner of this one going for the endless scenes of the Baron being questioned and threatened at the end while he's stuck at the house, as the repetitious nature of these scenes quickly wears on the viewer. These here are the film' few flaws, as even though it might not be a classic like the original entries, this one is a lot of fun. Most of that comes from when the discovery of the creature is made, this one really kicks up a little bit with some rather solid action scenes. The initial resurrection is quite spectacular, as it's a little unknown if the experiment will bring it back to life as the various methods used, from the scientific explanations about the creature to the medical work done to fix damage done and the final blow comes in the moment where the electricity comes into play, makes this scene is all the more watchable. When it gets to the monster's first moving appearance as it emerges as a silhouette behind an unsuspecting character and slowly lumbers over to them, it makes for a great visual to open with. That the creature also manages a slight rampage at the end of the film, including the one highlight where it stalks the victim through a mountain pass and the really spectacular part where it goes berserk in the laboratory makes for some exciting scenes. The final fate of the creature is quite exhilarating, making it a little on the sad end of the spectrum, does have a sense of lifting the film out of it's action doldrums and putting some life into the proceedings. As well, the rebuilding of the creature looks quite good and just as great as ever. The last plus here is that the house itself does have some great designs to it that give it a distinct look, featuring a rather impressive Gothic atmosphere with the overall layout and design of the house that's especially true with the huge open spaces in the kitchen and the laboratory as well as the distinct appearance of the stairway in the main room, and then there's the traditional fog- lined set-up that gives this a chilling overall feel. Overall, this was a really fun entry in the series.\n\nToday's Rating/PG: Violence.",

                "text": "Due to unexpected popularity (which caused round-the-block queues) of the original 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' re-screenings, Universal at last lifted their curfew on horror pictures with this hugely budgeted, star-studded sequel to the mighty 'Bride of Frankenstein.' Alongside Basil Rathbone's ambitious Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein, the viewer is literally transported from the real world into a vast, rain-lashed and unforgiving removed reality of horror via a train journey that really does traverse from one to the other very effectively. The town (now also called 'Frankenstein') is populated by those who want nothing to do with the new Baron, his wife, or his mop-headed, curiously Texan-sounding son Peter (played by future voice artist for Bambi, Donnie Dunagan). Understandably, they remember well the chaos brought about by Henry Frankenstein's creation, or more accurately, their own townsfolk's brutal treatment of him.\n\nRathbone is brilliant in this, transforming from impetuous family man to hysterical 'mad doctor' with great skill. Bela Lugosi plays Ygor in one of his greatest performances, a part that was strengthened in order to give Lugosi a greater share of the action. Lionel Atwill, enjoyable in any part, gets probably his best role \u0096 that of Inspector Krogh, the wooden armed Police Inspector determined to protect both Wolf's family and the townsfolk.\n\nThe sets are huge and expressionist, casting great shadows and rising imperiously above the tremendous cast, and the music used here would crop up again and again in future, less well-funded Universal horrors and mysteries.\n\nSo why does this film seem slightly disappointing to me? Even after all this time, I still cannot answer that. Could it be that Peter, such an integral part, is entrusted to a four year old? Dunagan is a terrific performer for his age, but perhaps if the role was given to someone slightly older, they could invest it with just a hint of gravitas. Could it be that a thicker, jowlier Boris Karloff is given a strange sheepskin vest (presumably by friend Ygor, who upstages him regularly) and given no scenes of sympathy as he was so effectively in earlier films? Could it be that the film is just slightly overlong, and suffered from an unfinished script at the time of filming, which as a result, means that it plods \u0096 rather like the monster \u0096 in places? I don't know why I'm less than satisfied by this. Maybe it is because it follows what I consider the greatest film of all time? There's no doubt that so many elements are excellent here, and this clearly is one of the last Universal horrors to benefit from a generous budget (indeed it was their final 'A' production for a Frankenstein film).",

Oddly, there seems to be some serious discrepancies. They take up resident in the castle, which apparently had some wacky art-deco redecoration done in the years since they left.\n\nAnd even though Wolf wasn't even a gleam in his father's eye in Bride, he's a full grown man in at least his 40's. (Rathbone was 47 when this movie was made.) He meets up with Ygor (Played by Bela Lugosi, who turned down the role of the Monster in 1931) a hunchback hanged for assisting the original Frankenstein.

There was very little attempt at continuity between the this film and the previous two, other than getting Karloff back.\n\nSo for some inexplicable reason, Wolfe decides to repower up Dad's monster. It's never really made clear why. Ygor manipulates the monster into going out and killing the jury members who hung him 40 years before. This leads to a confrontation where Wolfe kills Ygor (who still manages to get better in the next movie) and dumps the monster into a sulfur pit.\n\nThe best part is Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh, an officer with a wooden arm who is on to the mad doctor. Atwill was a fixture of 1930's/40's horror, but this is his best remembered role.\n\nFor all its flaws, it's still a pretty good movie, if you take the first three as a trilogy before they cheapened them in the sequels.

The castle of Frankenstein set was great. Very large and creepy looking. The Lab wasn't as strong as the one used in Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein but the added sulfur pit was a good addition. Ygor played by Bela Lugosi (who played Dracula is the Dracula series) played a great part by being Frankensteins puppet master. Basil Rathbone acting was very good for this time.

Lee, Screenplay Wyllis Cooper.\n\nThis film was the sequel to \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and is the third and last of the Frankenstein film franchise that Universal Pictures profited from after the success of the original \"Frankenstein\". The story is not elaborate, nor complex, nor as interesting as the original Frankenstein. Rather, it's formulaic and a sort of re-telling of the original with Dr. Frankenstein's son the Baron Wolf (Basil Rathbone)taking over his father's monster-making and being responsible for the danger and threat in the same town that Frankenstein had once terrorized. He comes to claim his inheritance, Frankenstein Castle, with his wife and son, Elsa and Peter (Josephine Hutchinson and Donnie Dunagan). Immediately, Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) suspects that the Baron will soon fall under the same \"Frankenstein\" spell and he would revive the monster previously thought dead. This is exactly what he does, though he justifies his actions by stating he's conducting important scientific experiments in discovering what makes the monster click and what makes him superhuman and how he could get men to tame him. But his scientific ambitions are foiled when the monster, seduced by Igor (Bela Lugosi) and his hypnotic music, begins to murder villagers once more. The film is good, there's no doubt about it and a worthy successor to the original Frankenstein. It's downside is it's long running time and the lack of action for the first part of the film. It does'nt pick up any real energy or excitement until about the last 15 to 30 minutes when the Monster wreaks havoc in town and even threatens the life of the Baron's son. Boris Karloff owned the role of Frankenstein and here he is allowed to display more emotion and more humanity. Of course, he is the same old stereotypical monster that can't speak intelligently and is actually like a retarded, overgrown adult that can only grrrrrr at everyone, but many scenes depict his sensitivity and his attempt to make sense of the world. He realizes, for example, that the Baron resurrected him, but knowing that he is not a real father figure he turns to Igor, with whom he bonds very closely. When Igor dies, he is so crushed he suddenly gets the concept of revenge, knowing that the Baron has killed him. But for the most part, we see a more tame and less dangerous Frankenstein, seduced into doing evil only by Igor's power. Igor is the real monster here, as he is even able to influence the Baron into reviving the monster. Bela Lugosi (Yes Dracula himself) portrays Igor with great aplomb. Lugosi and Karloff were said to be rivals but working in this film, one can see that they had chemistry, at least on screen, and Bela Lugosi proved he could do more roles than that of Dracula. In \"Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man\" he portrays the Frankenstein Monster. Lugosi's tragedy was the fact that although he tried doing other roles besides Dracula, and he did them well, he could not do anything other than the same type of horror films for Universal and most always in the role of Dracula. But if you want to see Lugosi doing another role, his Igor is his best. Igor is a calm force of evil, having outlived his executioners and he possesses a wicked carelessness that's interesting to watch. This film uses great sets, costumes by Vera West (look at Elizabeth's long gowns) and original music by Frank Skinner which is romantic sounding and dramatic. A lesser film next to the original Frankenstein but a good one nonetheless.",

The monster is dead now, and so is his creator, Dr. Frankenstein. Frankenstein's son Wolf (Basil Rathbone) comes to town to claim his legacy, but it is a more involved legacy than he knows, as the troublemaking Ygor (Bela Lugosi) makes clear. Ygor knows more about the fate of the monster (Boris Karloff) than anyone else, but sharing this knowledge with Wolf comes at a steep price.\n\nI almost titled this review \"Bela Basil and Boris Oh My\" until I realized that shortchanges the best performance in the film, Lionel Atwill's as Inspector Krogh. Atwill is at the heart of what makes \"Son Of Frankenstein\" a good film, his Krogh a figure of both menace and warmth who makes us care a little more about the victims of the monster's crimes than the more cynical if stylish earlier installments did.\n\n\"Son Of Frankenstein\" has style, and sparks of humor, but it also tells a story. Director Rowland V. Lee lacks the polish of the man behind the earlier Frankenstein films, James Whale, but he at least takes the horror more seriously than Whale did in \"Bride of Frankenstein\", a legendary film that doesn't hold up to inspection.\n\n\"Son\", however, does; working the mood of overwhelming dread from the first moments in. Wolf sits with his wife on a train passing a countryside of barren trees enfolded with fog, wondering where his noble father went wrong.\n\n\"Why nine out of ten people call that misshapen creature of my father's experiments...\" \"Frankenstein!\" calls out a conductor, announcing that the town of Frankenstein is the next spot.\n\nLike other posters here, I'm impressed by Lugosi's subtlety and humor, playing Ygor not as a diabolical maniac so much as twisted by his own isolation, not to mention the hanging that broke his neck but left him curiously alive. \"They died...dead!\" he cackles, regarding the men who sentenced him to die. \"I died...live!\" Rathbone is by turns hammy and effective, but the real loss here is Karloff, playing the Monster for the last time. Except for one scene where he catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror, and another near the end where he menaces Wolf's young son, Boris is very much a third wheel in the proceedings. It's good he doesn't repeat the mistake of talking from \"Bride\", but he seems to lose a spark of his otherworldly light in the transition back to the hulking brute of \"Frankenstein\".\n\nThere is also patness at the heart of the story, involving unsolved murders in the village of Frankenstein. We never really rekindle the existential menace of the original \"Frankenstein\", but in its place we do get a story of real human warmth, between Wolf and his family, Wolf and Krogh, even the Monster and Ygor. While not a classic, \"Son\" is a singular treat, combining storyline, atmosphere, and characterization in such a way as to make it a model for classic monster movie making.\n\nJust ask Mel and Gene.",

The single fact that these three are involved in the same work, a beautiful collaboration, is enough to make it one of my favorites! All that was missing was Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Wolf Man. It is also the third (and final) chapter of source material which was later worked into Mel Brooks's phenomenal \"Young Frankenstein\" masterpiece. \n\nSYNOPSIS: Wolf arrives onto the Frankenstein scene for the first time, his wife and young son in tow, to claim his immense legacy. When he and his family arrive, no one seems to welcome him whatsoever. He meets Ygor (or Igor) who asks him to resurrect the Monster who is lying in a coma. An honest attempt is made, but after the apparent failure of Wolf's resurrection attempt, some venerable villagers begin to turn up murdered. Unfortunately, many of the victims are the same villagers who condemned Ygor to the gallows, and it isn't hard for the villagers to piece it all together. Soon after Wolf discovers Ygor is the Monster's puppeteer, the Inspector sent to investigate begins pressuring Wolf to the point of bringing on a fit wherein Wolf kills Ygor. The Monster is so tormented by the sudden loss of his only friend, he goes after Wolf's darling son Peter as a replacement. Wolf must save his son and (he finally hopes to) destroy this walking family curse in the process.\n\nYou can see portions of this work which are obvious studio sets; namely, Henry's lab sequence. From the outside it is obvious and horrible! In the first two chapters, you never really notice, as the action and suspense are adequately riveting that you are distracted from any shortcomings experienced by the editing and backdrops/backgrounds. But in this chapter, the audience is too quickly rushed into the story so that the suspense is not well built of yet, thereby not allowing the audience to be drawn in before introducing factors of bad blending, horrid backgrounds and/or NO attention to set design or details, or Karloff's sudden stilted performance. He is still formidable as Frankenstein's Monster, but his performance is lacking in this work. He lacks the ability to generate sympathy, as if his heart is not in this work. Unfortunately, after this chapter, the role is no longer Karloff's.

I've always found that marginally odd...and a bit off putting. \n\nNonetheless, Rathbone's Frankenstein is one of style and grace, much like Rathbone himself. He generates this sense of fallen nobility in his portrayals, and in this work particularly. Wolf seeks to vindicate his father's work and reputation. A noble and common ideology which, more often than not, results in villainization of the proposed recipient of the vindication. And with that in mind, our story progresses to a rousing, if difficult, end. \n\nIt is still wonderfully done and rates a 7.6/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",

Krogh), Josephine Hutchinson (Elsa Von Frankenstein), Donnie Dunagan (Peter Von Frankenstein), Lawrence Grant(Burgermaster), Lionel Belmore (Emil Lang) \n\nThis is Universal's third installment in the Frankenstein franchise. Unlike some of the other Universal monster sequels such as The Mummy or Invisible Man, the Frankenstein films continued to be fairly big production and this is a rather well made film. The lead character in this movie is Dr. Frankenstein's son Baron. Dr. Frankenstein long ago left the estate but it is still owned by the Frankenstein family and had been taken care of by the family servants. Baron with his wife and son come to the village to lay claim on the estate but they are met with hostility by the local people because of the havoc brought on the place by his father's infamous creation. Baron comes across Ygor (the local shepherd who survived a hanging by the authorities) who shows Baron that the monster is very much alive but comatose. Like his father, Baron is also a scientist and Ygor talks him into reviving the monster. Baron does so hoping he can 'rehabilite' the monster and clear the family name. Things go bad when Igor uses the monster to attack members of the jury responsible for his conviction.\n\nRowland V. Lee, the film's director did a fantastic job especially when one considers that he was filling the shoes of James Whale, not an easy feat! I liked the set design on this film. The grandiosity of the estate reminds me of Citizen Kane. The monster was once again brilliantly played by Boris Karloff, a role he would play in the first three of the five original Universal films. He returned for the last film, House of Frankenstein, but he played a mad scientist not the monster. I have never been a fan of Beli Lugosi as a lead actor (White Zombie is the one exception) but he is perfect for the part of Ygor whom he also played in the next film, Ghost of Frankenstein. The underrated Lionel Atwill is also here as the Inspector. This is a top rated entry in the Frankenstein series. The last two films (which I will eventually review) are not up to par with the first three but are still enjoyable.",

To me, he stole the show from three other fine actors, Basil Rathbone, Lionel Atwill, and even rival Boris Karloff. Frank Skinner's score helped make this movie a personal favorite as well.

There he discovers unfriendly villagers, an intelligent constable, Ygor, and the hidden monster.  The script is cohesive and quite witty at times, focusing on the relationships between the characters.  Beware, the monsters role is smaller in this film, more a supporting character to the more dramatic leads.\n\nThe great draw back to this film is the low-budget scenery.  The castle looks like, and may have been, the inspiration for the demented architecture in Beetlegeuse, breaking the atmospheric rhythm of the past two films.\n\nThe great strength of this film, and an unusual one for the horror genre, is the acting, which ranges from fair to excellent on occasion. The cast including Basil Rathbone, Lionel Atwill, and Boris Karloff, seem comfortable with their roles, and are generally convincing in them. However, the great stand-out is Bela Lugosi.

One dramatic problem is the way Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill are permitted to steal the show between them, yet never permitted to meet.  Basil Rathbone - whom I admire - is out of sorts, going through the motions with a tolerable line in developing rant, but without really drawing you into his torment. Lugosi's revenge plot is hand-me-down and ordinary, a dilution of and distraction from the core Frankenstein mythos.  Then there's Karloff, still unforgettably iconic, a wonderful fusion of make-up, cinematography and physical performance.  But even here there's compromise.  It looks as if the film's consciousness of Karloff's greatness in the role makes it determined to turn the Monster's scenes into virtuoso showcases: so we get all the various moods-the tenderness, the sudden violence, the 'demoniacal calm' the Variety reviewer eloquently noted in 1931 - rather by numbers.  His final plummet into boiling sulphur is a bit of a damp squib, too; director Lee lacks James Whale's minute control.  At least Karloff doesn't talk, though.\n\nWhat might have made the movie something special is a better child actor in the pivotal role of Peter von Frankenstein, the young son of Rathbone and his clothes-horse wife (Hutchinson).  (It's intriguing that the wife's called Elsa: perhaps there's a glance at Elsa Lanchester who played the female creation in James Whale's The Bride of Frankenstein, further encouraging the confusion - here a genuine moral confusion - between the scientist and the monster.)  Peter's role provides a centre for that stratum of filial and paternal anxiety that runs through Universal's Frankenstein story: Lionel Atwill - giving a performance of great charm, humour and authority as Inspector Krogh - takes to Peter as a surrogate son, having none of his own, whilst the Baron increasingly isolates himself; the Monster, too, retains his soft spot for kiddies from the earlier films, increasingly sentimentalized here (odd parallels with the Alien sequels suggest themselves).  In fact, Krogh and the Monster are rather well matched, both partly artificial (something the Monster is responsible for in the case of Krogh's artificial arm), both walking stiffly in a parody march, the Inspector having unfulfilled soldierly fantasies left over from childhood.  Peter, too, is unselfconsciously violent, addicted to the fantasy of big game hunting.  Yet none of the three - Peter, the Monster or the Inspector - strikes one as a naturally violent character.  (Whereas, despite the protestations of sweet wife, one gets the impression with Rathbone's Baron that violence is natural to him, and needs little excuse to come out; his game of darts looks dangerous in a way Peter's rifle toting doesn't.)  This interesting substratum doesn't get far, mostly because the child actor (Donnie Dunagan) is designer cute, and gives an uninteresting performance, lacking in intensity.  If the unflinching quality of his gaze, his willingness to look at everything, and in looking to master it, could have been conveyed, then I think the transmission of a family curse from generation to generation would have begun to develop real tragic resonance. Without that special quality, 'Son of Frankenstein' falls short.",

Electrical junk abounds and Van De Graaff generators, with their high voltage and low current, send crackling bolts of lightning all over the place.\n\nThe purpose of all this display is to bring back to life the monster created by Basil Rathbone's father. The monster is played for the last time by Boris Karloff.\n\nRathbone is Wolf Frankenstein, a research physician, who moves with his family into the castle on the edge of Village Frankenstein.

This isn't Rathbone's default state. I saw him on Broadway in a production of Archibald MacLeach's \"J.B.\" He was one of Job's \"comforters\" and he STILL was authoritative, commanding, and a little mean. Small comfort.\n\nThe sets are well constructed. The Rathbone breakfast nook is the size of the Astrodome and has no furniture except a tiny table in the middle of a great empty space.

In my opinion, Karloff did a super acting job in portraying the monster's emotions with gestures, facial expressions, and mannerisms. Later, when I saw Bride of Frankenstein, I thought that speech greatly diminished the mystique and horror of the creature. Bride was a great movie, and Karloff's acting was super, but the movie just wasn't scary--and after all, it was supposed to be a horror flick.\n\nSpeaking of scary, I was a young kid when I saw Son of Frankenstein, and it scared the heck out of me.

The creators of this second follow-up (including the director Rowland V. Lee and the writer Wyllis Cooper) wisely added their own peculiar humor as well and created yet another excellent film, joining \"Bride\" on that short list of great pointless sequels.\n\nThe son (Basil Rathbone) of Henry Frankenstein has returned with his wife and young boy to the village where his father had created a monster (Boris Karloff), which turned murderous, thus blackening the name of Frankenstein among the villagers and making the prodigal son a pariah. Wolf Frankenstein becomes obsessed with his father's legacy; and when he discovers through a broken-necked freak named Ygor (Bela Lugosi) that the monster lives on in a coma, he decides to revive him.\n\n\"Son of\u0085\" has three memorably eccentric performances. My favorite is that of Lionel Atwill, who plays a local inspector in a military uniform. He uses a mechanical arm to replace the one the Monster had torn out when he was a child (\"One doesn't easily forget, Herr Baron, an arm torn out by the roots\"). Atwill does two things that amaze me. One: he makes the business with the arm hilarious without ever seeming insincere or parodic. Two: he's oddly sympathetic, considering that he never seems to aim for the effect and that his character's main purpose is to foil the protagonist. Next is Bela Lugosi as the broken-necked Ygor. (Apologizing for coughing in someone's face: \"A bone gets stuck in my throat.\") Lugosi's Hungarian accent and mannered diction made him a very limited actor, but within those limitations he could give splendid performances, as this film shows. Third is Basil Rathbone, who descends into near madness and hysteria without losing our sympathy. Karloff also has several good moments, even though he is given little to do (a situation which inspired him to drop out of the series at this point and never again play the role that made him famous).\n\nFrankenstein's weird castle, with its jutting angles, jagged edges, strange shadows, boar-faced gargoyles and huge empty spaces make it the most unliveable family home in moviedom.\n\nThere's plenty to enjoy; but the story is the weakest of the first three \"Frankenstein\" entries. Scenes play out far too long, and few of the plot twists are particularly interesting. It's always the performances, dialogue, sets and lighting that keep us entertained. But that's enough.",

Rowland V. Lee takes up the director's chair, while the screenplay is direct from the imagination of writer Wyllis Cooper; though it takes in characters created by Mary Shelly. The film benefits from a number of star additions to the cast, including horror icon Bela Lugosi, along with Lionel Atwill and Sherlock Holmes himself; Basil Rathbone, in the lead role. And, of course, Boris Karloff returns as the iconic monster. This film would also appear to be the one that influenced Hammer studios to continually think up new sequels to their massive success, The Curse of Frankenstein. The plot follows the son of Dr Frankenstein, who returns to his father's estate some time after the original doctor's death. He soon meets the mysterious Ygor, who has the monster in a room below Frankenstein's laboratory. When Frankenstein's son is asked to help treat the monster...he can't stop himself picking up where his father left off.\n\nThis film takes the idea of the villagers treating Frankenstein's son with disdain, which results in a very paranoid film as Basil Rathbone continually tries to convince Lionel Atwill's inspector that he has nothing to do with the new spree of murders causing panic in the village. Basil Rathbone is very much the lead in this film, and he's always excellent in that role. The man has a lot of charisma, and this role sees him bring it out. I'd even go as far as to say that I preferred him in the lead to Colin Clive in the original. The pace is always very relaxed, and it has to be said that this second sequel isn't as exciting on the whole as James Whale's original. The film is also a little on the long side, clocking up almost one hundred minutes. There's more than enough to make up for this, however; as the Gothic locations are a treat, and Wyllis Cooper's script really is excellent. The four stars help one another, and it's great to see all these icons in a movie together. Karloff isn't given that much to do; but both Atwill and Lugosi are outstanding as they lead the film from the back. Writing a new story based on a great classic and making it good can't be easy, but this film manages it. Son of Frankenstein is both a worthy successor to what James Whale and Mary Shelly put forward, and is also a great horror classic in its own right. Highly recommended!",

                "text": "Third and last great entry in the Frankenstein series and certainly among the most satisfying sequels ever. It started the second outburst of Universal horror films and while this never reached the heights of the 1931-6 boom, the beginning was promising indeed.\n\nActually, this was only my second viewing of the film and so its plot details, coupled with the artistry with which it is made, managed to yield as much genuine surprise as immense pleasure throughout. James Whale, director of the first two Boris Karloff Frankenstein films, seems to have scoffed at the way the saga would progress but Rowland V. Lee certainly did nothing here that might shame Whale's unique vision - which, however, can't be said of any of the subsequent entries!\n\nThe film features a compelling narrative with strong characterizations and involves a variety of elaborate sets which rival those of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) in their weird stylization. In fact, these two films have probably the highest production values of all the Universal horror output, which alone goes to prove that this third 'episode' was no rush job but a meticulously planned - and executed - affair! This richness extends to the delightful if overlong script and the outstanding performances of the four stars: Basil Rathbone is an intellectual but edgy Frankenstein (I find his overacting here intoxicating and, quite honestly, one of the undoubted highlights of the film - pity he seemed not to care enough for the role to warrant a mention in his autobiography!); much has been said, too, about Karloff's lack of purpose this time around: I disagree, as he has plenty of opportunities to shine (particularly the mirror scene with Rathbone and his final rampage, certainly among the best bits of acting he's ever done!) and, in any case, he's always fascinating to watch in that make-up - and the sheepskin he wears throughout is an added treat; Bela Lugosi manages to steal the picture with a surprisingly fine turn as Ygor, a great characterization in any film but pitted against Rathbone's histrionics and alongside Karloff's semi-comatose monster (acting as an evil influence upon it, much as Ernest Thesiger had in BRIDE), he is extremely effective - in fact, Lugosi and Karloff's rapport here echoes the one the latter shared with Brember Wills in James Whale's masterful THE OLD DARK HOUSE (1932) and which sadly wasn't replicated in the next entry, THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942), with the monster now played by Lon Chaney Jr.!; Lionel Atwill has his best role in a Universal horror film as one-armed Inspector Krogh - which rather typecast him from then on as a figure of authority! - but, again, his scenes with Rathbone are to be relished (notably the celebrated game of darts), developing from protectiveness towards the Baron to admiration, suspicion and, ultimately, sacrifice!\n\nThe rest of the cast features series staples like Lionel Belmore and Michael Mark but also horror regulars like Edgar Norton and Gustav von Seyffertitz; Josephine Hutchinson is okay as the current Baroness Frankenstein but Donnie Dunagan's acting as the couple's son is an abomination and, while Karloff's impulse to throw him into the sulphur pit at the bottom of the laboratory - in retaliation for Lugosi's killing by Rathbone - may be construed as a bit extreme, the child nonetheless would have deserved just that fate for his irritating performance alone! The action-packed climax, as mentioned, is memorable and exciting; in fact, even if the film can feel unnecessarily long-winded at times (especially when compared to the brisker earlier entries), it never becomes boring - thanks, in no small measure, to George Robinson's exquisite cinematography throughout and Frank Skinner's magnificently lush score (which Universal apparently recognized, too, as they returned to it time and again in future!).",

                "text": "\n'Bride Of Frankenstein' is arguably the greatest horror movie ever made so any sequel to it couldn't help but disappoint. 'Son Of Frankenstein' is entertaining but doesn't measure up to the high standards of the first two movies in the series. James Whale is nowhere to be found and his lack of involvement shows. This movie is much less imaginative and original than the previous films. It is neither as disturbing or as amusing as they were. Bela Lugosi however gives one of his greatest performances as the broken necked Ygor, and I would recommend this movie to every horror fan for his performance alone. Basil Rathbone and Lionel Atwell are also both very good and the latter adds a touch of the bizarre humour seen in 'Bride..'. It's a pity there wasn't much more of that going on. The real disappointment is Karloff who does very little, and for some reason the Monster has lost the power of speech which he had acquired in the previous movie. Karloff gave an outstanding performance in 'Bride...' but isn't all that memorable in 'Son...' and one imagines this is why he stopped playing the character. So, a mixed bag overall. Karloff is disappointing but Lugosi is great. 'Son Of Frankenstein' is uneven but Lugosi and Atwill make it worth watching.",

Karloff doesn't get a chance to do much and loses some of the feeling from his earlier turns as the monster.  Rathbone hams it up but is fun in most of his scenes.  Lionel Atwill is fantastic as the one-armed police inspector.  Bela Lugosi exhibits great passion and is excellent as Igor.  The script is pretty loose and is not nearly as good as the two previous Frankenstein movies.  The movie is the first of the formulaic Frankenstein movies, where the monster is found and rejuvenated while the angry villagers complain before finally taking up arms and torches.  Son of Frankenstein isn't a bad movie but isn't nearly as good as Frankenstein or as fun as Bride of Frankenstein.  \n\n6.7/10",

                "text": "This is a very handsome production with striking design and three good performances at its heart. Basil Rathbone and Lionel Atwill are always fun to watch, but Bela Lugosi is especially good in this movie. He plays evil with real relish.\n\nAlthough it does not really add anything new to the Frankenstein saga, Universal are to be congratulated for trying to make a movie that is not merely cashing in on James Whale's two great movies but is a worthy successor to them. I wish I liked it more.\n\nThe problem is that, for all its merits, this picture is somewhat ponderous and a bit dull. Every scene is slightly over-written and allowed to drag on too long. Each small plot point is painstakingly established, with the result that it takes 55 minutes for Karloff's Creature to be restored. However, it is only at this point that the actual story can begin. The plodding literalism of the story-telling is in sharp contrast to the allusive spirit of the the production design.\n\nRoland V Lee's direction does nothing to help. He is unable to get any energy into the picture because, too often, his camera is perched well away from the action so that he can give us beautifully composed wide shots of the elaborate expressionist sets. It looks like a succession of great stills rather than a movie.\n\nI found myself wondering if a good editor could take 15 minutes out of the picture and give it some pace. I doubt it, because of the relatively static staging and the shortage of close-ups and two-shots. For good or ill, this is the picture that Universal made and there is no point in wishing it was any different.\n\nIt is an honest, earnest, decently-crafted movie, but there is no way to hide its basic problem: there is not enough plot to fill its generous 97 minutes.\n\nI give it full marks for trying, but its good intentions cannot make it into the Gothic classic it aspires to be.",

                "text": "Just watched this movie for the first time since I was a kid. Wow! Considering the talent involved how did this movie drift, nay, run astray?\n\nAfter reading a number of reviews, the consensus was that the stylistic sets were acceptable for the most part or even seen as a plus for the film, but not so for me. A misfire of a choice for what should have been a traditional Gothic style/medieval architecture, why argue with success? What did the director et al. do? Sit around thinking \"how do we reduce the atmosphere of dread, fear and foreboding?\" And what was the style? Expressionist? Minimalist? It looked like the scenery budget was cut to be able to hire the full lineup of Universal's horror stars. The interiors of the castle looked like they were hastily thrown together in an afternoon. And what happened, couldn't they afford even one fake spiderweb? It was an equally irritating distraction on par with Rathbone's constant barrage of tantrums.\n\nThe other major misjudgement that irked me was the ending. I was stunned! Besides bringing the monster back to life and so being partially responsible for the deaths that occurred, Wolfie was constantly lying to everybody to keep his secret. But at the end everybody, the police chief, his wife and all the townspeople not only forgive him, they love him, treat him like a hero, having only moments earlier thrown down their scythes, hangman's ropes and such. He must have had quite a PR man. Or maybe it was the caliber of the Frankenstein villagers, hearts so big they explode! ha ha! And he must have had a good lawyer, too, considering how many laws he broke. Wasn't it grand to have such a forgiving wife whose husband constantly lied to minimize the dangerous situation he put her and their son in.\n\nOne last thing I just thought of. There really wasn't anybody likable in this movie, especially the kid with his southern accent. (Even he was involved in a murder - didn't the police chief find Benson's watch on him, which made him the prime suspect? Those Frankenstein's are just bad blood)",

They are making this journey so that Wolf can reclaim all that is his family heritage. He knows that they may not be welcome because of the scientific work of his father in creating a monster, that monster - long dead - now synonymous with the name Frankenstein and who wreaked havoc on the town including purportedly killing several townsfolk. Regardless, Wolf believes his father was a genius, and that the experiment of creating a live being out of dead tissue was revolutionary, but a project that got out of hand for reasons outside his control. Wolf finds that Police Inspector Krogh vows to protect him and the Frankensteins against any backlash from the townsfolk, who, despite the monster being dead, are still anxious as unexplained deaths have still been occurring in recent years that they do attribute to the monster. Krogh's assistance is despite the monster negatively affecting his own personal life. Wolf finds that one of his father's former assistants. Ygor, wants to help Wolf. Ygor was also vilified by the townsfolk, they who failed to kill Ygor by hanging years ago. As Wolf tries to reclaim all that was his father's, he will find that he may face the same fate as his father in that there are other forces outside his control who are working toward their own end goal incompatible with his.",

Wolf tries to revive the monster and believes he fails but then some of the locals are found murdered soon after who just happened to be part of the jury that sent Ygor to the gallows. The villagers immediately connect the killings to Frankenstein and send the inspector to investigate. He discovers the monster is alive and is being used as tool by Ygor. Wolf then in fit of madness shoots Ygor. The then enraged monster losing his only friend kidnaps Wolf's son.

                "text": "Mexican SPITFIRE AT SEA is a typical door-slamming, vaudevillesque comedy for the fairly popular film series, an endless string of malapropisms, mistaken identities, and double-crossing pushed with gusto by a talented cast working hard to ring out every possible laugh. Carmelita and Dennis (Lupe Velez, Charles Buddy Rogers) are on a cruise ship on what she believes will be a second honeymoon but is actually an attempt to gain the business account of the social climbing George Skinners (Eddie Dunn, Florence Bates), eager to meet Uncle Matt's friend, Lord Basil Epping (both roles played by Leon Errol). When Carmelita learns the truth she throws a fit and threatens to leave and Skinner mistakenly believes blonde bombshell Fifi (Marion Martin) is actually Dennis' wife forcing him to continue the fib. Uncle Matt meanwhile believes Lord Epping is not onboard and is forced to impersonate him - with passenger ZaSu Pitts, a stagestruck wanna-be actress, persuaded to impersonate Lady Epping.\n\nThe comedy is frantic and often quite funny, particularly Lupe and her fractured tirades (informed Dennis has \"another wife\" she screams, \"That's bigotry!\") Veteran character comic Leon Errol gets the lion's share of screen time in the dual role of Uncle Matt and Lord Epping and while he's funny, many of the scenes seem like repeats from scenes just moments before and it can be a bit much. The role of Carmelita's husband is always a thankless one and it's disappointing to see the appealing Charles Buddy Rogers wasted in the smallish part (which would eventually be played by no less than three actors in the seven film series). Character actress Elisabeth Risdon is around as usual as Matt's rather haughty wife who can't stand Carmelita and she's very good, as is the excellent comedienne Florence Bates as a barge of a social climber.",

Scheming Aunt Della utilizes friction between Carmelita and Dennis to pair him with returning French sexpot Fifi in order to pull off the latest deal with Lord Epping. A galaxy of surprise guests add to the confusion, and the result is a 72 minute slapstick delight that is guaranteed to provide a gamaray of giggles.\n\nDown to the wire in the sixth entry in this eight film series, Lupe Velez still has what it takes to get a laugh by having a temper tantrum (or just showing off her sexy gams), and rubber-legged Leon Errol is back to his old tricks as well. Whether tossing insults at wife Elisabeth Risdon while in his Lord Epping disguise or confusing a business rival with ridiculous suggestions for the Epping family crest, Errol is a droll delight. Marion Martin is back for the second of three appearances as \"Mexican Spitfire's Baby\", a calmer French version of Velez's Carmelita, whose fractured English with a French twist is as humorous as Velez's constant Ricky Ricardo like assassination of the English language.\n\nAmong those who drop in for this entry are portly Florence Bates as a social climbing wife of Dennis's latest client (Harry Holman), proving just how phony polite society can be, and Zasu Pitts as a hammy playwright and actress who is delightful camping it up as a truly lousy thespian. Watch Pitts' reaction as she deals with the group making faces at her while screaming (thinking she is deaf) and Risdon's spotting of Errol (whom she believes to be her husband) with the very droll Lady Epping.\n\nThe story is as far from original as practically every other entry, but the farcical moments are more abundant and the result is one of the series' better entries. Buddy Rodgers as Dennis is better than both the original (Donald Woods) or his own replacement (Walter Reed), and so the sparring between him and Velez comes off with more heat, as does their romance when the two aren't fighting.",

Because what would a Mexican Spitfire movie be without Leon Errol as the star? When Carmelita finds out the real reason for the trip, she becomes enraged and threatens, once again, to leave Dennis.\n\nHonestly this series tires me out. Watching Carmelita shout and carry on like a child with a tantrum in front of a whole crowd of people is not funny. It just makes me want to fast forward to whenever she's not on the screen anymore. Don't even get me started on stupid Dennis, who apparently has no sex drive. But with the way he parts his hair I'm not surprised. There are some characters from the last movie that are shoehorned into this one. I might complain about Zasu Pitts but I would never complain about any excuse to look at beautiful Marion Martin again. Elisabeth Risdon also returns as Uncle Matt's wife, who remains just about one of the most unlikable people ever. It's a very repetitive series with the same material recycled over and over. If you have never seen a Mexican Spitfire movie, then this one is no better or worse than any other. But if you have seen others, you'll find yourself bored because of the lack of originality.",

Meanwhile, a pretty nurse is searching for them in the woods assuming that they are lost. Will her and her fianc\u00e9e reach the boys in time or will the killer strike again?

The East Side Kids acted differently than, and looked different from, The Bowery Boys. -- The Bowery Boys films had more of a \"Three Stooges\" look and feel to them, and had none of the adolescent angst than can sometimes be seen in The East Side Kids films.

Having Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, and the rest of the gang being paired with Bela Lugosi is an intriguing thought, and it certainly seems as if it could have been the basis for a really entertaining movie. Perhaps the biggest letdown is simply that Lugosi never gets a lot to do, so that he does not really get the chance to become a part of things.\n\nThe setup is kind of convoluted, and it takes a fair amount of time to get to the main action, which has the gang roaming around in an old abandoned mansion where Lugosi's character has just taken up residence. Long stretches of the movie are carried simply by the interplay among Muggs and the rest of the group as they explore, stumble around, and get lost in various situations, all the while wisecracking, ad-libbing, and playing with the props.\n\nAs always, most of these antics are quite entertaining, but here the actual story is too negligible to sustain its end of things. A more carefully written story, and most importantly a better, less thankless role for Lugosi, could have made much better use of this unusual combination of talent.",

This, the earlier of the two movies is heavier on the haunted house atmospherics which the East Siders use to fire off their gags and one liners. Lugosi comes complete with his Count Dracula outfit and midget sidekick Angelo Rossitto; the long view of his mountaintop retreat is reminiscent of the sinister house in \"Psycho\".\n\nWhat's kind of neat about the story as it progresses is that the boys all take turns teaming up with each other as they search for their injured buddy Peewee (David Gorcey) in the huge Billings Estate. Peewee seems to be in a trance after being treated by Nardo (Lugosi), so his pals connect Nardo to the 'monster killer' they heard about on the radio on the way to camp. In between the sound and sight gags, Scruno (Sunshine Sammy Morrison) has some fun with the stereotyped scaredy cat role he's given as the black member of the East Siders - \"I'm so scared I'm turnin' white now\"; and later - \"A white spider, that must have been the ghost of the black widow!\" It all comes across as pretty harmless, but done today, the political correctness police would be all over it.\n\nThere's a line Lugosi speaks in the film that reminded me of his performance in 1931's \"Dracula\". In that earlier film, a wolf howls in the distance and Dracula says to Renfield - \"Listen to them... children of the night, what music they make.\" Under similar circumstances in \"Spooks\", while walking through the Hillside Cemetery, he remarks - \"City of the dead. Do they too hear the howling of the fighting dogs?\" I wonder if that line was intended as a tribute to the horror classic.\n\nFrom the outset, I had the idea that the old switcheroo would take Lugosi off the hook as the monster killer; indeed it turned out to be the spooky Dr. Von Grosch (Dennis Moore) who almost claimed Linda Mason (Dorothy Short) from the camp as his latest victim. Lugosi's convincing along the way though, even getting to use a version of that famous stare down from \"Dracula\" and \"White Zombie\".\n\nThe diminutive Rossitto appeared with Lugosi a couple more times in pictures, in 1942's \"The Corpse Vanishes\", and 1947's \"Scared to Death\". He doesn't have a lot to do in any of the stories, in fact he doesn't even speak in this one, but his presence adds just a slight dash of bizarreness to the proceedings.\n\nAt just over an hour in length, \"Spooks Run Wild\" is a fun diversion, but don't expect a tight script or much in the way of story development. It's all in the gags, one liners and Leo Gorcey's malapropisms. If you're putting together your list of films for Halloween fright night, this would be a good one to start off with.",

The camp escorts, played in an excessively understated manner by Dave O'Brien and Dorothy Short, are.

The Boys are scared shirtless (although they try to play it cool) as they wander through the haunted house, get lost and find secret passages etc etc etc. Somehow O'Brien emerges as the hero after he saves our mostly absent heroine and everything's okay, presumably for the rest of the disadvantaged summer.

Trying to get the boys to straighten themselves out PAL lawyer Jeff Dixon, Dave O'Brien, has them enrolled in a camp for the summer to learn the finer things in life like sunshine fresh air and unharmonized milk.\n\nLead by their fearless and though talking leader Muggs, Leo Grocey, the East Side Kids skip camp and end up being locked up in this creepy and electricity deprived haunted house. It's there where their hounded by this \"Monster Killer\" who's terrorizing the local population with three murders already under his belt. Muggs together with Danny, Bobby Jordan, and Skimpy, Hurtz Hall, at first try to help fellow gang member Peewee, David Grocey, who was shot, by a night watchman, as he walked through the cemetery near the haunted house. Joined by both Scruno and Skinny, Ernest Morrison & Donald Hines, Muggs tries to get the badly injured Peewee help only to run into the master of the house the mysterious Nardo, Bela Lugosi, and his two foot eleven inch assistant Luigi, Angelo Russitto.\n\n****SPOILERS**** Were ,and the East Side Kids, are kept in the dark to who this \"Monster Killer\" really is until the very end of the movie when, it becomes obvious to everyone watching, his secret identity is finally revealed. The movie itself,in order to keep he cost down, is so lax in the lighting department that most of the time you can't make out what's happening in it! All this just about cancels out the slap stick action scenes in the movie that the zany East Side Kids are noted for. \n\nThe great Bela Lugosi, as Nordo, is about the only reason to watch \"Spook's Run Wild\" in that like in all the bargain basement films that he was in, during the last fifteen years of his life, Lugosi raise the grad Z-movie up a few notches. It's to his credit that Lugosie doesn't, like everyone else in the movie, takes himself seriously. This has him comes across more of a comedian in making fun of himself then the villain you would have expected Bela Lugosi to be in the film. As for Lugosi, or Nordo's, sidekick Luigi he's so small and hard t follow, in the dark, that at times he looks like a talking, and moving, head without a body attached to it! \n\nThere's also Dave O'Brien, as Jeff Dixon, who's reunited in the movie with his wife Dorothy Short who plays nurse Linda Mason. The two are best remembered as the ill fated and tragic young couple in that timeless 1938 anti-pot/marijuana classic \"Reefer Madness\". There's also in the soundtrack of \"Spooks Run Wild\" the theme song, or instrumental arrangement , of Lugosi's 1940 mad scientist and horror classic \"The Devil Bat\" where he played a deranged and vindictive perfume and mens cologne annalist.",

They end up in a small town and decide to walk away from shelter and end up in a creepy haunted castle with a strange man (Bela Lugosi) inside.\n\nSPOOKS RUN WILD isn't a very good movie as it does very little \"right\" but at the same time I must admit that I watch it quite often because there's just something rather charming about it. Seeing The East Side Kids mix it up with Bela Lugosi should have made for a much better movie but it's obvious this was made on the cheap and very quickly. I'm sure most of the scenes here could have done better but they weren't really going for quality but instead something to get onto movie screens quick.\n\nI think the greatest thing the film offers is Lugosi in a very colorful performance. I'm sure he was probably wondering why he had to appear in something like this but the actor still gave it his all and delivered a rather fun performance. Just check out the highlight of the picture when Lugosi goes to complete terror when a skeleton is coming after him. So much energy and passion can be seen here, which is something only Lugosi could deliver. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but there's no question that the screenplay didn't give them much to work with.\n\nAgain, SPOOKS RUN WILD is a pretty poor movie. The dialogue is rather weak and there's no question that there's not too much to the actual story. Still, if you're a fan of Lugosi then it's pretty much worth watching just for his performance alone.",

Most of it is because several of the actors associated with this series were obnoxious and unlikable (Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall come immediately to mind). The rest of it is because most of their films are poorly written and terribly unfunny--a real problem when they are supposed to be comedies! In light of my hatred, SPOOKS RUN WILD came as such a surprise. Okay, it isn't high art or a must-see film, but considering it paired the unfunny group with Bela Lugosi (who at this point in his career would appear in anything--and I do mean anything), it was much, much better than it should have been and is an agreeable time-passer.\n\nThe obnoxious teens go off to summer camp for underprivileged inner city kids. Oddly, even though the radio announces that a serial killer is loose, they STILL take the boys to the camp which is exactly where the maniac was spotted. Perhaps they thought that their deaths would be a public service. Anyway, the guys decide to wander around at night (huh?) and eventually find themselves in a haunted mansion with Bela Lugosi and his silent dwarf assistant, Luigi. Considering that Lugosi is dressed a lot like Dracula, it isn't surprising that the boys think Lugosi and Luigi are killers and they spend most of the rest of the film running about the mansion getting into trouble. Considering everything, it's amazing how patient Lugosi's character was with the boys, as he seems to take all their antics in stride (perhaps that was the morphine kicking in).\n\nThe film features some decent though not big laughs. Many of the best lines are delivered by the Black member of the gang, Sunshine Sammy. Now in the 21st century, his being called \"Sunshine Sammy\" and a few of his antics might be seen as very politically incorrect. However, in context, he was an excellent character and very progressive for the day. He was as liked as any White member of the gang in the film and they didn't make any of the stereotypical \"Black guy in a haunted house\" jokes.\n\nOverall, this is an important film for Bela Lugosi fans. I am certainly one of them and have even seen just about all his very worst films. I had resisted seeing this one because I thought being from Monogram Films (a very low-budget studio) and with the East Side Kids it would be just another bad horror flick--but I was pleasantly surprised. Others might also enjoy it, but it's not much more than a fair time-passer.\n\nFYI--The boys and Lugosi teamed up again two years later in GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE. It isn't as good as SPOOKS RUN WILD, but it is still quite watchable.",

O.K., so this was a part of their \"East Side Kids\" days, but whether Dead End Kids, East End, or Bowery, they are still the same, comically utilizing malapropisms every chance they get and driving everybody around them crazy with their non-conformist ways. Now they are being taken on a summer vacation to the country, and what do they do? Escape from their chaperone's and head into a local cemetery where one of them gets shot. So where do they go for help? A mysterious large house up in the hills where the dwarf (Angelo Rossito) opens the door to them. How convenient that the new owner Lugosi had time to install a door knob that the diminutive Rossito could reach and that the little man actually had the strength to open it.\n\nSo reality is never a requirement when you've got Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Sammy Morrison and the others around. It's all about the gags, and here, the spooky nature of the plot adds some very comical ones, whether it be a candle that follows the unsuspecting nearby or lots of secret passages and a set that looks like it could have been made for Dracula's castle. The plot concerns a fiend on the loose who is rumored to be of a supernatural nature (what kind of supernatural creature is never mentioned, but hints of being a vampire or wolf man are mentioned), and of course, Lugosi (whose car is pulling three coffins) is the main suspect. Lugosi is the polite, perfect host, but the boys all realize that something is amiss and plot to take him down.\n\nIt's all innocent fun, wrapped up in just over an hour, and perfectly entertaining. Lugosi would go on to do one more feature with the boys (\"Ghosts on the Loose\"), but this is definitely the better of the two. It is interesting to note that the best Bowery Boys movies were always those that had a fantasy element to the story.

Yet even in the lowest of the low, he was always dependable to turn in a competent performance and he certainly does here.

By the early 40s, Lugosi was consigned to roles painting him as the bogeyman, but this film, while playing off the Dracula persona, does offer a pleasant twist regarding who he really is. There's an irony in this film: the East Side kids are creeped out by him so they always assume the worst, constantly trying to leave or flee his presence. Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and their New York City Bowery buds are up to no good, caught being mischievous and shipped off to a camp for rehabilitation, go for a walk in the woods, when one of them (David Gorcey) is injured on a barbwire fence. Locating the old Billings mansion, the boys find Lugosi and his dwarf assistant, needing a place to rest and possible medical care. The night in this ominous mansion, where candlelight is the method of seeing in the dark, proves eerie for the boys as David walks about in a trance with the expected cobwebs, spiders, skulls, objects moving on their own, and never-ending rooms in the place while they try to find their pal. Lugosi is obviously enjoying the part as he never appears too malevolent or sinister, except the iconic \"camera draws in to his predatory face as he approaches in close-up\", talking to the boys with that thick accent (I personally never tired of despite his criticism for not trying to master the English language) that is almost always polite and civil. It is exactly right to me, this approach, so that what he might or might not be is left to us to determine. The radio announcement of this 'monster killer' does lay seed to whether or not Lugosi is him. Subplot includes a nurse (Dorothy Short) looking for the boys while the camp counselor (Dave O'Brien) remains disenchanted with being nursemaid to them. Dennis Moore is supposed killer hunter out to find Lugosi, but his presence seems anything but heroic. Good atmosphere and Lugosi's charisma help balance the film's dedication to the quipping kids always scattered and confused. Favorite scene for me: the knight's armor and how some of the kids no not what to do. As often was the case, the cops only show up at the very end once the killer is revealed. How the supposed haunts are explained away when Lugosi's occupation is revealed is quite the twist.",

Hall. Though 'Spooks \u0085' seems better budgeted, and certainly looks good and is nicely acted, Rosen wasn't as good a director as Beaudine, and the movie is somewhat bland, somewhat less lively, a bit lazy, and with a less good script; but Lugosi looks awesome, with another side of his talent: the nonchalant gentleman, chivalrous and handsome (his character is shown as not taking offense at the kids' repeatedly roughing him up, or being nasty), moreover he seemed pleased with his role. It begins with very nice footage of urban life, before the kids are sent to the camp. So, the 1st movie has a better look and acting, a fancy storyline, with the self-explained old house, almost a '30s movie, and it relies more on spoof, the intriguing things, like the attendant's insight, are comparatively loosely handled; the 2nd has better a better director and also script and feel, dynamism as zest in handling the subplots, appeal, the subplots (the newlyweds, the old couple, the policemen) are better handled, and funnier, here the several subplots are either teases, or barely sketched (the host walks about the house, the counselor, the constable, Van Grosch). The main difference is the one between a spoof and a comedy. Beaudine handled better than Rosen a better script. Here, the actors playing townspeople act reasonably well, yet the direction is less preoccupied with them than it should have; another difference is that the 2nd movie could boast a better cast (not only the bride, but some supporting roles as well). Let's mention two teases: the likable locations at the beginning (given that the storyline went somewhere else) and the boys marching through the underground tunnel, resurfacing in the cemetery to keep a council, deciding what seems at 1st an obviousness (to confront the bird, since they lack silver bullets and onion), then coming across with a good trick, scaring their host. So, though perhaps not as good as its follow-up, this 1st show isn't to be dismissed.\n\nPeewee was Muggs' real-life brother. Pat Costello has a small role as the driver.\n\nRosemary Portia makes a nice bit part, as a waitress.\n\nThe directors of the installments were usually the savvy Lewis (three movies, all in '40), W. Fox (9 movies, in '41-'45), Beaudine (6 movies, in '43-'45); from '42 on, W. Fox and Beaudine were the directors.\n\nThough H. Hall was included relatively lately as an East Side kid, he had been one of the Dead End Kids, on a par with Gorcey, Dell and Jordan.\n\nThe kids arrive at the camp; and the old house isn't their host's.\n\nLugosi gets roughed up a bit by the kids two times. In a story about a sexual predator, he's not the one. Muggs perusing a book belongs to his intellectualized outlook.\n\nThough mostly a farce (and some of the uncanny occurrences witnessed by the kids, like the skull and the moving boll and the skeleton, must or could be attributed to their anxiety, as their host explained them beforehand, while others, like the secret passages and the tunnel leading under the phony tombstone, can't be, and the weird attendant is straight fantasy), when Van Grosch attacks the girl it doesn't look like an attempt to murder her, Dorothy Short's struggle with Van Grosch looks like a rape, and it seems appropriate that sexuality was a topic for a series mainly aimed at teenagers.",

                "text": "SPOOKS RUN WILD (Monogram, 1941), directed by Phil Rosen, the seventh in the \"East Side Kids\" series, is probably best known due to its presence of top-billed Bela Lugosi, the master of horror, whose role as Dracula (Universal, 1931) has made his legendary. Although routinely done on a limited scale, and being a far cry from similar themes produced over at Universal, this entry gets by for what it is - a comedic horror mystery.\n\nThe story begins briefly in the tenement district of New York where the East Side Kids, consisting of Danny (Bobby Jordan), Glimpy (Huntz Hall), Skinny (Bobby Stone), Pee Wee (David Gorcey), Scruno (Sammy Morrison) and its leader, Muggs Maginnis (Leo Gorcey), labeled underprivileged, being escorted by the police into a bus headed to the country for summer camp, as arranged by Jeff Dixon (Dave O'Brien). Dixon, a young man studying to become a lawyer, has a rough job ahead of him looking over these kids while working on his thesis. As the bus makes a stop in a small town called Hillside, the boys enter a sweet shop where Muggs takes an interest in a counter girl named Margie (Rosemary Partia). As Muggs arranges a meeting time with her, an announcement is heard over the radio warning residents to be aware of a \"Monster Killer\" on the loose. In the meantime, a mysterious man, Nardo (Bela Lugosi) and his dwarf assistant, Luigi (Angelo Rossitto) drive through town in a trailer full of coffins heading for the Billings Estate, which has been unoccupied for ten years. Later that evening, Muggs, sneaking out of camp to keep his date with Margie, is followed by his friends. Taking a short cut through the cemetery, Pee Wee is shot by a caretaker. Injured, the boys take him to a nearby mansion on top of the hill where Nardo offers his assistance by giving Pee-Wee a sedative and a room to rest for the night. As overnight guests, the East Side Kids encounter strange happenings, including Pee Wee roaming about in a zombie-like trance. As Linda Mason (Dorothy Short), Jeff's girlfriend and the camp nurse, goes out to search for the missing boys in the dead of night, she soon encounters a Doctor Von Grosch (Dennis Moore) for assistance.\n\nAs with most film series placing its central characters in horror genre cycle or in a residence believed to be haunted, SPOOKS RUN WILD offers nothing new considering how the East Side Kids were involved in similar situations earlier in its second entry, THE GHOST CREEPS, re-titled BOYS OF THE CITY (1940). SPOOKS RUN WILD benefits greatly with Lugosi aboard dressed mostly in black attire as if he were Count Dracula. At one point he's addressed by Muggs as \"Mr. Horror Man.\" There's the usual antics provided by kids ranging black member Scruno's encounter with a white spider; Muggs nearly getting trapped inside a coffin; to Glimpy's reply to Danny of having \"gone to night school\" as his reasoning as to how he can read in the dark, a reply repeated by Huntz Hall playing Sach to Leo Gorcey's Slip in THE BOWERY BOYS MEET THE MONSTERS (1954). Containing much of the familiar Monogram and P.R.C. stock underscoring, SPOOKS RUN WILD, set mostly in the dark of night with the gang carrying lighted candle plates, makes way to some fine suspense with laughs. Actually not bad of this type, with an interesting conclusion rounding up its story.\n\nDistributed on home video in the 1980s, later available on DVD as companion piece to GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE (1943), the second and last East Side Kids comedy featuring Bela Lugosi; SPOOKS RUN WILD has turned up on occasion on Turner Classic Movies (with re-issue Astor Pictures Studio logo in place of Monogram) where it premiered in May 2004. Next in the series, MR. WISE GUY (1942)(**).",

I remember enjoying the earlier one but this one had me partly bored since it took a while before Bela showed up and I didn't notice too many wisecracks from the kids during most of the narrative. In fact, whatever funny lines and scenes there were came mostly from Ernie \"Sunshine Sammy\" Morrison doing a patented scared Negro stereotype caricature but not in too demeaning a manner. There's also some nice scares near the end and I also liked the final scene. So on that note, Spooks Run Wild is at the least, worth a look for fans of the East Side Kids and Bela Lugosi.",

This is generally accepted as the last successful cavalry charge in military history (typically some eggheads - probably Brits - quibble on whether it was a true cavalry charge because the Australians were armed with bayonets rather than sabres; not that the distinction meant much to the unfortunates who ended up skewered on the end of them.)\n\nAlso noteworthy for the presence of Chips Rafferty, in a typical role as a gangling Aussie bushmen, and who, in the days before Paul Hogan, represented the Australian male as he liked to imagine himself.",

Well written it recounts (fictional) events leading up to the Aust. Light Horse charge at Beersheba in World War 1. It shows well the dry, laconic Australian bushman's sense of humour and the capacity for friendship which used to be such a great Australian characteristic.

                "text": "40,000 Horseman tells the story of the Australian Light Horse cavalry which operated in the desert in Palestine and probably has to its credit the last successful cavalry charge in battle, though apparently according to other reviewers some who dispute it. I'm perfectly willing to give credit to Australia for this remarkable achievement.\n\nThe story was filmed in 1940 when Australia had already entered World War II and troops were in the Sahara Desert while this movie was made. For propaganda necessity a hateful German had to be made the villain and Harvey Adams as Van Hausen certainly fills the bill there. To be sure Germans were in the desert, but the bulk of the fighting troops were the Aussies old foes from Gallipoli, the Turks. After all Palestine was part of their Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe film was made by Charles Clauvel who's uncle Sir Harry Clauvel was the actual general in charge of the Australian Light Horse. Perhaps the younger Clauvel was undergoing an attack of modesty, but personally I'd have rather seen the story of the uncle and the battles done in a documentary style like The Longest Day.\n\nHowever several Australian acquaintances have told me that this film is regularly shown on Australian television on ANZAC day. Though the courage of the Aussies at Gallipoli gave the new continent nation a sense of national identity, this film does show them winning this one.\n\nIt's the final cavalry charge at Beersheba which opened the way for General Allenby to take Jerusalem is the main feature of the film. Even given the superior production facilities in America at the time, no Hollywood film could have staged the battle better. It is one of the most exciting charges I've ever seen done from any country.\n\nI'm still not sure what the contrived romance between half French half Arab girl Betty Bryant and Aussie cavalryman Grant Taylor was doing here. Most of the time Betty is disguised as a boy. I'm thinking that Charles Clauvel might have seen Katharine Hepburn in Sylvia Scarlett and thought it was cute.\n\nAs one of Taylor's mates is Chips Rafferty who was THE Australian cinema star for three decades. This was the film that got him his first real notice.\n\nThough the film probably could use a modern remake in the manner of Breaker Morant and Gallipoli without the wartime propaganda and unnecessary love story tossed in, 40,000 Horseman is an exciting piece of cinema detailing the story of one of the great events in Australian history. Maybe we'll get to see it on American television soon.",

Its nice to see Chips Rafferty as the easy going Aussie bush man that made him famous. This movie was the predecessor to \"The Rats Of Tobruk\". In many ways they are both quite similar, they both talk about battles that are well known to Australians because they were both won by Australians, and they even use two of the same actors, Chips Rafferty and Grant Taylor. This movie and Rats Of Tobruk make great companions after spending ages looking for them i found copies of both them in the same shop. Both movies are very hard to find and if your a nationalist (like me) it will make you appreciate films like this a lot more so if you see a copy of this movie buy it.",

First problem is that this was made in 1940, ie during World War 2, so is first and foremost a propaganda movie. The empty patriotism and manipulation is laid on thick. The Australians are all fantastic, likable, soldiers. The Germans are all evil and inept. (Some respect is shown for the Turks, but this may be because Turkey was neutral in WW2).\n\nThen we have the random, out-of-place, lame speeches. Out of the blue some uneducated soldier from a country town starts pontificating on the meaning of life and war, etc.\n\nTo make things worse, the writers and director manage to throw in an unlikely romance (no, it doesn't involve a horse...), just to make things really silly.\n\nActing is fairly woeful, but that may be due to the script and direction.\n\nOn the plus side, the battle scenes are good and you do get a good sense of the history and bravery involved.\n\nFor a much better, more realistic and grittier depiction of the Australian Light Horse's exploits in the Sinai and Palestine in WW1, especially the Battle of Beersheba, watch \"The Lighthorsemen\" (1987) instead.

The love interest disguises herself as a boy with a high pitched voice, soft skin and breasts and fools everyone. She saves an injured soldier whose wound in the top right of his chest miraculously disappears apparently because of the wet cloth she placed on it. Three of the four leads die heroically and the best looking one gets to spend the night with the girl before winning the war and riding off into the sunset with her. Back in 1941 this no doubt would have made men cheer and women swoon, so it is best looked at as an artifact of an age of innocence. The effort expended in filming all those horses would have been huge. The Gaza and Beersheba reconstructions are fair. The acting is stagey. You just have to tolerate the jingoism and stereotypes. The Allies were fighting the Germans again when the film was released, so the propaganda motive is completely understandable.",

I find it interesting to see how children were entertained by cartoons, watching this to receive a basic idea (I have watched other cartoons to do the same, but mainly for entertainment. I found this more interesting than entertaining).\n\nI also really like the first Bugs Bunny featured, in many ways I prefer him to the Bugs we know today. I like the way he is animated and I also quite like his tricks and personality - even if it is very mean.\n\nFor what else is in the episode, I particularly like the theme of magic tricks and the white dog with black ears - very cute. **SPOILER!! SPOILER!! It is very unusual how Bugs is outwitted at the end, but personally I think he pretty much deserved it, even though I have to feel sorry for him. SPOILER OVER!! SPOILER OVER!!** \n\nAt the beginning, a pound van is chasing two stray dogs. The dogs hide behind near a house and the van drives past, not noticing the dogs are gone. The house belongs to a magician and the dogs are \"forced\" in an unusual way. Inside the house, they meet a curious rabbit who can perform amazing magic tricks...\n\nRecommended for people who are interested in the older Bugs Bunny, enjoy \"Prest-O Change-O\"!\n\nAvailable on YouTube as \"Saturday Morning Cartoons \"Prest-O Change-O\"\".",

There's a lot more style than actual substance in this short, which manages to look beautiful but it's a little too hollow to fully enjoy. What I enjoyed most was the animated work, which is extremely well done by Jones. There are many wonderful visuals including an early one where a door begins to shrink just as one of the dogs walks through but the other can't make it. The reaction to the second dog is priceless and funny as well. The rabbit here is certainly an early model for Bugs Bunny but you will clearly see that the two aren't even close.

And, like a lot of black films from the era, it somehow triumphs over those shortcomings, and is a charmer. Sadly, the DVD version I've seen was made from a print badly mauled by time, with an audio track that's sometimes indecipherable.",

                "text": "Continuing to review films featuring African-Americans in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1946 when director/actor Spencer Williams has put out another of his \"race movies\" for a black audience in segregated area theatres. Here, he plays a kindly cab driver named Joe Phillips who helps a naive country girl-and aspiring singer-named Daisy Mae Walker (Geraldine Brock) avoid the more sleazy types in New York City in order to be friends with the right show business types and living in the most friendly, if a little cheap, hotel. Despite that, there's still some unsavory types that manage to snag her though when her boyfriend, Dunbar Hamilton (R. Jore), from back home comes over, things threaten to take a violent turn...Ms. Brock's singing voice is very pleasant whether singing \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" (a song ironically used to parody the typical Negro song in films like Blazing Saddles and Revenge of the Nerds) or another song-\"Danny Boy\"-whose melody I recognized but not the lyrics. And after just seeing Williams portray a sleazy bar owner in his Go Down, Death!, it was a nice change of pace watching him here as the nicest character here. The film itself has an amateurish feel throughout especially during a fight scene when-after seeing the two men struggle-the only way you'd know how rough things are is by hearing the loud sound effects while the camera is on Williams or Ms. Brock reacting. Still, the story is good despite the contrivance of the end scene and this is a pleasant enough viewing experience for me. So on that note, I recommend The Girl in Room 20. P.S. One of the players here is one Myra D. Hemmings who's a mentor of Ms. Brock and had previously appeared in the aforementioned Go Down, Death! And the film on the DVD disc I played began with an intro narrated by Ossie Davis about The Tyler-Texas Black Film Collection which had several once-lost \"race movies\" from the '30s and '40s discovered in an abandoned warehouse there one night in August 1983 by a Dr. Gene Wiken Jones, a Southern Methodist University Professor and Director of Southwest Film Video Archives.",

Dasie Mea plans to strike it big as a singer of Gospel Music in an all-black New York Baptist Church. \n\nGetting to NYC Daisy Mea learns right away that it's not the wonderful town that she thought it was back in little Perryville Texas when she's saved from ending up working for a local Harlem madam Mamie, as one of her call-girls, by kindly and caring taxi driver Joe Phillips. This happened when Daisy Mea naively goes to the address of a friend of her parents who had long moved out. \n\nJoe getting Daisy Mea a room, room 20, at a local hotel has her fall in with the troupe of entertainers, Moody and his dancing partners Jones and Clementine, who are so impressed with Daisy's beautiful and angelic voice that she's asked by Moody to join their act at the Congo Club. Seeing her chance to make the big time Daisy Mea quickly accepts and becomes an immediate sensation as the troupe's lead singer.\n\nWith Daisy Mea not knowing any better she's approached by Arnold Richardson who tells her that as her manager he'll open up doors for her in show business that will make her a top hit not only in the world of Black Gospel Music but will get her a contract with a major record company that will expose her and her music all over the country to millions of people, black and white. What Richardson really wants is to get Daisy Mea into his and his Harlem madam's Mamie stable of call girls. Richardson who tries to make Daisy Mea think that he's in love with her is, unknown to Daisy, married and has been cheating on his old lady who if she ever finds that out would kill him. Joe finding out about Richardson's plans for Daisy Mea in a local newspaper, and knowing that he's married, call's Daisy's sweetheart back in Perryville Texas asking him to come to NYC as soon as possible before his girl, Daisy Mea, ends up in both Richerdson's and Mamie's evil clutches. \n\nMrs. Richardson finds out about her husband's infidelity at the beauty boutique when she over hears two women talking about Richarson's love life, reported in a neighborhood newspaper gossip column, and goes to his office looking to put a bullet between his eyes but Dunbar and Joe get there first. Richardson all alone with Daisy Mea tries to force himself on her but Dunbar comes to her rescue. In the middle of a knock-down and drag-out brawl an outraged Mrs. Richardson pops in, catching the creep with another women, and takes a shot at the dirty two-timing rat. Mr. Richardson being the bad shot that she is misses her husband but hits Daisy Mea instead with Richardson running for his life and disappearing out of sight never to be seen again in the movie.\n\nGetting the full support from Dunbar Joe and her friends the Moody Troupe and Daisy Meais nursed back to health. Fully recovered Daisy Mea is just about to sign a long term contract, together with the Moody dancers, when Dunbar get's a telegram telling him the amazing news that oil was struck under his grocery store and he's now a millionaire. Taking Daisy Mea back home to Perryville to get married Dunbar also invites Moody Jones and Clementine to move back home with him and Daisy Mea and live, rent free, happily ever after; You can just guess what Moody & Co, who were always broke and on the verge of getting evicted from their hotel room, answer was.",

Much of Iowa's thriving agricultural economy (even in this 1931 setting) is described with introductory visuals, before \"Career\" opens at the community's Independence Day festivities, at which Mayor Clem Bartholomew (Samuel S. Hinds) delivers his July 4th speech.\n\nWhen two town ne'er-do-wells, the drunken Mudcat (Leon Errol) and Deacon (Raymond Hatton), debate Clem's office tenure, they stumble into the shoppe of Stephen Cruthers (Edward Ellis), to seek clarification, at which time they stumble across a set of secret old letters, which advances the plot.\n\nMrs. Amy Cruthers (Janet Beecher) already knows about them but upholds her dignity. Everyone in town somehow knows about them--or learns of their ramifications somewhere along the line. But, the letters aside, Ray Cruthers (John Archer) makes his entrance from Baltimore, to the open arms of Sylvia Bartholomew (Anne Shirley), the daughter of the Mayor/Banker, who happens to have a previous engagement, with Rex Chaney (Charles Drake), to view the evening's fireworks.\n\nSylvia and her brother, Mel Bartholomew (Maurice Murphy), who rarely appear together in a scene, form an odd alliance with Ray Cruthers in spite of the fact that their fathers, Clem Bartholomew and Stephen Cruthers stand at odds over a long-running rivalry.\n\nMel Bartholomew, meanwhile, often hits the bottle, much to the dismay of his fianc\u00e9e, Merta Katz (Rowena Cook, billed as Alice Eden), the daughter of town drunk Madcat.\n\nMadcat possesses a genius to hide beneath a bushel; while he is often seen not feeling much pain, along with Deacon, he has invented an automatic gift wrapper, which Ben Burnett (Harrison Greene) operates at his restaurant/malt shoppe.\n\nWhen one of Pittsville's drunkards becomes injured in a July 4th accident, Ray Cruthers rises to the occasion.\n\nHence, as plenty of story lines and subplots are transpiring here, it is up to Ray to decide whether to continue upon his research at Johns Hopkins, or to take on a $300 per week career at a New York City hospital, which he has been offered. An undecided Ray consults his parents, as well as his intended, Sylvia.\n\nPart Two (approx. 23 minutes) commences with the narrator's discussing Thanksgiving and setting this day upon November 26th, 1931, at which point Ray returns, once again to Sylvia and her sleek wardrobe (of styles much more reminiscent of 1939 than 1931 and Park Avenue rather than Pittsville), but Anne Shirley looks really nice throughout.\n\nOn Thanksgiving night, the townsfolk wage mob scenes with a run on the bank, rumored to be closing. By now, the contents of those secret letters (from an unseen Adele) are known to all, as well as Adele's identity and her history. Stephen Cruthers firmly establishes himself as \"the voice of reason,\" as Mayor Clem Bartholomew is from now on seen in his capacity of Bank manager.\n\nThus, Sylvia, Merta and Amy are caught in alliance battles and are forced to take stands and make decisions, which may alter the outcome of civic life.\n\nPart Three (approx. 20 minutes) follows additional narrative and visuals, heralding in Christmas Eve, 1931, and Ray's third return via train to Pittsville.\n\nLittle progress has been made in-between-whiles. It would seem that shopping, banking, decision-making are reserved for the holidays here.\n\nSylvia, in long white ermine, must decide between Ray, Rex or neither, while Merta must decide on a life with or without Mel, who must decide whether or not to ease on the bottle, as must Mudcat, while Amy and Stephen face additional problems relating to the rifts with Clem and townsfolk alike.\n\nLong story short, this script by Bert Granet and Dalton Trumbo, based upon the Philip Stong novel, actually does attempt several sub-plots, which, although working well together in a sudser fashion, may cause one to ponder what \"Career\" is all about, at least in succinct fashion.\n\nBut RKO-Radio Pictures has done well in casting Anne Shirley and company, particularly Edward Ellis and Samuel S. Hinds as Pittsville patriots, as well as Janet Beecher in a truly sympathetic role.\n\nRowena Cook, John Archer, Maurice Murphy, Charles Drake, along with Miss Shirley, are effective as the youth of 1939, again set in 1931 here.\n\nAnd Leon Errol, Raymond Hatton, Harrison Greene plus Hobert Cavanaugh (as Jim Bronson, an investor) provide plausible and colorful townsfolk characters.\n\nSo, even though \"Career\" is set in southwestern Iowa in 1931 and somehow lessens its rural flavor from scene to scene, its writing rates above the average programmer, containing philosophies of liberty and justice, as well as dwelling upon the virtue of sympathy.",

Based on the celebrated 1913 horror novel of Marie Belloc Lowndes, the movie memorably captures the panic & paranoia which reigned in London during the Ripper crimes. Using the full palette of shades available to black & white cinematography, the movie creates a chilling, eerie, atmosphere in which one can walk Whitechapel's narrow streets with the murderer.\n\nLaird Cregar mesmerizes in the title role, his great, strange eyes following the viewer like those in the portraits he detests. He is the very picture of obsession & madness. Although lovely Merle Oberon & stalwart George Sanders do very well as the romantic leads, it is Cregar, his tremendous bulk moving silently through the shadows, who will remain in viewers' imaginations.\n\nAs the landlords, Sara Allgood & Sir Cedric Hardwicke are exceptional, portraying basically quiet people who come to the alarming conclusion that all is not right in their household. A\nsolid group of character actors - Queenie Leonard, Helena Pickard, Anita Sharp-Bolster, Lumsden Hare - also give vivid performances. Movie mavens will recognize uncredited turns by Billy Bevan as a bartender and, behind the mustache, little Charlie Hall, veteran of many a Laurel & Hardy comedy, as the music hall comedian whose song is interrupted by the Ripper's last attack.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of British Doris Lloyd (1896-1968), an excellent actress usually seen only in tiny bit roles, often uncredited. Here, unforgettably, she gets to deliver a short, sharp lesson in utter terror as the last of the Ripper's victims. Arriving in Hollywood during the Silent Era, Miss Lloyd would continue to grace small movie moments for decades to come.\n\nLaird Cregar is one of the great What Ifs? of American cinema. Arising out of obscurity, this young actor quickly showed a\nremarkable talent and was quite soon given featured & starring roles, of which THE LODGER is the most memorable. Alas, his star was to blink out as fast as it rose. Wishing to move into leading & romantic parts, he subjected his 300-pound frame to an extreme crash diet. His body responded with a massive heart attack, killing him only a few months after THE LODGER's release. He was 28 years old.\n\nThe film gives a somewhat fictionalized account of the depredations of Jack the Ripper, his identity & the true names of his victims being the most obvious changes. From August 7th to November 10th, 1888, a killer who would become known as Jack the Ripper horrifically butchered seven prostitutes in London's East End, committing acts of such barbaric savagery on the bodies as to be positively bestial. He was never caught, despite a huge public outcry and tremendous efforts from Scotland Yard. In the intervening years there have been numerous suggestive solutions to his identity put forward, some quite fanciful, but no proofs have ever been posited. Jack took his terrible secrets with him to the grave.",

Sadly not on video at the moment unless you dig around, but deserves to be better known than perhaps it is.  In comparison with the silent version by Hitchcock, this is more deranged and evil than Novello's cuckoo clocks and wild eyes, and also has a more logical conclusion that the viewer was sure of from early on.  The strongest scene is the one in Oberon's dressing room quite near the end, which gives the viewer as much of a fright as it gives her.  After that it is somehow reminiscent of Phantom of the Opera, not without advantage.  Well worth a look.",

                "text": "\nThe legendary true story of 19th century London's \"Jack the Ripper\" has been told countless times in TV and film.  Here, the facts are augmented into more of a character study and an observation of the perceptions and suspicions from people when confronted by a person who is decidedly \"different\".  This remake of a silent Hitchcock film focuses on the title character Cregar, an unusual, detached man who takes rooms in an affluent household at the same time that a deranged killer is carving up local \"actresses\" (1940's censorship disallowed the portrayal of what the victims were in real life -- prostitutes.)  One ironic, but unlikely, twist is that once Cregar takes the rooms, it is discovered that a prominent local actress (Oberon) is living in the home as well!  Oberon and her aunt Allgood and uncle Hardwicke become increasingly suspicious of the new lodger as he slinks out late at night, burns certain possessions of his and gets sweaty and unnerved at the mere mention of actresses.  Is he The Ripper or does he have some similarly-themed problem which will cause him to be thought of as The Ripper even though he isn't?  This is basically the thrust of the tale (stunted occasionally by some amusingly awkward musical moments from Oberon and her voice-double.)  The fog machine was working overtime during this film and it almost covers up the fact that this was filmed on a backlot.  Still, there's enough atmosphere to give the movie some sense of the time and place.  Oberon is stunning to behold in a parade of ornate gowns and hairstyles, her unique face lit well by the man she would soon marry and her graceful manner at it's peak.  Sanders has little of interest to do as a police inspector who finds time to try to woo her while the body count racks up.  As the aunt and uncle, Allgood (especially) and Hardwicke provide delightful, thoroughly solid performances.  The most memorable aspect of the film, however, is the startling performance of Cregar and the innovative ways in which he is filmed and lit.  (The camera setups, at various times, are leagues ahead of other films being done during this period.)  There is an eerie extra light on Cregar when he isn't in silhouette.  He gives such a vivid, stark performance (at times literally breathing down the viewers' necks!) that, once seen, he is unlikely to be forgotten.  Fortunately, at 84 minutes, the film doesn't overstay its welcome and provides a nice bit of creepy entertainment.  Even at this length there are some slightly unnecessary and dull interludes among the townsfolk, but for the most part, the film works.  Though the violence is, by now, so tame as to be nonexistent, the menace of the killer is still effective and occasionally very creepy.  (Some modern slasher films like 1981's \"The Fan\" drew obvious inspiration from this one.)  Cregar, who died of a heart attack after quickly shedding 100 pounds in order to change his image, is an actor whose screen presence ran circles around many of his contemporaries.  That he died so young (he was 28 years old in this film!) and before seeing his full potential realized is one of Hollywood's great losses. \n",

                "text": "\nIt began, possibly in April 1888 when a woman named Emma Smith died after being stabbed multiple times - possibly by a gang.  Smith may have been a prostitute.  But it really got underway in August of that year, when a prostitute named Mary Ann Nichols was killed in the East End of London.  She was followed by Annie Chapman, Catherine Eddowes, Elizabeth Stride, and finally (and most horribly) Mary Jane Kelly,who was butchered (literally) by the killer in her room in November.  After that, although several later killings were sometimes ascribed to the killer, the murders ceased.  Nothing in this case has been universally accepted, and every \"clue\" has been analyzed or reanalyzed again and again.  There are a myriad of suggested suspects, including the Duke of Clarence (Queen Victoria's heir and grandson), Dr. Sir William Gull, Montague John Druitt, Michael Ostrog, Aaron Kosminski, four murderers: Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, George Chapman, Frederick Deeming, William Bury, Dr. Tumblety,murder victim James Maybrick, Roylston D'Onston Stevenson, painter Walter Sickert, and (believe it or not) Lewis Carroll (most Ripperologists reject the Carroll theory).  One unnamed suspect is known as the \"Lodger\".  The story first occurred as a rumour passed around in the early years of the century (one of those who passed it around is Walter Sickert).  The story is that a young man (who was secretive, but sickly) was living in a London boarding house.  He only left at night, but would return before daylight.  His sole interest was in the newspaper reports of the murders (which occurred only at night).  After the murder of Mary Kelly the young man has a collapse in his precarious health, and dies a few months later.  From this rumour Marie Belloc Lowndes (sister of Hilliare Belloc and writer of novels based on true crimes) wrote her short story \"The Lodger.\"  Later she turned it into a longer novella.  This is the story that is the basis for the 1944 film (as well as other versions, such as Hitchcock's 1927 version).           This film and it's follow-up are the capoffs for Laird fine, brief career of movie stardom.  He had played villains and psychotics in other films (THIS GUN FOR HIRE, I WAKE UP SCREAMING) and demonstrated  a versatility seldom shown by some of the popular leading men he supported at the time.  He also had done other costume films (he is Sir Henry Morgan, the buccaneer turned royal governor in THE BLACK SWAN, and was the art dealer in Monty Wooley/Gracie Field's HOLY MATRIMONY). His work in comedy and melodrama, modern and costume pieces came together in THE LODGER and HANGOVER SQUARE.  In both we know he is the killer, and yet in both we find an odd sympathy for his characters. Perhaps more for George Bone in the latter film (who really is not sure what is going on, but knows it is dreadful), but here there is a sense of loss - the Lodger's brother was destroyed by a prostitute (here called an \"actress\"), which has led to his crusade of destruction.           The supporting cast is fine too, with George Sanders playing the suspicious Scotland Yard inspector who unmasks Cregar (using fingerprinting - which was not used in Great Britain until 1905).  Despite the anachronism it is a handsome piece of well made melodrama.  One watches it and HANGOVER SQUARE and shakes one's head at the loss the movies had when Cregar died later in 1944. ",

(She's the author of another effective Victorian melodrama that starred Joan Fontaine in the title role as IVY ('47). Mr. Ballard also does a masterful job in photographing MERLE OBERON who never looked more exquisite than she does here in her role as a music hall dancer/singer. (It must be noted that she appears more than a little uneasy in the bawdy musical numbers but performs her acting chores competently).\n\nLAIRD CREGAR gives one of his most menacing performances as the lodger who roams London late at night with what appears to be a black medical kit. The suspense lies in how and where he will be caught and whether or not he will be successful in killing Miss Oberon who inspires his wrath because it is women like her that led to his brother's downfall.\n\nTHE LODGER never falters in presenting a compelling fictionalized account of what some believe may be the real story behind the killings that baffled Scotland Yard so many years ago. His bulky image hovers over the film with chilling menace even in scenes where he is not present.\n\n\nOn the other hand, GEORGE SANDERS is wasted in an underwritten role as an inspector determined to find the killer. The wonderful SARAH ALLGOOD is splendid in a good supporting role as the woman who gives the lodger shelter.\n\nUnder John Brahm's superb direction, THE LODGER is a film that keeps you in its grip from beginning to end, largely due to Cregar's outstanding performance in the title role and the excellent recreation of Victorian London and its gaslit atmosphere.\n\nHugo Friedhofer's interesting background score gives added dimension to the proceedings. For another glimpse of LAIRD CREGAR at his best, check out HANGOVER SQUARE, Cregar's last film in 1945 and also directed by John Brahm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This part of London is cloaked in fog, the cobbled streets damp and bearing witness to unspeakable crimes, the gas lights dimly flicker as the British Bobby searches in vain for Bloody Jack.\n\nThe scene is set for what is to me the finest adaptation to deal with the notorious murderer, Jack the Ripper. A remake of the Alfred Hitchcock silent from 1927, this adaptation of the Marie Belloc Lowndes novel not only looks great (Lucien Ballard's photography creating fluid eeriness and film noir fatalism) but also chills the blood without ever actually spilling any. It's a testament to John Brahm's direction that the film constantly feels like a coiled spring waiting to explode, a spring that is realised in the form of Laird Cregar's incredibly unnerving portrayal of Mr Slade.\n\nLaird Cregar, as evidenced here, was a fine actor in the making. Sadly troubled by his weight and yearning to become a true matin\u00e9e idol, he crashed dieted to such a degree his poor 28 year old heart couldn't cope with the shock. After just 16 films, of which this was his second to last, the movie world was robbed of a truly fine performer, a sad story in a long line of sad incidents that taint the Hollywood story.\n\nGeorge Sanders and Merle Oberon (as police inspector and Slade's infatuation respectively) engage in a less than fully realised romantic strand, and Cedric Hardwicke dominates all the scenes that don't feature the might of Cregar, but really it's the big man's show all the way. Creepily enhanced by Hugo Friedhofer's score, The Lodger is a lesson in how to utilise technical atmospherics.\n\nThe moody atmosphere here hangs heavy and the sense of doom is palpable in the extreme, it comes as something of a relief when the ending finally comes, as it's time to reflect and exhale a sigh of relief. Deviating from the novel, something which has over the years annoyed purists, The Lodger shows its hand very much from the off, but it in no way hurts the picture, if anything the exasperation at the supporting characters induces dry humour. The kind that comes in the form of nervous giggles out there in the dark, but rest assured, this is no comedy, it's a creepy classic from a wonderful era of film making. 9/10",

John Brahm's movie opens on the gas-lit and fog-wreathed cobblestones, evocatively shot by Lucien Ballard, in this umpteenth recension of Marie Belloc Lowndes' evergreen chiller The Lodger (Alfred Hitchcock did a silent treatment in 1927, and Jack Palance would star in Man in the Attic in 1954 , to name but two of its closest cousins).\n\nThe crafty Mrs. Lowndes may have been the first to use that surefire scare tactic `the call is coming from inside the house!'  The gimmick of her story is that the fiend has a respectable face and may have taken lodgings under a respectable roof  while its respectable occupants remain oblivious but imperiled. \n\nBrahm's choice of lodger is Laird Cregar, whose enormous bulk \u0096 he was six-three and 300 pounds \u0096 made him look perpetually 45, though he was only 28 when he died, shortly after making this movie. (His last, released posthumously the following year, was the somewhat similar Hangover Square, which Brahm also directed).  The rooms he takes (including an attic `laboratory' complete with gas fire for his experiments) belong to Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood, whose niece Merle Oberon, a music-hall star, lives there as well. \n\nWhen Laird is invited to attend one of Oberon's can-can numbers, he rants and raves about painted and powdered woman and finally erupts: `I can show you something more beautiful than a beautiful woman,' whereupon he produces a photograph of his dead brother, who came to ruin through consorting with wicked women (there's the merest insinuation of syphilitic insanity).  Clearly, the lodger has unresolved issues.\n\nThe Ripper legend and Lowndes' telling of it are so familiar it needs no retracing, save to note that George Sanders plays the smitten Scotland Yard Detective and that Brahm delivers all the expected chills.  But then this German emigrant always fared better with the spooky and the Victorian than with the hard-boiled and American.  The Lodger counts among his finer hours-and-a-half.",

And, oddly enough, Price did the radio program version of The Lodger after this film was released. Cregar is not your typical leading man. He's about 6'3 and 300lbs. I haven't been able to find out a lot about him, but I had heard he was a homosexual. This all comes together rather interestingly because the character he plays, Mr. Slade, has a rather strange if somewhat vague sexual attraction to his now deceased brother. Pretty racy stuff for 1944! But, to add to this, one of the main suspects in the real Jack the Ripper killings is Francis Tumblety, who had a well-known hatred for women and I believe was arrested for doing some nasty things with the fellows in or near Whitechapel around the time of the Ripper's nightly jaunts. Curiouser and curiouser! \n\nSome liberties had to be taken with the plot, due to the fact that censors didn't want the word \"prostitute\" flowing off the tongues of the actors. So, Jack has an issue with dancehall girls and actresses(this is 1888, so, not film actresses) and believes they caused the downfall of his brother. Therefore, Jack must hack! Unfortunately, you only get to see his knife at the very end of the movie, but Cregar makes up for it with his tour de force acting and the cinematography is superb. Several scenes stand out, most of them with Cregar, such as when he's been injured and is prowling the catwalks, holding his injured neck, and bars of light flash over his face as he moves towards the camera. Or when he's cornered by the brilliant George Sanders and half of Scotland Yard in one of the upper levels of the theater house, his knife finally out and ready for action--Cregar's bulging eyes stare down his hunters like a beast at bay with the only soundtrack being his labored breathing after his body has been pumped full of several bullets(another thing I liked--he didn't just drop over dead after one shot).\n\nThe only thing that this movie lacked was more scenes between Cregar and Sanders. That would have made this a 10/10 for me as these two are some of my favorite actors of the time. Cregar is shy, sensitive, and refined as the eccentric Mr. Slade, a mysterious \"pathologist\" who comes to a residence seeking lodgings for his work. He's taken in by an older couple who also have a young maid and a niece living at the home. Mr. Slade keeps rather odd hours, you see, and he doesn't do a very good job of covering up his work. You will have to overlook the fact that 1940's cinema probably knew nothing about the forensics of murder or blood-splatter, etc. It would be a foolish thing for a serial killer to take up lodging with a family when he could be spotted at any time with bloody clothes(and given the nature of his work, VERY bloody). Merle Oberon is the naive Kitty, the niece of the older couple, and her profession and her beauty create a great conflict in Mr. Slade. On one hand, he finds her very attractive, but on the other, he remembers what sort of females did his brother in and that means Slade might have to do a little carving on her.\n\nYou really do want to give Slade the benefit of the doubt, and the entire time up until the end, I was suspecting that they were totally wrong about him and that his eccentric behavior was meant to throw the viewer off the track. He's a very sympathetic character, even though he wants to have sex with his brother and kills women about once a week(cast the first stone, as they say), and Cregar's performance is probably the best of his career, not to mention the fact he created one of the best villains of all time--sadly probably not as well known as it should be.\n\nThis is mandatory viewing for you.

Not to mention it's influence on police procedurals (there's a scene at Scotland Yard's Black Museum) and later Ripper films such as \"From Hell\".\n\nBut what makes this version special is that it features strong performances by Laird Cregar as the creepy Mr. Slade, and Merle Oberon as a can-can dancer who comes and goes through the East End at night, just the sort of girl who might fall prey to someone like The Ripper.\n\nFurthermore, this film came out when the film noir style was in full swing, and cinematographers were experimenting with new camera angles and especially the use of low key lighting. Whether or not it can be classified as a bona fide noir or not, it certain shows noir influences, with figures frequently silhouetted in the London fog, and a distinct similarity to the \"menaced woman\" noir sub-genre typified by films such as \"Sorry, Wrong Number\".",

As 20th Century Fox often did, they remade this A film as a B film in the '50s as \"Man in the Attic\" starring Jack Palance. My recollection is that the film followed \"The Lodger\" frame for frame and word for word. \"Man in the Attic\" is very good; however, \"The Lodger\" is superior.\n\nThis is the oft-told story of a strange man who claims to be a pathologist taking rooms in a private home in Victorian England. The lady of the house begins to suspect he's Jack the Ripper. Her husband, although fascinated by the case, thinks she's mistaken. Also staying in the house with them is the wife's niece, Lily, a performer who has brought her dance troupe to work in London. When Scotland Yard comes a-calling to question her about a murdered woman who visited her at the theater, there is an instant attraction between her and the inspector in charge of the case.\n\nAlthough a tall and large-framed man, Cregar came off initially as less frightening than the austere-looking Palance, although both used very gentle voices in the role. He's fantastic as Slade, his violence hidden in a lumbering frame and a soft, slow demeanor. One wonders what would have happened to his career had he lived - it probably would have been tremendous. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 30 as a result of crash dieting. Merle Oberon is radiantly beautiful, lively, and flirtatious as Lily, and Sanders is handsome and effective in the role of the inspector, though he doesn't have much to do. Sara Allgood is excellent as the suspicious Helen, and Cedric Hardwicke appropriately gruff as her husband.\n\nThe atmosphere is as thick as the fog in \"The Lodger,\" and the ending is remarkable with its use of unusual lighting and camera angles. This is a marvelous film, all the better for the performance of Laird Cregar, whose career and life ended much too soon.",

Save for their career designation as given in the dialogue, the film is clearly suggesting prostitutes as victims, and the killer is shown to find showgirls immoral. (It is also important to note the great pains made by the script to show the victims as kind and generous and in no way deserving of their fate.)\n\nIn any event this is a well-made film with excellent black and white photography, good camera work and some interesting images. The film is foremost entertainment, it is not a detailed documentary of the \"Jack the Ripper\" crimes, nor is it a mystery. Only a rudimentary exploration of the killer's psyche is made, and much screen-time is lavished on showcasing song and dance numbers performed by Merle Oberon in her leading role as a gaily dressed showgirl.

The acting is excellent, down to the smallest roles, and the look of the film feels just right, between art direction and cinematography. The ominous score by Hugo Friedhofer adds much to the grim atmosphere. But it is Laird Cregar who dominates the film from his first appearance. His melancholy , soft spoken Mr. Slade ranges from a low key, shy manner to a sudden mania ,with total believability. The most fascinating aspect of the film is the surprisingly strong sexual undercurrents in the scenes between Cregar and Merle Oberon.

We're allowed to see things through his eyes. Especially at the end, when he's cornered by the crowd, when he looks so demented to the crowd, we see the crowd from his perspective. They must look so frightening to him.\n\nOne quick note: Sara Allgood also was in \"How Green was My Valley,\" and she deserves some recognition for her great part in \"The Lodger\" and her prolific career. She was an actress who worked without much fanfare, but always gave great performances.\n\nSee this version of \"The Lodger\" and don't be taken in or fooled by imitations.

Women are dying heinously, slit by a blade from a man spotted carrying a specific type of black bag and it's noticed by Ellen(Sara Allgood)that Slade is burning his in the attic. Slade goes out at late hours claiming that he enjoys the lonely streets, while also proclaiming that he uses the attic for \"experiments.\" When Ellen goes to husband Robert(Cedric Hardwicke)about her feelings regarding Slade, he shrugs her off as being foolish. Soon Kitty and Ellen begin listening and getting closer to Slade, who speaks coldly and articulately about things regarding women and their roles in London society.

Meanwhile Scotland Yard Inspector John Warwick(George Sanders)is out looking for the Ripper and along the way falls in love with Kitty as they hint about Slade's unusual activities and behavior. Soon, the Ripper continues to strike and Kitty notices Slade burning bloody clothes in the attic which raises her suspicions to a fever pitch. Slade begins taking an obsessive fancy to Kitty and this sets off an amazing finale in her theater as police and John chase after the Ripper in a stunning climax explaining what they perceive, artistically happened to the White Chapel psycho.\n\nSound remake of Hitchcock silent is impeccably atmospheric with amazing realistic sets..London, at that time when Jack spread his reign of terror, is incredibly recreated with the eerily photographed foggy London streets.

She hears from Slade himself and notices his strange behavior and just the way he talks gives out signs that he's both incredibly intelligent and deeply disturbed. The film even hints, that Slade's possibly homosexual. Laird Cregar's chilling performance, as the camera often closes in to capture his brooding, cold-blooded menace with this living, breathing, seething undercurrent of madness that needs to be released at night against women who represent an object of hate for him to target, is a wonder to behold. This could be the finest interpretation of who Jack the Ripper was and how he behaved. You have the always-reliable Sanders smooth as the Inspector searching for the killer, a sophisticated intellectual and perfect nemesis of an equally intelligent street stalker that has evade capture. Oberon has that charming grace that one expects from such a talented actress..you can see why Jack would become enamored with such a beautiful creature.

                "text": "Everybody in this world loves enigmas\u0085 The best example to prove this remains the unsolved mystery surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders in London at the end of the 19th century. For more than 125 years now, Jack the Ripper has been the source of inspiration for numerous of films, TV-shows, documentaries and novels. Whether based on facts or purely fictionalized, the notorious serial killer continuously remained a relevant and popular horror/thriller protagonist. In 1913, Marie Belloc-Lowndes wrote her novel \"The Lodger\" and even though her story was mainly pure fiction, the book nevertheless became one of the most prominent Jack the Ripper sagas and got adapted into at least five film scenarios already. In 1927 the book formed the inspiration for none other than Alfred Hitchcock's first steps in the cinema industry with \"The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog\", and in 1953 the booked help launching Jack Palance's film career with \"Man in the Attic\". The personal favorite version of yours truly, however, is the stunningly atmospheric and compelling 1944 version directed by the German immigrant director John Brahm and starring the charismatic Laird Cregar as the suspicious and overly introvert lodger Mr. Slade who may or may not be maniac responsible for the gruesome Ripper murders in Whitechapel. \n\nAlmost every aspect about \"The Lodger\" is impeccable and everyone's contribution is equally important. Belloc-Lowndes' source novel narrates the story from a different and fascinating angle. While the entire city of London lives in fear because of the gruesome murders of actresses and/or showgirls, Robert and Ellen Bonting receive a new lodger for their extra room and attic in the shape of the courteous but somewhat distant Mr. Slade. He warns them that he often has to go out during the night and that he uses the attic to conduct medical experiments, but the elderly couple still attempts to connect with him. When Mr. Slade meets their lovely niece Kitty, he increasingly grows fond of her even though she's a stage actress \u0085 And Mr. Slade firmly believes that all stage actresses are putrid and on a mission to disrupt the lives of noble gentlemen! As stated above, everyone in this production contributed to the success of the film! Director John Brahm is of German descent, and thus he clearly brought the beautiful influences of silent expressionist masterpieces with him. Cinematographer Lucien Ballard stuffs the film with countless of grandiose camera angles and manages to make the fogbound city look even more menacing than she already is. The supportive cast includes a handful of fantastic names and they each deliver great performances, like George Sanders (\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\") as the intelligent constable, Merle Oberon (\"Wuthering Heights\") as the naive but beautiful and sweet object of obsession and Sir Cedric Hardwicke as the ranting newspaper-addicted estate owner. However, they all remain in the shadow \u0096 pun intended \u0096 of Laird Cregar who depicts his character so good that it's nearly indescribable! Mr. Slade is menacing and simultaneously pitiable, sophisticated as well as primitive and generally speaking just overwhelming to observe! According to news articles that I've read, Cregar struggled with many complexes, regarding his appearance as well as his homosexuality, and the disunity of his own persona definitely reflects here on screen. He wanted to avoid further typecasting and thus went on an extreme and unsupervised diet which cost him his life at the tragically young age of 28. \"The Lodger\" and another magnificent collaboration with John Brahm called \"Hangover Square\" were the final achievements of an actor that easily could have become legendary if only he had lived a little bit longer\u0085 \n\nAnd, last but not least, another powerful contributor to the success of \"The Lodger\" is definitely its time of release! The aforementioned Hitchcock adaptation perhaps came too soon and \"Man in the Attic\" perhaps came too late, but this version got released during a footnote revolution in the horror movie industry. In the 1930s, Universal dominated the horror business with their grotesque monsters like mummies, werewolves, vampires and Frankenstein creatures. In the early 1940s, on the other hand, producer Val Lewton and RKO Pictures started making eerie and atmospheric horror movies that gave human faces to the monsters. Suddenly evil didn't have fangs or fur anymore, but instead it had penetrating dark eyes and wore stylish suits. Cregar's Mr. Slade perfectly belongs in this horror evolution and easily ranks as one of the most memorable creeps of the decade. Admittedly \"The Lodger\" also has a few defaults. Mr. Slade often behaves a bit too suspiciously and nervous even though Jack the Ripper is supposed to be cold-blooded and professional, while the naivety of Kitty and the ignorance of Robert Bonting are exaggeratedly implausible. Still, it's a tremendously brilliant film from start to finish, with a breathtaking finale to boot!",

This was my first view of him in any film and he managed to maintain a looming menace throughout the picture. There's no doubt he would have left a significant mark in film if he hadn't died tragically at an early age. He reminded me a bit of Orson Welles in size and girth, and if you study him closely, there's a similarity in facial appearance as well. Just take a look at the \"Heaven Can Wait\" photo of him posted on his character page here on IMDb. He looks more like the devil than the devil himself, if you get my drift, really creepy.\n\nThat creepiness factor is used to good advantage throughout the movie, as Slade carries on a surreptitious presence at the Bonting home along with his mysterious forays into the night under the guise of a pathology student. His ideas about 'beauty is evil' and 'evil is beauty' seemed somewhat convoluted to this viewer, but I took that as in keeping with a tormented mind trying to deal with the anguish over his loss of a brother.

It's not the easiest task, but here they do it quite well (in that sense it reminded me a bit of Alfred Hitchcock's \"I Confess\").\n\nSometimes this film gets labeled as a \"horror\" film, but it should be classed as a \"suspense film\". Hitchcock directed a silent version of the tale, but not this rendition...although it might remind many viewers of a Hitchcock flick. The director here -- John Brahm -- had a rather checkered career that included some brilliant \"Twilight Zone\" episodes, but also the horrible Dana Andrews/Jeanne Crain film \"Hot Rods From Hell\". This film may have been his apex.\n\nThe casting here is quite good. It's a different kind of role for the lovely Merle Oberon, here as a French-style can-can dancer. She does well and makes a perfect victim, and her hair style is great because it covers her very high forehead. But Laird Cregar -- as Jack The Ripper -- is the real star here...he is \"the lodger\". Cregar died from an excessive diet that he took for the film following this one; he was only 31. For once, George Sanders is the good guy -- a Scotland Yard inspector, and the love interest for Merle Oberon.

Who's wondering most of all is Scotland Yard Inspector George Sanders.\n\nThe Buntings, Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood, think nothing of him at first, but his attentions to their actress daughter Merle Oberon are creeping them out. Not to mention the unease that she is slowly feeling around Cregar.\n\nDirector John Brahm got some great performances out of his cast and really caught the mood of Victorian London. But Cregar will arouse all kinds of conflicting emotions in you. You will hate, loath, and pity him all at once, not an easy thing for an actor to maintain, but Cregar pulls it off. \n\nThe Lodger is a remake of a film young Alfred Hitchcock did as a silent. They're both good, but I give the edge to this one.",

He came up with a gem of a period piece, and you can look 'til your eyes drop out, you won't find anything out of place - (oh,alright,the anachronism mentioned on the title page) - he even had wick holders at the foot of the staircase, this being the 1880's before electricity. Surprisingly good production values for a movie in this genre.\n\nLaird Cregar is genuinely creepy (see humorous headline), as well as big. He puts the show over and is aided by George Sanders in a good guy role for a change and minus his usual smirk. Merle Oberon is lovely and sings, or at least lip-synchs some songs. I think one mark of a good production is often the quality of the supporting cast, and there is nothing lacking here - Cedric Hardwicke, Sarah Allgood, Queenie Leonard all give it their best.\n\nDirector Brahm created a tense, atmospheric feel that is sustained and the picture is well-paced without dead spots in its 84 minute run. This is a good movie and minus the schlock that usually accompanies pictures of this type. It was on Fox Movie Channel the other morning and it is well worth your time.",

Mayer's strait-jacketing insistence on \"wholesome entertainment\". Here Fox comes up with a luridly lavish production recreating 19th century London in great period detail, from glistening cobblestone streets to lush theatre interior. And who better to direct the deepening shadows and smouldering desires than baroque stylist John Brahm.\n\nAnd of course there's also London's most famous denizen, Jack the Ripper. Who else would be prowling these Gothic byways looking to rid the city of \"painted women\". As the Ripper, Laird Cregar is all shambling bulk, rolling eyeballs, and epicene madness. And when he starts simpering about his beloved brother, ruined by evil women, we know he's not just mad, but kinky too. Scope out that lumpy crawl along the catwalk at movie's end. I've never seen facial features twisted so grotesquely and without aid of make-up. Then too, watch him come slowly unglued as he ogles Kitty's painted stage girls, attracted and repulsed at the same time. What a great florid actor. Too bad he died so soon. \n\nGeorge Sanders has something of a secondary role as an amorous inspector from Scotland Yard. Obviously, the Yard didn't train its men in how to woo women, since Sanders' idea of enticing Oberon is having her paw over real death masks and authentic murder weapons-- how can she possibly resist. Also, his line about insisting on another date is a little gem of sneaky drollery. My one reservation is Oberon. She's clearly doing a \"star's turn\" that's out of sync with the rest of the film. No doubt, Fox was looking for a marquee name since Cregar is not exactly a Photoplay pin-up. But that name came at a cost to what is otherwise a solid piece of baroque movie-making.",

As the murders continue, Slade comes under the suspicion of all who encounter him. The Lodger is not a film to be watched if you're looking for historical accuracy, Ripper aficionados will probably baulk and get quite uppity with the amount of liberties taken, but then this particular tale has taken on a life of its own and has rarely been given its historical dues on film. The film is awash with street urchins with suspiciously \"la di da\" accents always willing to greet a passer by with a \"Morning Guvnor!\", in fact The Lodger reminded me of the Universal Sherlock Holmes films, from their slightly bogus \"Hollywood London\" look, right down to their bawdy tavern songs and foggy streets.

                "text": "In this story Laird Cragar goes flapping around a Whitechapel theater in his ulster, a crazed and overweight Batman, trying desperately to murder the delicious stage star Merle Oberon. This is one of those movies made under the Code. All of the Ripper's victims were \"stage girls,\" instead of the drunken prostitutes they actually were. It's very rude of him to want to \"cut out the evil\" in somebody who is as stunning as Merle Oberon, even if her talent as an actress was moderate. No normal man would want to do more than pinch her a little.\n\nThe story of the Ripper is so familiar that it's not worth describing in detail -- and in fact the movie doesn't describe it in detail, concentrating instead of the mysterious comings and goings of Laird Cragar as the new upstairs lodger of the title. Craigar has the part down pat. He's unusually tall and, white not especially rotund, has flabby features that seem made of play-do. Every move he makes, every enigmatic utterance, invites suspicion.\n\nHe shows up at the house of Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood and their niece, Oberon, on the night of one of the murders, carrying nothing but a black bag. When the papers reveal that the Ripper was seen carrying such a bag, Craigar burns his, causing an acrid smoke to fill the hallway. If the murderer is seen wearing an ulster, Craigar burns his. If the Ripper appears to have some medical knowledge, Craigar is found to be a sometime pathologist. His flat is decorated with photos of \"old-time actresses\" that he turns to the wall. \"Did you ever notice,\" he remarks to Allgood, \"that when you walk around the room the eyes seem to follow you?\" The suspense is enhanced immeasurably by John Brahm's direction and the noir-like lighting of Lucien Ballard. In his first attempt to confront Oberon alone in her room, Brahm frames her between the bulk of Craigar's body and his arm, emphasizing her fragility and the overall sense of her entrapment.\n\nIn a later scene, the wounded Craigar is crawling along a catwalk high above the stage and the bars of light flicker rapidly over his face as he crawls along the steel bars of the floor, like strobes, like some demonic light bulb that has decided to trip out. The film is fine at evoking the smoggy, cobbled streets and gin mills of 1875 London too, though the effect is more stylized than realistic. (Realistically, Whitechapel was a pig style and smelled like one.) Marvelous job.\n\nThe film was remade almost shot for shot nine years later with Jack Palance as the eponymous lodger. Palance brings a different kind of menace to the role, that of the coiled spring, while Craigar is so constructed that he seems able to murder a tiny woman simply by falling on her and smothering her.\n\nThe \"dance hall girls\" business is always a little bothersome. Why did these women go out after dark when the entire city was in turmoil because of the murders? Well, unlike dance hall girls, the real victims had no choice. Many were homeless, abject drunks, who hoped to make enough money from some impromptu engagement to spend a night in a flop house and, with any luck, to buy enough gin to get soused. The cheaper houses rented not beds but chairs, lined up in a row, with a rope across the front for the consumer to lean on while sleeping. They weren't killed because they sang and danced. They were slaughtered because they were available.\n\nAnyway, this film is probably better than the Jack Palance version and, though the story is cleaned up, it's quite good. Craigar makes a fine menacing figure. George Sanders has the uninteresting role of the Scotland Yard detective. (None of the political shenanigans are gone into.) And Merle Oberon is exquisite.",

Interiors consist of high ceilings and gaslights, which create the same creepy effect. Most of the plot takes place at night. Darkness is played for all it's worth.\n\nIn addition to effective lighting, I also liked the performances of Cedric Hardwicke and the very matronly Sara Allgood, who play a mature couple that rents out part of their big house to a lodger: a polite, shy, soft-spoken man with big mournful eyes, named Slade (Laird Cregar). He's big, tall, and very mysterious. Is this Mr. Slade the infamous Jack The Ripper?\n\nAlthough the lighting and some of the acting are quite effective, I do have reservations about this film.\n\nThe plot is repetitive: a sequence begins with the setup for a woman being killed, then her off-screen murder, followed by suspicion and talk among the townsfolk, and Slade's mysterious activities. The cycle then repeats. There is a lot of filler in the script. The entire story could have been told in thirty minutes. Further, I found the story's ending a tad disappointing.\n\nThe film's score to some extent dilutes suspense created by the creepy lighting. Not having any score would have amplified the overall sense of terror. Similarly, a couple of Fox musical numbers seriously intrude. They bring the plot to a screeching halt. And, they drain away the tension that had been building.\n\nMost of the casting and acting are fine. But Laird Cregar comes across as stiff and wooden. His in-your-face prominence is overdone.

It's difficult to compare this film to the original as they're fundamentally very different; owing to the fact, of course, that the original was a silent picture and this one has sound. I will, however, say that Alfred Hitchcock's film is the more effective telling of the story and this one has a number of problems, mostly owing to the characters central to the story. The plot is very simple. The scene is set in London during the time of Jack the Ripper. Around the time he's tearing his way through the women of the city, a landlady and landlord have taken in a lodger named Mr Slade. He's a very strange man; a sinister misdemeanour and the fact that he likes to go out walking for seemingly no reason in the middle of the night being just the tip of the iceberg. Naturally, it's not long before Mr Slade's behaviour is likened to Jack the Ripper and his landlady begins to suspect that he's the killer.\n\nAll the main characters in this film are far too over the top. Laird Cregar takes the role of the lodger; and while it's undoubtedly a commanding and captivating performance, he's simply too sinister and weird, (not to mention not very good at covering his tracks) and wouldn't have been more suspect if he actually had \"Jack the Ripper\" tattooed on his forehead. By contrast, his landlords; played by Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood are two of the slowest individuals to grace cinema. Sure they get an inkling of their lodger's true identity fairly early on; but it takes them a long time to come to an all too obvious conclusion. All this stuff really brought the film down for me; but rating purely in terms of cinema, The Lodger fares a little better. Director John Brahm expertly captures the underbelly of London and the film has a really great atmosphere. Naturally, the film is not graphic; but we do get treated to a few unsettling murder scenes also. Overall, I do have to say that I enjoyed this film in spite of my problems with the characters and would rate it as worth seeing.",

                "text": "A classic woman's film in the best sense of the word, \"Old Acquaintance\" was remade by George Cukor as \"Rich and Famous\" and echoed in the final scenes of Pedro Almodovar's \"La Flor de Mi Secreto.\" Such is the enduring appeal of this tale of a friendship between two women that continues throughout their lives despite rivalries, temperament, and love affairs. Of course with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as the women, the film rises from melodramatic soap opera to a higher level. Davis plays Kit, a serious, sensitive writer, whose interests lie principally in her work. Hopkins plays Millie, a self-absorbed woman who envies her friend's success, but is determined to have everything: a writing career, a home, and a family. While Kit writes critically lauded books and plays, Millie produces a steady stream of best selling romantic novels. While Millie becomes wealthy beyond measure, Kit remains appreciated if not rich. However, Kit's warmth attracts the affections of not only Millie's increasingly estranged husband, but also her neglected daughter.\n\nThus, the stage is set for emotional clashes between the two writers that provide Davis and Hopkins with some juicy material. Hopkins in particular chews the scenery, wrings her hands, and emotes outrageously. Davis, on the other hand, underplays her role more than usual, although the Davis eyes and inflections remain. Perhaps she understood that the histrionics of more than one actress would be too much for the audience to bear. However, during one classic outburst, Davis unexpectedly does steal a scene from Hopkins and provoke a startled laugh from the audience. With two strong women at its center, the men in \"Old Acquaintance\" understandably play support. John Loder is all bland good looks as Millie's husband, and a handsome Gig Young does little besides look handsome and play the too-young romantic interest for Davis.\n\nWith the exception of Deidre, Hopkins' daughter, the other major female roles also involve working women. Although Davis's maid may be a domestic, she does work and earn her own living. The reporter who interviews Hopkins and Loder is a gender-neutral role, but perhaps to emphasize the centrality of women to the story, another strong actress, Anne Revere, was cast. In fact, besides Loder and Young, most of the men in the film play waiters, taxi drivers, night clerks, playboys, and drunks. Newcomer Dolores Moran, who plays Deidre, was out of her league with Davis and Hopkins and comes across as shallow and unconvincing. Her erotic gyrations to seduce Gig Young in a listening booth and her defiant dalliance with an older playboy are at odds with the character and image of Kit, who was supposedly Deidre's role model.\n\nFast paced, lush, and romantic, \"Old Acquaintance\" is one of those movies that \"they just don't make anymore.\" The dialog is delicious, the performances occasionally border on camp, and the direction is sure-handed. With a box of chocolates, a wad of Kleenex, and a bottle of flat champagne, Bette and Miriam are the perfect friends for a rainy afternoon.",

This one is a real dandy. Davis is her inimitably intense self, and she's matched all the way by the great Miriam Hopkins who was at her peak on-screen in the '30's. While this is often referred to as Davis' picture, Miriam holds her own. These ladies are truly two of the finest actresses to ever grace the Hollywood screen and deliver Oscar-caliber performances. The confrontation scene where Davis shakes the living daylights out of Hopkins is a high example of art imitating life because Davis and Hopkins weren't exactly the best of friends in real-life either.

                "text": "Long before \"Beaches\" and \"The Turning Point\", there was the film \"Old Acquaintance\" (1937?). Focusing on the familiar theme of longtime friendship that is tainted by jealousy and competition, one of the most remarkable things about it is that Davis actually plays the \"nice\" one this time around. \"Old Acquaintance\" begins with Kit (Davis), a writer who turns out books that appeal to female intellectuals, returns home to visit her old friend Millie (Hopkins). Kit and Millie basically grew up together, and despite Kit's seriousness and drive and Millie's concern for all things material, the two have forged a friendship that is pretty tight. When we first meet the two, Millie, married and pregnant with her first (and only) child, decides that she too can become an authoress, only she is going to write what she thinks the public wants; torrid potboilers (ala Danielle Steel) that are high on the sappy melodrama, and low on the substance meter. When Millie finds eventual success and becomes extremely wealthy, churning out book after book, her husband Pres (Loder), and child, Didi begin to feel neglected and eschewed, thanks to Millie's highly materialistic and \"queen bee\" attitude. They both turn to Kit, who has managed to stick around through all of this, Pres falling in love with her, and Didi looking to Kit as a surrogate mother. Despite Kit having reciprocal feelings for Pres, she insists that they can never come to fruition since Millie is her best friend, so he divorces Millie and leaves. Years later, still a success, Millie finds out that Kit and Pres were in love at one point, and despite the fact that neither followed through with their feelings, Millie blames Kit, now an accomplished and respected playwright, eventually turning Didi, now in her late teens, against her. The drama is further heightened when Kit finally agrees to marry Rudd (Young), her younger lover, right when he meets and falls in love with Didi, causing further conflict and heartache until Kit and Millie are left with the prospect of only being left with the other, despite their serious issues over the years.\n\nI really enjoyed \"Old Acquaintance\" because it had all of the elements of a great melodrama; back-stabbing, unrealized and tragic love, Bette Davis. Whether she is playing the good soul or the evil one (most likely the latter), Davis does drama the best, and \"Old Acquaintance\" is a fine example of her work. Hopkins, who I previously have seen playing fairly harmless and airy characters in (\"The Heiress\") as well as endangered and misunderstood (the wrongfully accused school teacher in \"These Three\") really rolls up her sleeves and digs into this part with obvious relish. She is fantastic, and while you spend most of the movie hating her, you can't help but admire how well Hopkins performs the role. The supporting cast of Loder and Young are fairly solid, and Loder in particular is great as the put-upon, romantic and downtrodden husband. Part of you wants to smirk and call him a wuss and part of you wishes you could date him.\n\nThe story itself is full and solidly carries itself well from the beginning of the film until the end. Coupled with good acting and a couple of great slaps courtesy of La Davis, \"Old Acquaintance\" was a good, meaty film that I watched with great relish, wondering where it had been for the last 20 years I have spent watching all things classic film, and in particular, Bette Davis. There was nothing stupendous about \"Old Acquaintance\" that made me speak in tongues or anything, but it is a wonderful film that has fallen into relative obscurity over the years that deserves to be seen and enjoyed. 8/10 --Shelly",

The two share the ups and downs of a rocky relationship when the lesser writer becomes famous for her trash and loses her ignored husband (John Loder). A very young Gig Young provides some romantic interest for Davis--until she sensibly concludes that he is too young for her. At the end, the two women are left facing middle-age together and, as they sit before a roaring fireplace, toast each other to the fadeout strains of Franz Waxman's music.\n\nAll of this plays like a Cosmopolitan magazine story of the '40s but is made to seem intelligent and likeable by the sheer magnetism of Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, never better than here. Hopkins sinks her teeth into the role of a nasty bitch--and Davis is unusually even-tempered until the scene where she shakes the living daylights out of Hopkins.\n\nForget the 1982 remake directed by George Cukor--like most remakes, it lacked the ingredients that made the original such a treat.",

                "text": "Bette Davis must have been relieved to know that once she was done filming THE OLD MAID, chances were she didn't have to work with Miriam Hopkins again. I can only imagine her expression in having to deal with Hopkins for one more movie after suggestions to re-team with pal Mary Astor didn't fall through. She must have thought it was some kind of sick joke. Or karma. Who knows. To the end of her life she stated that while she respected Hopkins as an actress and even went to say that Hopkins didn't have to take on supporting parts so quickly, she was a congenial person, but working with her was another story.\n\nIt's not hard to see why: Hopkins tries insanely hard to steal every scene she's in from the moment the camera focuses on her back and she talks to Bette Davis' character over the phone in the opening scene. It's as if she were constantly aware of being under the camera lights and she needed to make sure that the viewer would see her as well. It only adds to her insecurity that her shrill performance, while very good, is not the focus of the movie -- indeed, she's off screen for a good chunk of the movie later on -- as it is Davis' character's story.\n\nStill, it makes for great watching: at every turn there is a chance for one of them to try and out-act the other. However, you wouldn't know that they couldn't stand each other here, just like in THE OLD MAID. The opening scenes are quite funny in establishing who Kit Marlowe and Millie Drake are as friends. Kit is the more understanding, the more tolerant of the two: she knows how to deal with her flighty friend and has come to see her quirks as basically that. Millie, while a drama queen who wants to give her friend the biggest reception ever, ever so slightly suggests an envy of Kit's career, but really has no malice towards her. You could tell they're really friends that have since fallen into the rut of duty.\n\nIt's an outsider that begins to see the real nature of this friendship. John Loder, playing Preston Drake, is clearly unhappy in his marriage to Millie but stays by her regardless until he meets the woman he should have married in Kit. He can't see how being so diametrically opposed women they could even be in the same room together -- Millie is just too needy, too over-the-top to the more sensible Kit. However, it's said that every person has his or her complement and the two women, more sisters than friends, seem to be just that.\n\nIt's when Millie begins to succeed as a romance writer -- a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts of her time -- that the friendship starts to show signs of fraying at the seams. Millie shows her claws in hints, and Kit moves on, serving the war and doing more relevant things with her life. But for a movie that has two such stars, it's only fitting that somehow they remain together because after all... they're \"friends\", and this is a soap opera about longtime \"friends\" after all.\n\nOLD ACQUAINTANCE is a good woman's picture. It has good pacing and despite covering over twenty-odd years between the lives of these two women, it doesn't feel slow or repetitive. Interesting is the relationship that develops between Kit and Deirdre (Dolores Moran), Millie's daughter, who at times reacts to Kit as if she were her own mother and not Millie. Of note, as well, is how Davis looks in her role -- one only has to see how she'd look ten years later to see how accurate the make-up department got it. Where the movie goes into its only dramatic moment is the confrontation scene -- dragged out with takes upon takes since Hopkins was overacting, trying to make Davis' character more vicious but only succeeding in making herself look more the vicious woman caught -- and the reconciliation scene, which is highly unlikely. But in ending the movie on this note, it's a striking irony that for the second and last time both actresses who detested each other and had major demands on set gave their best performances. The result is the movie that became OLD ACQUAINTANCE.",

                "text": "After having gone head-to-head in \"The Old Maid\" a few years prior, Davis and Hopkins teamed up for round two in this film. It's a credit to both actresses that, despite their intense loathing for one another, they were able to convey warm and deep friendship on screen when it was called for, even embracing fondly when the touch of one probably repulsed the other. Davis plays a somewhat dowdy, earthy authoress who comes back to her hometown amid much flurry to visit her old school chum Hopkins. Davis writes critically-acclaimed, but lackluster-selling, books yet can't seem to find a man to share her life. Hopkins, on the other hand, has an affectionate husband (Loder) and is about to have a baby, but has no outlet for her own creativity. When Hopkins writes a tacky novel and it's a runaway best-seller, the dynamic between these old friends shifts and before long they are engaged in a rivalry and an unstated game of one-upmanship. The years flow by and, though Davis is still a respected writer and playwright, Hopkins has achieved extraordinary fame and success in her field. When Loder comes between the ladies and Hopkins' daughter Moran, as well, the sparks begin to fly, though never without a certain touch of humor. Davis enjoyed portraying a fairly realistic character in this go-round and came up with the notion that she would wear men's pajama tops to bed as a revealingly quirky trait. Though, as the film wears on, she is given a rather silly grey streak in her hair and becomes more mannered, it's still a well-drawn, interesting performance. Hopkins in at full tilt throughout and gives a zesty, energetic portrayal. One hopes that she was in on the joke of her heavily neurotic and over-the-top character. She provides a lot of the comic content with her exuberant bitchery. Loder gives a friendly, solid, if unspectacular performance. Young appears late in the game as Davis' younger suitor and is very handsome and effective. Moran is also mostly appealing and attractive, though she would exit the business before too long after marrying a producer. Revere shows up in a small, but amusing, role as a reporter. The story is an intriguing one, though there are a few head-scratching elements (such as how Moran has no recollection of what her father looks like when they meet after a lengthy separation.) Also, due to U.S. involvement in WWII coming about after the source play's debut, a bit of patriotic sentiment was incorporated into Davis' role to help assuage the potential fluffiness of such a piece in a time of war. In fact, the initial choice for director turned the project down because he didn't think audiences would care about \"two bitches\" bickering when there's a war on! Fortunately, the film was made as it's a fascinating thing to see these enemies working their craft together with Davis underplaying and Hopkins overplaying and somehow providing a tasty piece of entertainment in the process. Davis would have other nasty rivalries and issues with female stars after this such as with Susan Hayward in \"Where Love Has Gone\" and, infamously, Joan Crawford in \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"",

                "text": "The context for this film makes it a lot more interesting to watch. Several years before this movie was made, Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins also starred in \"Old Maid\". During this filming, the two volatile actresses fought like dogs. It got so bad that Davis even ended up sleeping with Hopkins' husband--and they truly hated each other. In fact, the acrimony between them was far worse than the much publicized feud between Davis and Joan Crawford. How they got these two together for another film is curious, but Davis must have enjoyed it immensely, as she played a woman who was practically a saint and Hopkins was forces to play someone who is thoroughly despicable.\n\nThe film begins in the 1920s. Davis is returning to her old home town after man years' absence. In the interim, she's become a well-respected author and the town is gearing up for her return. However, of all the people anticipating, the one who has put the most energy into it is Hopkins. It seems she and Davis grew up together and Hopkins has grand plans about their reunion. However, it soon becomes obvious that Hopkins really wants to be the center of attention and when others intrude on her plans, she becomes furious and behaves like a child. Davis and Hopkins are able to patch things up--mostly because Davis (like she did throughout the film) made a lot of allowances for friend. In other words, she bit her tongue and remembered how much she cared for her.\n\nDuring this tempestuous reunion, the very shallow Hopkins announces that she thinks it must not be that difficult to become a famous author and she's decided to become one, too! A normal friend would have been annoyed, but Davis takes this in a good-natured way. Amazingly, after a few more years, Hopkins IS a famous author. While not as well-respected as Davis, her books are smash successes. Unfortunately, while she is now rich and famous, her immaturity and selfishness have been allowed to blossom. Though in love with herself, he daughter is more like a household object and her husband can't stand her. Eventually, the husband divulges to Davis that he loves her and asks her to marry him, but Davis is too good a person and sends him packing.\n\nOver time, Davis and Hopkins remain friends. However, as throughout the entire film you wonder why! After all, Hopkins is thoughtless and self-centered. But, Davis is always her friend--helping her raise her daughter (since the husband had long since left). Hopkins' horridly selfish life gets more and more difficult for those around her and the viewer is left to wonder how much longer this will go until Davis kills her. Well, this does lead to one of the best showdowns in film--the scene between them is a true classic. However, by the end, even after this big showdown, the two are reunited as friends--a very dissatisfying ending for an otherwise perfect film.\n\nWhile there is a lot more to the film than this (including a subplot involving Gig Young and the grown daughter of Hopkins), but this is really not all that important--the fireworks between Hopkins and Davis are. That is THE reason to watch this film. And, despite the DVD having a short entitled \"Old Acquaintance: A Classic Woman's Picture\" and having commentary by a gay man throughout the commentary track, I hate when films are seen as a 'woman's film'--\"Old Acquaintance\" is a wonderful film regardless who watches it! This is one straight man who had a thoroughly wonderful time watching!\n\nBy the way, I have read quite a bit about both actresses and can say that both had enormous egos and many around them hated them (though there were many exceptions as well). But, at least in the case of Davis, despite being a rather nasty person, she was a heck of a terrific actress. As for Hopkins, her temperamental nature appears to have led to her once-promising career to have fizzled soon after \"Old Acquaintance\".",

The woman vs. woman war, so prominent in the films of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, gets some serious ammunition with this classic film. As excellent as it is, it is unfortunately not available on VHS/DVD, nor does it get the recognition bestowed upon many of Davis' other, and dare I say, lesser movies.\n\nDavis plays writer Kit Marlowe, a woman who is unable to find true happiness as she selflessly puts the needs of her childhood friend, Milly(Miriam Hopkins), ahead of her own desires. Milly, a self-absorbed, insecure - even childlike - housewife is constantly in competition with Kit. As the two woman have successes over the years, their friendship endures strains, but never totally collapses. The battle between them even extends to Milly's teenage daughter(Dolores Moran)during the later years of their lives.\n\nDavis nails the cattiness, insecurity and self-effacing humor that embodies Kit. Hopkins also succeeds as Milly. Even though Milly's self-destructive jealousies border on tedious and Hopkins almost succumbs to over-acting, Hopkins manages to pull back the reigns just in time. As good as \"Old Acquaintance\" is, however, there are moments that just don't ring true. For example, why wouldn't a teenage Deirdre(Moran)recognize her own father(John Loder), even if she hadn't seen him in a decade? Surely she would have seen a photo or had a faint memory. Despite that, though, this is a great classic just waiting to be restored and released. Fine writing, classic lines, smooth direction and stellar performances are what drive this film.

Lo and behold, the book becomes a best seller, starting Millie on a career eclipsing her old friend's career, but she loses her husband along the way when she lets success go to her head.\n\nThe subplots swirl around these two women...Millie's envy of Kit and then Kit's help turns Millie into a success but she loses her husband who becomes infatuated with Kit. Preston professes his love for Kit, but she in turn tells him no because of Millie and her daughter. Kit falls in love with a younger man, but she finds herself unwilling to commit because of his age. He in turn falls in love with Millie's daughter. When Kit finally realizes what she has and wants to be with him, he admits to her how he has fallen for another woman..the daughter Kit never had..the daughter of her best friend. The threads weave in and out of these two women keeping them bound together. \n\nWhen Millie finds out Preston was attracted to Kit long ago, she sets this scene up which is one of the funniest I've seen from Bette Davis. Millie admits to Kit that she told her daughter Kit and Preston were having an affair. She goes off on a self-pitying tirade at Kit. Kit tries to reason with her to no avail. Finally, Kit leaves the apartment only to come right back again. She walks over to Millie and then shakes the life out of her and throws her down on the couch.\n\nAfter reading interviews by Ms. Davis about some of her frustration at some roles she has endured, it was a revealing look at how she wanted to shake the life out of some producers and directors. Ms. Hopkin's hair and shoulders were just shaking with it, and you have to wonder how many takes it took for this one.\n\nThe end finds them there in Kit's apartment drinking champagne and watching the fire. They've shared more than just a friendship now. They're shared the loss of love but have kept their friendship intact.\n\nThis is a delightful movie, and one worth watching. It reminds us how friends alway stick no matter what. No one is perfect and each have faults and good qualities. It is true \"old acquaintances\" can accept both good and bad and stick to the end!",

Davis starts off very fresh and natural, but as her character ages and becomes glamorously middle-aged, Bette's affectations and mannerisms tread a self-parody; she's good throughout the film, yet one longs for more of that earthy quality she displays in the film's first hour.

It is the quintessential star vehicle and two Broadway legends, Jane Cowl and Peggy Wood played the rival women on stage. On screen the film version stars Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins and in this instance it really helped to have two women who positively loathed each other in real life. Helped enormously with their performances.\n\nThe two are childhood friends and rival authors, Bette is a writer of seriously acclaimed classics that just don't sell and Miriam is the Jacqueline Susann of the pair, a writer of potboiler trash fiction that the public eats up. For reasons never explained by the film, Miriam nurses a pent up jealousy over Bette which Davis patiently bears throughout most of the film which takes place over a twenty year period in their lives. Davis rightly can't figure it out, Miriam is the one with the husband and child both of whom she smothers with her overbearing personality. \n\nThe Broadway play which took place in only one setting, the Davis character's apartment was considerably expanded for the screen and I will say that the play's stage origins are barely noticeable. The play and the film are strictly vehicles for the two stars, the other players would dare not intrude even if their parts permitted. \n\nOld Acquaintance in the hands of players less capable of Davis and Hopkins would be a disaster.

                "text": "As powerful as Bette Davis was in Hollywood in the early 1940's, the biggest female star of her era wasn't above giving less so another performer could have more. Her subtlety in \"The Great Lie\" lead to Mary Astor winning an Oscar; She graciously took second fiddle to the outrageous Monty Woolley in \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\", and allowed Paul Lukas front burner in \"Watch on the Rhine\" to lead him to his own Oscar as well. For her second pairing with Miriam Hopkins, she simply reacted while Hopkins overacted, and the result was Davis stealing away the film without really trying.\n\nLike her character in \"The Old Maid\" (her first pairing with Hopkins), sympathy ended up being on her side, not Hopkins. At least in \"The Old Maid\", Hopkins allowed subtly fake charm to dominate her performance. But here, she chews the scenery with so much venom, the meat of her performance never reaches her digestive system. She makes the character of the selfish and silly housewife and mother-to-be so resentful of Davis that it seems that she actually hates every aspect of the character that Davis plays, fictional or not. Whether or not the truth of the rivalry between these two ladies off screen was true or not, Davis acts like it is non-existent, while Hopkins seems determined to upstage her co-star every chance she gets.\n\nEven when they are having meaningful heart-to-hearts, Hopkins acts entirely too grand, as if she was the diva in an opera, and the sympathy that should be there for her character (abandoned by her husband after she achieves success as a writer of trashy romantic novels) simply vanishes. After one confrontation, it is obvious that Davis's character (and perhaps Bette herself) has just had enough, quietly shuts the door, walks back to Hopkins after changing her mind about leaving, and you can hear yourself shouting, \"Knock her lights out!\"\n\nHopkins, so good in her early romantic dramas, sinks to a new low here, and thus after this, was reduced to touring mostly in stock and supporting parts in films where she often bellowed her lines. The one film of her later career that somehow lacked this was a sympathetic role in \"The Heiress\" where she simply played the role as written. John Loder wins sympathy as Hopkins' husband who smartly walks out after simply having had enough, leaving her with barely a word. Gig Young is handsome as the younger man who proposes to Davis, all the while unknowingly in love with Hopkins and Loder's grown-up daughter (Donna Moran). \n\nIf you want to see the difference between a braying performance and one with similar selfishness played with realistic acting, watch Moran's initially spoiled brat have her tantrum then slowly return to reality with a glow as she begins to see things beyond her own ego. Esther Dale gets some good moments as Davis's housekeeper, and Anne Revere has a memorable one-scene cameo as a reporter interviewing Davis. Hopkins really does well in this one scene with her reaction to Revere's embarrassment after insulting typical romantic trash novels like herself.\n\nIn spite of the film's short-comings, this soap opera is fascinating to watch, and one longs to have been an extra or crew member to have witnessed what really went on. Davis makes her acting look so easy, but at times, you begin to feel sorry for everybody in the film and on the set (even Hopkins) because it seems that everybody (including her) must have had a terrible headache because of her constant ranting.",

It's beautifully done with a good script, direction and acting. It's never dull and the passing of years is done great. Hopkins is WAY over the top here screeching most of her lines, marching across a room, arms flying, eyes wide open...but it fits her character. Davis is much more low-key and it works beautifully.

From there, we start to see her friend become envious/jealous and this is a catalyst for her to become and author like Davis is...but with romance novels instead. This premise leads to fights, marriage break-up and Davis basically raising her friends child. Her friends whole life is success and she equates that to money. Money makes things better. But Davis doesn't live/see life like that.\n\nThe whole film you realize that Davis is just a really good person. She's very patient and just nice to everyone and genuinely cares for her friend and there family. She's what everyone should strive to be like. Basically, she's the rock of the group. I think this film really hits the nail on the head with what real friendships are like in real life. One in the bunch who's the rock and one who's over ambitious and thinks money is the most important thing.

Millie, on the other hand, already married to a successful engineer and also pregnant, decides to compete with Kit and write too. However, she pounds out trashy romance novels that are a hit with the masses and therefore make her rich but not critically acclaimed. And that's really all that Millie has wanted since childhood - to be better at Kit at SOMETHING. And yet she keeps failing because Kit's strength is not in what she has but what she is.\n\nNow Hopkins plays Millie so over the top and childish that it is hard to dislike her. She takes her husband, Preston, for granted and loses him - he grows to love Kit but she says that is a line friends simply do not cross, even if the break up of the marriage had nothing to do with their feelings. Millie spends so much time on her career that her daughter Deirdre comes to think of Kit as a mom just as much as Millie. How will this all work out? Watch and find out. I will tell you that the surprises are in the men, not in the women. Millie takes everything the way you would expect her to - throwing temper tantrums dressed in the finest fashions while Kit is the lighthouse, the rock of stability through everything. Now back to the men. For one thing Millie's ex-husband doesn't bother to see his daughter for over ten years! He wouldn't have seen her even then had it not been for Kit bringing them together. Preston is no bum, he's had a good career, but no time or place for his daughter in his life? Then there is Kit's beau during the war years who is ten years younger than her and is constantly nagging her to marry him. Their age means nothing he promises, she's all he's ever wanted ...

Davis helps her out and, of course, Hopkins becomes a big success, much to the chagrin of Davis and her now neglected husband Loder.\n\nYears later, Davis is dating Gig Young, whom she thinks is about to propose to her but who has actually now fallen for Hopkins's daughter Dolores Moran. Hopkins's character wants to reconcile with her own estranged husband Loder, who is uninterested but does seem attracted to Davis's worldly sophistication.

I got to thinking that if someone asked me what the film was about in ONE sentence, I couldn't tell them. It would take a paragraph...or more.\n\nBut importantly, this film finally answered a question I have long had. Was Miriam Hopkins a really good actress? After watching this film a couple of times, I have come to the conclusion that the answer is NO! NO! A thousand times NO! I think she is horrible and over-the-top in this film, and frankly I have grown tired of her frequent performances as a foolish ninny. Perhaps some others agreed, since after this film she didn't make another movie for 6 long years. If you want to watch a horrid performance, perhaps this is a good reason for you to watch this film.

John Loder, as Hopkin's husband, is very pleasant here, and he's in a role that is very sympathetic. And, Esther Dale is wonderful, as always, playing the maid.\n\nIn terms of plot, in my view it wanders. You're unlikely to be able to get a grasp of where the story is going. At first this is refreshing when you assume Mariam Hopkins book is going to be awful and she will hate Bette Davis for telling her so. Instead, Hopkins goes on to write pop books that sell, while Davis writes deeper books that don't sell, but impress the critics.

            "Jealous of best friend Kit, a critically acclaimed but financially unsuccessful author and playwright, Millie writes a novel, the first in a string of bestselling trashy novels. After eight years of neglect and taking a backseat to Millie's fame, her husband Preston leaves her. Another decade passes and Kit announces her intention of marrying the decade-younger Rudd. Millie thinks Preston wishes to reconcile, only to discover he is engaged. He also admits that he was in love with Kit, who had turned down his many advances. Feeling Kit to blame for the failure of her marriage, Millie flies into a rage and confronts Kit. Later, learning of Rudd's affection for Millie's daughter Diedre, Kit graciously steps aside to bless their union. In the end, Millie and Kit make up, sharing a champagne toast for each one's old acquaintance.",
            "Approximately twenty years, from 1924 to current day, is presented in the unlikely lifelong friendship between practical Kit Marlowe and melodramatic Millie Watson Drake. As young adults, they take different paths, Kit a professional one as a critically well respected but admittedly not populist novelist, and Millie a personal one as a wife and mother, to Preston Drake and Deirdre \"Deedee\" Drake respectively. But Millie, envious of Kit's path, believes she can do equally well or even better on the writing front. Unlike Kit who researched and painstakingly mapped out her stories to her own satisfaction, Millie churns out her pulp fiction with great speed and ease, and is rewarded with public success in the process. In Millie starting to neglect both Preston and Deedee in the process of basking in her newfound fame and wealth, Kit begins to contemplate having more of a personal life herself, mostly in Deedee longing for a true mother figure upon who she can rely, but also in a romantic life with one of the many men who admire and/or love her."

Ever since I first saw Lindsay as Nikki Porter in the Ellery Queen film series I became a fan, and I'm trying to collect as many of her B-movies as I can, with an emphasis on the mystery-comedies (she did a bunch of those around 1938-1943). \"Honeymoon Deferred\" is a minor but likable effort, with a well-written plot (although the mystery is mostly cleared-up, by the movie itself, long before the end), and Lindsay is as always a delight to watch. There is also an outstanding supporting performance by Anne Gwynne. **1/2 out of 4.",

Yes, there is a propaganda side, but it's also an introduction to this poet's life (and a big movie on it's own). Curiosly no one saw the anti-fascist subtext (Leit\u00e3o de Barros' real opinion of the fascists?): references to the inquisition as censorship and as something that should be feared (not a protection to good manners as the regime told...), a poet (a alter ego of Barros) that just wanted to create his art, but saw his life cursed by political conspiracies from advisers of a \"great leader\" that thought him self absolute but was always manipulated (a portrait of Salazar?), and his successor, inspired by Camoens's (Cam\u00f5es in Portuguese) epic poem \u00abThe Lusiads\u00bb (\u00abOs Lus\u00edadas\u00bb) to involve in a war that destroys the realm (a prediction of what would happen to the generations raised by salazarism and didn't knew the previous freedom, losing them selves in wars for the empire?). But the fascists didn't helped this movie a lot (they preferred propaganda docs to fiction films, so most Portuguese movies were short: most not even covered an hole tape!; and the budget wasn't enough for rendering an epic fitting the life of this epic poet with an epic life, although the biggest till then. Because of the lack of budget they had to leave the epic side for the lyric and dramatic one...it's not the same thing! If this difficulties were overcome it could be as long and as enormous as Willer's Ben-Hur). But just like Ben-Hur isn't just for Christians, Cam\u00f5es isn't just for Portuguese, but unfortunately we (the Portuguese)are still bloody dumb and don't realize how important it would be for our country and culture to make this and other movies internationally famous (for the love of God/good! Red western are more famous than this masterpiece!). Also a great score by Portuguese classic composer Ruy Coelho, our Prokofiev.",

                "text": "\nThis film tells the story of portuguese poet Luiz Vaz de Camoes (1525-1580), there for a Renaissance poet. As an important introduction, he is one of most, if not the most, important figure of portuguese culture (so you can evaluate for yourself, our national day is the day the poet died, 10 June). Personally speaking, as I am portuguese, I'm glad that this film exists, since it shows an important attempt to pass Portugal's history,which being so rich has been somewhat neglected by portuguese filmmakers, to cinema. I consider the final result pretty positive, and this to be one good example of portuguese 40's cinema. It is true that Camoes is in here reduced to what we perfectly know of him, the director takes no chance in assuming things that might have been true and shows us little of the real depths of the poet's soul (that is in fact the main flaw of the film, we don't get to be shown why was he in fact such a genious and inspired poet as he in fact was...) but than again that gives autenticy and historical reliability to the film. I also enjoy the way you see the character progress throughout the film, in the end he looks and acts really as the old, bittered man he was, as in the beginning looks young, joyful and healthy. This evolution is noticed mainly in my opinion because of the outstanding superb acting of one the greatest gentleman of portuguese cinema, Antonio Vilar who would after this film be invited to several foreign productions, proving the recognition he had after this one. Great moments, among them the ende, Camoes death, really touching, and the scene preceding his departure to India, in which he decides to tell portuguese history in a poem that was to become a sort of portuguese \"bible\", Os Lusiadas. That scene is very powerful, since the music is excelent along with the images from the walls (and in here I deeply regret the film wasn't coloured because I believe this scene would double its strenght).\n\nStill I have to regret that Camoes exile years were reduced in the film to a\nmere report on what he did and to a legendary, almost unavoidable scene of the ship wreckage in which he saves his master piece but swimming with only one arm. Those very rich years were very important in his life and put in the film would, I'm shure, make it a real gem, almost another masterpiece (the solution would be to take some time spent in intrigues and romantic misadventures and put it in the journey years). Still those are direction options, maybe also conditioned by financial difficulties. Petty though.\n\nAn excelent, I mean five stars note to the soundtrack, by Ruy Coelho, an important portuguese composer, who makes here the right music for the right moments. All the moments have the right music to support them. Also the general acting is very good, petty this generation of portuguese actors wasn't so used in good films like this as it might have been... Though watch this, you may learn something and if you are portuguese notice how well every word of our beautiful language is pronounced, though the film sound (and image) is not so great you can clearly understand every word... I would like to hear this clear sounding portuguese in today's actors...",

Each episode of Maisie's fabulous life is done as a separate entity as if the previous one never happened. So don't get too attached to anyone.\n\nMaisie, stranded as usual, stows away on a ship that doesn't go the way she wants and, in fact, breaks down. She tags along with a rubber plantation manager (John Carroll) when he hikes to his old house where he worked as a doctor (he's since forsaken the Hippocratic oath). Now it's the home of a doctor who does research (Sheppard Strudwick) and his wife (Rita Johnson).\n\n\"Congo Maisie\" is chock full of adventure, with Maisie assisting in an emergency operation and, wearing a gown and a Carmen Miranda headpiece from her club act, fends off witch doctors. It's quite funny but as my sister yelled out to me hearing some of it, \"Is that a politically incorrect movie you're watching in there?\" Uh, yeah.\n\nJohn Carroll is the new object of Maisie's affections. He talks a lot and uses a monotone that becomes grating real fast. I recall a photo of him where he was presented as a Gable wannabe. Forget it. Rita Johnson is absolutely lovely, and Sheppard Strudwick is very good. Fun.",

It's so over the top it feels like the series has \"jumped the shark\" and the brassy showgirl from Brooklyn finds herself in Africa in an isolated medical camp surrounded by restless natives. \n\nIn all her films Maisie gets into hilarious situations, but the best scenes are when her suffering stage acts go horribly wrong just before she gets fired.... In Congo Maisie however the \"disaster\" stage act comes at the climax when she must out voodoo a native witch doctor with hokey illusions from her nightclub act - and of course this means she has to present her entire show including singing St Louis Woman to the accompaniment of native drums while wearing a showgirl costume. This is mere minutes after assisting in emergency surgery, meanwhile clearing up the relationships of everyone around her.... It's all for laughs at a manic screwball pace. Southern moves briskly from scene to scene holding the energy. By the time she starts doing her nightclub act in the jungle I was in love.\n\nAll the Maisie movies are charmers, and as the series progressed Maisie joins the war, works in an airplane factory, goes out west and discovers a hidden goldmine.... Maisie is practically a prototype of Scooby-Doo-esque iconic American adventures, borrowing liberally from trendy plot lines appropriate for a B comedy. They are all feather light and Ann Southern puts so much heart and sweetness into her character, It's wonderful to see same Maisie story progression, her fighting and falling in love with her leading man again and again - even though we know it won't be the same guy next time, poor Maisie!\n\nBut Congo Maisie is the one that really stands out as the most outrageous and off the hook. It breaks from the apple pie formula into stylized farce, and pokes fun at so many movie tropes of the day that it stands out from the rest of the series as a funny parody of many films, from Harlow's Red Dust to Ann Harding's Prestige, all painted with broad strokes and with snappy dialog.",

Kerrigan, E.E. Clive, Everett Brown, Tom Fadden, Lionel Pape and Nathan Curry) appears in its story's periphery, the lion's share of this jungle tale concentrates upon its second leads (Rita Johnson, as Kay McWade, and Shepperd Strudwick, as Doctor John 'Jock' McWade), its leading man (John Carroll, as Doctor Michael Shane) and, especially, its ever-lovely leading lady (Ann Sothern, as Maisie Ravier).\n\nThis time around, Maisie books her nightclub act at a remote village up river from a western African port. Again impoverished, she cleverly stows away upon a river barge to attempt to reach her destination but is soon discovered by its renter, Doctor Shane (John Carroll).\n\nEvicted from his quarters, but remaining on board, she pawns trinkets for morsels of breakfast, about which time it is learned that the barge must dock for several days because of rising waters.\n\nStranded from the raft, Doctor Shane reluctantly \"rescues\" Maisie, by inviting her to accompany him on a three- or four-mile hike through the uninviting wilderness to the nearby fortified medical research station, which he once managed.\n\nHere, Maisie is welcomed by its current operators, Kay and Doctor John McWade (the pretty Rita Johnson and the kind and gentlemanly Shepperd Strudwick). Miss Johnson is often cast as a \"foresaken first wife\" or \"a possessive and haughty other woman.\" Here, she combines the types in gentle fashion, forlorn from her station in life, and seeking the advances of a handsome suitor.\n\nAnd Maisie, with her present bag of resources and presence-of-mind perception to figure the score, suddenly finds herself with her hands full, facing the breaking down of her hosts' marriage, a patient in need of emergency surgery, treacherous weather conditions, an impending attack on the fort by tribal natives, simultaneously, while trying to resolve her feud and feelings for Doctor Shane, before the raft sets sail again.",

They were clearly B-movies--short, relatively low budget (for MGM) and meant as second films in a double-feature. Yet, despite this, they also were very polished and entertaining. Clearly, MGM made nice looking B-films.\n\nIn this second installment, Maisie is inexplicably in central Africa! Why is never really explained well and seeing the blonde Sothern traipsing about what is supposed to be African jungle is rather surreal. As far as the plot goes, it's a reworking of \"Red Dust\" but due to the Production Code, the sexiness of the remake is much more subdued than the original. In the original, Jean Harlow was a tramp--a nice tramp but clearly a tramp. Here, Maisie is a nice girl--a show girl but a NICE show girl.\n\nWhen the film begins, Maisie stows away on a boat. Instead of heading down river to Lagos, it heads up river to disease-ridden and superstition-filled jungle. Along the way, she teams up with a grumpy ex-doctor, Dr. Shane (John Carrol), and they head to a jungle hospital--where the \"Red Dust\"-like plot ensues. There, another doctor's wife is bored and lonely and immediately falls for Dr. Shane. But, Maisie being a good girl, she does what she can to help the lady realize her problems WON'T be solved with an affair. How all this works out you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nAside from stealing a few clips from \"Trader Horn\", the film looks pretty good for a stage-bound B-movie set in the jungle. And, the acting and story work well. Overall, it's an agreeable little film and a decent remake since the story is more a reworking than a direct remake. Worth your time even if it is a bit patronizing in how it depicts many of the Africans.",

            "Streetwise and kindhearted Maisie Ravier is a vaudeville performer. For the last little while, she has been working throughout Africa, currently in Kurmala, West Africa. With no money either to pay her current rent or to make it to her next gig in Lagos, Maisie stows away on a freighter which she believes is going across the bay to Lagos. However, it ends up being a river boat heading up stream. The only passenger aboard is American Michael Shane, a former M.D. who seems to be angry at the world about his life. He is heading back to his rubber plantation, which he got for a song since no other white man wanted to cultivate this remote piece of property. When Maisie is found aboard, it's hate at first sight between Maisie and Michael. Maisie also learns that she cannot get off the boat until they dock at their end point, which is far away from where she wants to go. However, they end up docking sooner than expected as, in the middle of the jungle, the boat experiences mechanical difficulties, which ends up taking weeks to repair. In the meantime, Michael and Maisie are forced to hike miles through the jungle to spend their time at the medical station associated with the Atkinson Rubber Plantation. Michael knows the route well since this station was his last post as a doctor two years ago, where he spent five years. Dr. John McWade is the current physician and researcher, who lives there with his wife, Kay. Eventually, Maisie learns about Michael's past life as a doctor and perhaps why he gave it up. But she can also see that although John and Kay love each other, Kay, who has not mentioned it to John, is unhappy at being so isolated from the life she knew and felt comfortable with in the US. These issues lead to a difficult situation between the four, especially as Kay starts to fall for the womanizing Michael. However, they may have bigger worries as John's focus on research has led to the neglect of the locals, who are reverting back to the use of witch doctors. The witch doctors will do anything, including kill the white intruders, to retain their power over the superstitious locals. Playing into those superstitions is the only way the four may be able to save themselves."

Oddly enough nobody ever thought of putting three of them or all four into the same film, but problems regarding budgets and a decent, sensible script would probably have prevented it. In any event, such a script would have relied on Crosby being at the center of action/activity. In his individual pairings he does share the screen time with each partner.\n\nBut GOING MY WAY created a sequel that did not bring back Barry. It was THE BELLS OF ST. MARY, a Christmas story about a Catholic religious school run by Ingrid Bergman. It too was a success, but it did not have Fitzgerald's elderly, wise but cantankerous priest in it. Fortunately WELCOME STRANGER was made a few years after, and gave Bing and Barry another good script with equal time to shine in their roles.\n\nBasically it is the same plot: A small New England town has had the services of Fitzgerald as their doctor. He's been a good doctor, and has been campaigning for a new hospital for the town. The town council, represented by Charles Dingle, has finally agreed. But Dingle has doubts about the elderly Fitzgerald running the hospital - he wants a younger man, with scholarly attainments.\n\nBut this is all in the future. Fitzgerald has to go to Boston on a business trip, and he comes back on one of the crack railway trains that used to crisscross our country. He is sitting in a compartment with a young man, Crosby, who is going to answer an advertisement for a doctor who can assist an elderly doctor in a small town in Maine (you guessed it - it's an advertisement the crusty Fitzgerald was pressured into putting into the paper). Soon the two are arguing (correction: Fitzgerald is arguing - Crosby is calm, as always), about a missing pipe belonging to Fitzgerald (Crosby finds Fitzgerald was sitting on it). Crosby leaves the \"chilly\" compartment for the dining room, and orders the fresh trout for dinner. Unfortunately Fitzgerald follows soon after, and he has been looking forward to his favorite dinner on this train (you guessed it: the trout). He's definitely deflated to find that 1) they are out of trout now, and 2) Crosby got the last trout.\n\nSo begins another typical \"opposites\" attract Bing and Barry story. Instead of Catholic priests it is country doctors. But Crosby slowly, begrudgingly gains the respect and friendship of the older man again, and likewise he finds that Fitzgerald is a first rate, sensible doctor.\n\nCrosby also starts dating Joan Caulfield, which annoys Robert Shayne her present beau. What's worse, Shayne is the son of Charles Dingle, and this makes Dingle less than friendly to Crosby as a doctor, or a potential assistant head to the new hospital. Both are soon pushing a friend of Shayne's, Larry Young.\n\nThe film is an amusing, well-made comedy, and the townspeople are quite realistic. Even the pompous Dingle has a moment of realism that lifts him from his usual villainous activities into the real world of cynicism. He is finding the town has a possible medical emergency, and a vaccine might be needed. He contacts the town's Congressman, Thurston Hall, who we see in his office in Washington. The two have a so-called serious conversation about the vaccine, with Hall going through his typical bluster, while Dingle (who whatever his pomposity was always straight to the point) tries to keep to the topic. Hall keeps forgetting or confusing his Dingle's identity or name, until finally Charles zings it very nicely to Thuston: \"Why is it you can only remember my name around election time?\" It was a brief moment but Charles finally spoke for all of us!",

On the train back, he meets happy go lucky Bing Crosby, whom he takes an instant dislike for due to situations beyond both of their control. Not realizing that Crosby is his replacement, Fitzgerald is more than a little put out when all is revealed. As Fitzgerald prepares to leave, he suffers an attack of appendicitis, which Crosby operates on him for. This changes their relationship, and Fitzgerald opens his eyes to Crosby's genial manner. But Crosby upsets the son of a local money-man (Charles Dingle), who decides out of the blue to get a more modern doctor in town to replace Fitzgerald permanently. Crosby, who has planned to leave town, decides to stay to fight for Fitzgerald's job and for the young girl (Joan Caulfield) he has come to love.\n\nThis warm-hearted small town comedy/drama (with several songs sung by you-know-who) is charming from the start, focusing on the chemistry between Crosby and Fitzgerald rather than the romance of Crosby and Caulfield. A rousing square dance number happens in a scene where Crosby meets the townsfolk who are as cold as a thermometer in December if you ask about the weather in July, and resemble the Vermont townspeople spoofed in the screwball comedy classic \"Nothing Sacred\". Elizabeth Patterson and Percy Kilbride are among the memorable supporting players. A storyline involving an alcoholic newspaper reporter and his daughter is never fully resolved, but simply expands on the personality and humanity of its leading character. Crosby has a few digs at Hope and Sinatra, claiming that unlike Frankie, he can sing while taking blood, but other than that, simply recites his lines with little emotional range. When Caulfield comments on the fact that Crosby seems to avoid unpleasant situations, it somewhat justifies Crosby's seemingly too understated performance.\n\nAs for Barry Fitzgerald, it is obvious from the get go that this curmudgeon is hiding a sweet nature, and sometimes there just seems to be no reason he's so instantly so cold to Crosby other than a series of unfortunate occurrences that are beyond both their controls. Patterson, as Fitzgerald's feisty housekeeper, has a lot of great lines, while Kilbride, as the town's only cab driver, is amusing as well. Small-town movies are usually too sweet or sentimental over portraying \"the perfect life\", but \"Welcome Stranger\" is actually a lot more real than the lovable townspeople often portrayed in Frank Capra's \"fantastic\" series of classic films. Not perfect, \"Welcome Stranger\" is a step above similar movies, and is a highly recommended sleeper.",

Just like in Going My Way, they don't hit it off at first, but circumstances push them together and by the end of the picture they're fast friends and Bing ends up with schoolmarm Joan Caulfield.\n\nWelcome Stranger does stand on its own merits as a picture, it's not just a pale imitation of Going My Way. Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke give Bing four good songs. Personally, I think the highlight of the movie is Bing singing and calling the square dance in Country Style.\n\nHe also sings a nice number called Smile Right Back At the Sun. Crosby had a song genre all his own, the upbeat philosophical songs and this is a perfect example of that kind of number. It's in the same vein as Swinging on a Star. No other singer ever sang so many numbers of that type as Crosby or sung them so well.\n\nOne of my favorite character actors Charles Dingle is the villain of the piece. Whether he's a serious or a comic villain like here, Dingle never disappoints with his patented brand of pomposity.\n\nI would venture one criticism of the film. I believe Frank Faylen and Wanda Hendrix who play father and daughter could have had their characters more fully developed. I think a lot of their performances was edited out of the finished product.\n\nBut Welcome Stranger is still grand entertainment, Crosby and Paramount at their best.",

So when I saw this film listed, and starring Crosby and (again) Barry Fitzgerald, I thought I'd watch it, but I expected little. I was wrong. Of the Crosby-Fitzgerald films, this is by far the most pleasant and most entertaining. It's the simple story of an old small-town doctor who needs a temporary assistant to replace him while he goes on his first extended vacation. Crosby arrives, and there's an instant dislike between the two. Of course, over time that mellows, and they develop a wonderful relationship. It's how they get there that provides the plot, and it's charming and heartwarming, but not sickeningly so.\n\nAlong the way there are some very nice performances by Joan Caulfield (who also starred with Crosby in \"Blue Skies\", Frank Faylen (as a drunken newspaper editor), Elizabeth Patterson (a grand character actress as the maid), and Robert Shayne (as the other romantic interest of Caulfield, and also remembered as the police inspector on the \"Superman\" television series). Percy Kilbride is along for the ride (literally), basically playing the same enjoyable character he always played.\n\nIt's hard to resist liking the affable movie that's sort of a mix of a drama and romance, with a little humor and a couple of songs thrown in. Crosby was tops at the time, and it shows. Oh, and watch for some asides about Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra!",

                "text": "Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald, who scored a hit playing Catholic priests in \"Going My Way,\" reunited a few years later in this tale of small-town doctors. I expected this to be just a secular version of the earlier film. In a way it is, but it starts out considerably darker.\n\nCrosby's character, a free-spirited young physician named Jim Pearson, is pretty much like the priest he once played, except that this guy has an eye for the ladies. Pearson is easygoing, quick with a quip and blessed with a great singing voice. \n\nBut Fitzgerald's character, Dr. Joe McRory, is a less likable version of the crusty old priest he portrayed earlier. At least at the beginning of the film, McRory is not just eccentric and cantankerous, he's moody and sometimes downright mean.\n\nEarly on, Pearson heads to the little community of Fallbridge, Maine, to assist McRory's practice. The two men meet accidentally without knowing each other's identities, and due to a series of trivial mix-ups, the old doctor develops a nasty grudge against the young stranger. McRory's insistence on quarreling at every turn is supposed to be funny, but it makes him seem almost unhinged.\n\nThe misunderstanding is soon resolved. But McRory, instead of laughing it off, tries to drive Pearson out of town, denouncing him as a quack and a scoundrel.\n\nThe prickly old doctor persuades the leading folks in Fallbridge to give Pearson the cold shoulder, too. Among these people is pretty schoolteacher/amateur nurse Trudy Mason (played by Joan Caulfield), who fights her obvious attraction to the newcomer by repeatedly insulting him.\n\nNone of this makes any sense, because young Dr. Pearson is always the soul of geniality. In fact, the attitude of the old doc and the town's elite is so illogical that you wonder how the hero will ever get through to them.\n\nFortunately, this is a Bing Crosby movie, with upbeat songs, contrived situations and gentle jests, some of them done with the proverbial wink at the audience. Eventually, the Crosby charm starts to work its magic on these stony New England hearts. Better late than never.\n\nSome of the most memorable characters in this movie are the minor ones, the town's more marginal citizens who, unlike the establishment types, are friendly to Pearson from the start. Percy Kilbride is perfect as a cabdriver who likes to share his homespun philosophy. Frank Faylen plays the town journalist and town drunk, an interesting mix. \n\nAnd Wanda Hendrix is totally convincing as a lonely, plain 13-year-old girl (the drunk's daughter) who develops a crush on the kindly young physician. It's hard to believe Hendrix was already 18 and on the threshold of the glamorous, sexy roles for which she's best remembered today. She was a better actress than I'd always thought.",

                "text": "WELCOME STRANGER (Paramount, 1947), directed by Elliott Nugent, with its dramatic sounding title, stars crooner Bing Crosby in another one of his most popular movies that's become forgotten during the course of the years. Aside from reuniting him with his charming BLUE SKIES (1946) co-star, Joan Caulfied, the attentions rests mainly on the reunion of Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald, stars and Academy Award winners from the Best Picture win of GOING MY WAY (1944). With Crosby and Fitzgerald playing priests with differences of opinion proved so successful, their second venture, basically the same premise, offers them another shot in the arm for their roles as doctors. \n\nThe story opens in Boston where Doctor Joseph McRory (Barry Fitzgerald), from the small town of Fallbridge, Maine, planning his first vacation in 35 years, arrives at the Physician and Surgeon Placement Bureau to meet with Mr. Daniels (Paul Stanton) to inquire about the doctor who's to fill in for him for the next two months. Being told that the selected Doctor Jim Pearson is on his way to Fallbridge, McRory takes the next train home to meet with him. While on board, McRory encounters a fellow passenger (Bing Crosby) who, through no fault of his own, constantly gets on his nerves. Upon his return, McCrory gets to meet Pearson, who turns out to be the stranger he met on the train. Going over his qualifications, he finds Pearson incompetent, resenting his down-to-earth medical methods, the clothes he wears, and occasional singing. Pearson soon meets Trudy Mason (Joan Caulfield), a local schoolteacher who volunteers her time assisting McRory at his clinic, who, too, finds the new city doctor quite arrogate and taking an instant dislike to him as well. As he tries to get to know her better, she informs him she's engaged to Roy Chesley (Robert Shayne), the town pharmacist. As much as Pearson has become an unwelcome stranger in town, the only one who's grown to like him is McRory's housekeeper, Mrs. Gilley (Elizabeth Patterson), who offers him advise how to improve himself, like \"by not talking so much.\" As McRory gets to go on his long awaited fishing trip, an emergency occurs that prevents him from going. Through the course of time, Pearson proves himself an asset to the community, though McRory continues to have his doubts about him. Situations occur when Charles J. Chesley (Charles Dingle), head of the town council, arranges to phase McRory out of his profession in favor of a much younger doctor, Ronnie Jenks (Larry Young), to take charge of the hospital.\n\nIn the supporting cast are Wanda Hendrix as Emily, a young teenager with a crush on the Pearson; Frank Faylen as Bill Waters, Emily's father and editor of the Fallbridge Weekly newspaper with a drinking problem; Percy Kilbride in his droll but amusing pre-\"Pa Kettle\" caricature of Nat Dorkas, a local taxi driver; Thurston Hall appearing briefly as Congressman Beeker; as well as the film's own director, Elliott Nugent assuming a small role as Doctor White. \n\nConcentrating more on plot than songs, it's become one of the least tuneful of the Crosby films at that time. All sung by Bing Crosby, the motion picture soundtrack, with songs by James Van Heusen and Johnny Burke, include: \"Smile Right Back at the Sun,\" \"Country Style,\" \"My Heart is a Hobo,\" and \"As Long as I'm Dreaming.\" \"Country Style\" is a highlight production where everyone gathers together in the barn as Crosby's character calls to lead and sing to a square dance. For the fishing sequence with Fitzgerald, Crosby catches more fish through his singing of \"My Heart is a Hobo.\" \"As Long as I'm Dreaming,\" is a nice tune worthy of mention set on a sleigh ride, through nothing close to becoming an Academy Award nominee as \"Swinging on a Star\" from GOING MY WAY. \n\nWELCOME STRANGER has that sort of feel-good style of either directors Frank Capra or Leo McCarey. In true Crosby tradition, his character looks on the positive side regardless of negative obstacles. Crosby and Fitzgerald make a grand pair of opposites, which is why their chemistry works so well. Comparing their performances here to GOING MY WAY would not be out of the ordinary. Though teamed together again in TOP O THE MORNING (1949), it proved to be the weakest of their three collaborations and least known and revived. Taking a cue from Bob Hope comedies, Crosby gets into the act by throwing in an in-joke on his own. Being told there's Bob Hope movie being shown in town, Crosby's character naturally passes it up. The best portion of the entire film, however, in regards to comedy, is the official meeting between Crosby and Fitzgerald meet, where everything seems to go wrong.\n\nFormerly shown on cable television's American Movie Classics (1995-1998), later on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: January 24, 2013), and placed on video cassette in 1995, and a decade later on DVD as a companion piece to Crosby's earlier underrated gem, SING YOU SINNERS (1938), WELCOME STRANGER, as a whole, may not offer much by ways of excitement of car chases or courtroom tactics. In general, it's a simple leisurely-paced story with well-developed character study on small town folks living in country style, with diagnoses as to how opposites attract, especially these pipe smoking doctors having more in common besides the use of stethoscopes.(*** surgical gloves).",

I'll stop there and just say that at just a little over an hour, there isn't too much in the way of excitement especially since nearly the entire thing seems to take place on a mansion but there are some good atmospheric shots and a few good suspenseful moments and also some amusing comic relief courtesy of no. 3 son Jimmy (Benson Fong), no. 2 daughter Iris (Marianne Quon), and, in his first appearance, chauffeur Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland, who isn't as outrageous as his later appearances in the series).

For one, Sidney Toler's depiction of Chan is more abrupt and almost mean spirited at times. Music is used more frequently, but seems out of place, as when a dramatic score is used when Chan casually strolls to a taxi. Offsetting these points is the introduction of two new members of the Chan Clan, the film now revealing there are fourteen! offspring. Benson Fong joins the action as Number #3 son Tommy, and Marianne Quon is introduced as Number #2 daughter Iris. Mantan Moreland also joins the cast as Birmingham Brown, although his character has not been fully developed at this point. \n\nThe mystery involves the murder of a World War II scientist and inventor who has developed plans for a new torpedo. The cast of suspects is a varied lot, and as Charlie closes in on the killer, the killer himself is murdered. Charlie uses a ruse to flush out the second murderer, but somehow it seems contrived, as there is nothing in the film to lead up to the second killer's identity. Other guests are built up to seem more suspicious, such as Paul Arranto, confined to a wheelchair but who can actually walk. It's as if one of Charlie's own lines in the film can be used to describe the solution - \"Explanation too perfect to be true\".",

Ranging from a talkative society woman to a grumpy Washington economist, a controlling South American politician who does all the talking for everyone in his party, a surly businessman who doesn't like to answer questions about his background, a no-nonsense housekeeper, the suspects run the gamut from average to pretty peculiar. Throw in the unwelcome \" help\" from two of Charlie's offspring, Number Three Son Tommy and pretty daughter Iris, and the reluctant assistance of Birmingham, plus assorted cops and federal agents, and this is a pretty lively household.\n\nIt's really not a bad picture, though arguably there's more plot and characters than truly necessary.

Monogram had already tried their hand at an 'imitation' of the series, the (not too impressive) 'Mr. Wong' films with Boris Karloff - but now they had the REAL thing in their hands!

More humor was added, more members of Charlie's family were introduced as his assistants, and Monogram regular, the great black comedian Mantan Moreland, became an almost indispensable member of the troupe.\n\nIn Monogram's first entry in the 'Charlie Chan' series, our beloved detective has joined the Secret Service - doing his duty for his country hunting down not 'ordinary' murderers, but dangerous spies of enemy countries. And he's assigned to the case of scientist Melton, who'd been working on a very effective new torpedo, and had suddenly died right in the hall of his own house where he was about to hold a dinner party - and the torpedo plans he had on him are missing... Charlie immediately suspects the international spy who's known only as 'Manlic', hoping to be able to lie his hands on him at last - and starts his investigations with the dinner party guests, who all really look MORE than suspicious...\n\nMeanwhile, number three son Tommy and number two daughter Iris are eager to help their Pop while Jimmy is away - and together with chauffeur Birmingham (who tries all the time in vain to get away from the scene of the crime), they make a marvelous trio of confusion that adds laughter rather than help for Charlie - and for us!

Assisting Charlie in a manner of speaking are two offspring Benson Fong as number 2 son Tommy and Marianne Quon as number 1 daughter.\n\nCharlie Chan In The Secret Service, the title does say it all.

At one of those parties he winds up quite dead with no outward appearance of homicide. He also would not allow any bodyguards inside the house. That was a bit much, the President of the United States can't override their presence much less a scientist.\n\nToler deduces first that it was a murder, second the method used, and lastly who did it. Then his culprit also is killed with a silent gunshot and Charlie then has to find the accomplice.\n\nThis was one of the only Chans at least in the Monogram films that had a wartime related plot to it. Amazing how many foreign nationals could get close to a scientist working on a government project with no kind of clearance. \n\nThe film has one very large red herring as the plot lets you in on a secret one of the suspects has.

The real culprit will surprise you though.\n\nThe character of Birmingham Brown is introduced who in two films later would wind up employed as the Chan family chauffeur.

First, Charlie Chan in the Secret Service features a couple of fairly elaborate murder weapons that would have taken some time to set up. But the killer was just a guest in the house. So when did the murderer get inside and re-do the electrical wiring to be able to commit murder? Second, Charlie Chan in the Secret Service has a runtime of only 63 minutes. But if you were to take out the numerous instances of padding, you might end up with a movie less than 45 minutes in length. The most egregious example is the scene where Chan leaves the Secret Service building. We see Chan walk down the hall, through the doorway, down the steps, wait for a cab, get in the cab, ride to his destination, exit the cab, and finally get inside the house. Alone, these scenes take a good two or more minutes and add absolutely nothing to the film other than stretching its runtime.\n\nI realize that most of the Monogram Chan films can't compare with what came before.

For whatever reason, Fox decided to stop making Charlie Chan movies in 1942. So Sidney Toler bought the rights and took the series to Poverty Row studio Monogram. This meant a lower budget, weaker scripts, and a generally less impressive cast. Opinions on the Monogram Chan films are mixed among fans. I don't like them much myself. The best ones are watchable and nearly all of them are forgettable. That this movie is considered one of the better Monogram Chans is proof of how weak the series was there.\n\nHere, Charlie is less likable than before and more of a grouch. Sidney Toler looks noticeably older and frailer than just two years prior. This could be due to the difference in quality between Fox's hair, makeup, and wardrobe people and that of Monogram. I'd be surprised if Monogram even had such people. This movie sees the addition of bug-eyed comic relief Birmingham Brown, played by Mantan Moreland. The previous Chan films had some comic relief, usually from Charlie's sons Lee or Jimmy. But their comedy felt organic to the stories and brought something to the table beyond juvenile humor. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Moreland. His character exists just to be the stereotypical cowardly black man who runs at the sight of his own shadow. This also marks the debut of \"Number Three Son\" Tommy (Benson Fong). Fong is a poor substitute for either Keye Luke or Victor Sen Yung. He's very drab. We get to meet Charlie's daughter Iris (Marianne Quon). I like her and wish we could have had her as Charlie's sidekick in this series instead of boring Tommy or ridiculous Birmingham.\n\nThe writing and directing is uninspired. The unnecessary comedy is NEVER funny and just detracts from the film building any kind of mood or suspense. The music is terrible and misused. An early scene shows Charlie exiting a building, walking to a cab, and riding to the scene of the crime. There's nothing exciting or suspenseful about this, yet the music used would make you think he was fighting for his life with an alligator on the wing of an airplane. Oh, Monogram!",

Street is less a foil than an aid to Mr Wong, allowing us to take the story seriously - although we can't be too serious. There are obvious red herrings, and sudden reveals of facts we didn't have. For all that, the Wong series came after the clunkiness of the early talkies had been worked out, and the acting is much closer to what we would come to expect from classic studio products.\n\nAlthough I always struggle with Karloff as a Chinese - unlike the Chan series, for some reason - I have to say the role he played got the job done.

Edwards' death itself is uniquely staged, as he takes a gunshot to the chest while participating in a parlor game with a roomful of party guests as witnesses, with no one the wiser until it's time to credit the players.\n\nWong is assisted in the investigation once again by Police Captain Sam Street (Grant Withers); this time around Withers plays it much straighter than the over the top, brash portrayal he gave in \"Mr. Wong, Detective\". Nevertheless, it's Mr. Wong all the way in solving the caper. In a clever ruse, Wong suggests that he will soon be in possession of Edwards' letter naming the killer, hoping to flush out the culprit. As the parties gather, Wong names the murderer and reveals the mistakes the killer made that led him to his conclusion. The killer is impressed, and even shakes hands with Wong before the police take him away! In a fitting finale, the real letter finally arrives, but the confident Mr. Wong no longer has need of it, and tears it up without even opening the envelope.",

It's no accident he's invited the great scholar and criminologist James Lee Wong as played by Boris Karloff to a reception that evening creating The Mystery Of Mr. Wong.\n\nDespite I think was a grammatically incorrect title and given this is a production from Monogram Pictures, this is not a bad mystery and very topical at the time. The news of the war waged on the Chinese by Japan was in the papers all the time.\n\nWhen the murder of Farley is actually committed it's during a game of charades where guest Grant Reynolds shoots Farley during a sketch and the man doesn't get up. In a manner worthy of Agatha Christie there are a whole host of subjects present at the mansion. It was just the killer's bad luck to do this with Wong present.\n\nOne of these days I'll be bowled over when I find out that someone actually decides to call of a planned crime when some famous detective appears unplanned on the screen. \n\nDon't these people go to the movies?",

But The Mystery of Mr Wong seemed visually more refined and just better executed in general. It does suffer from a surprising but rather underdeveloped final solution(much more could have been done to explain the reason behind the crimes) and Dorothy Tree's- a very elegant woman- at times over-emotive acting. However, where The Mystery of Mr Wong most improves on from Mr Wong, Detective is the look of the film and the pacing. The production values are not big-budget, but they are noticeably more refined in editing and photography than in its predecessor. The pacing also is much crisper and maintains interest throughout instead of having the odd lull. The music is jaunty and haunting that suits the atmosphere evoked really well, the dialogue is witty and thoughtful and the story has a good mystery and does it with a diverting atmosphere, good amounts of suspense and use of clues and a sense of fun. The film is solidly directed and the acting is mostly very competent, though only Boris Karloff is very good standard(what to expect from a great actor who made the most always of what he had?).

                "text": "Having a popular, first-rate actor like Boris Karloff in the title role of its Mr. Wong mystery series added an unaccustomed touch of class to poverty row studio Monogram's usual low-budget lineup of undistinguished programmers. The portrayal of the genteel Chinese detective must have likewise been a nice change of pace for the refined Englishman from the run of monsters and other sinister types he had been typically cast. Okay, so Karloff looked about as much like a Percheron ice wagon horse as a Chinaman. Let's just assume he was one of a those half-British Hong Kong Wongs. In any case he manages to project a convincing Oriental ambiance with only a minimum of makeup, while showing the maximum of sophisticated acting talent his fans have come to expect. Monogram seems to have responded by giving the Mr. Wong series the best staff and the biggest budget the financially disadvantaged studio could scrape together to support Karloff, who was a bigger name than they were used to having around.\n\nThe Mystery Of Mr. Wong, second in the series, is immeasurably better produced than the first entry. Nice sets, both interior and exterior, smart, well-lighted cinematography and tight editing complement William Nigh's sharp direction. A full-bodied, original score by Edward J. Kay enhances the drama, action, and suspense while setting the just-right mysterious, exotic, and sometimes spooky atmosphere. The Scott Darling screenplay is complex and intelligent with engaging, at times even snappy, dialog. It presents a classic drawing room style mystery. The principle murder victim is a cad hated by all, which makes practically every character a suspect. Clues appear and disappear, sometimes even falling out of pictures on the wall. Karloff gets a competent supporting cast including elegant, if not so well-known leading lady Dorothy Tree, polished, oft-seen character actor Holmes Herbert, and stalwart Grant Withers in his reoccurring role as tough cop Captain Street. The police in this one are portrayed as less overbearing and bumbling than in the previous entry -- perhaps there were complaints from the policemen's benevolent associations. It's a mixed blessing. While the cops here are more efficient and less disruptive to the cagey Mr. Wong's efforts to solve the case, they are inevitably and sadly less humorous. While those of the politically correct persuasion may complain about an Occidental playing the Chinese detective, these little movies nevertheless gave good employment to a number of Oriental supporting actors, notably in this one Lotus Long, as a maid who knows more than she should about the mystery, Chester Gan as the no-nonsense butler who tries to help the police, and Lee Tung Foo in a reoccurring role as Mr. Wong's efficient manservant. The producers of the series gave pretty Ms. Long parts in two other Mr. Wong numbers, including the leading lady role in Phantom Of Chinatown (1940).\n\nThe Mystery of Mr. Wong nimbly belies its cheap origins all the way through -- so well put together, intriguing, smoothly paced, and entertaining, it seems almost like an \"A\" picture, or at least a big studio a \"B\" production. Karloff is a delight. Viewing the first two movies in the set, has made the fifteen bucks I sprang for VCI's well restored two-disk album of all six Mr. Wong movies look like the shopping coup of the season. If you like off-beat little mystery potboilers that pack a load of entertainment into a short running time, then Mr. Wong is wight for you! Sorry, I couldn't resist.",

When Edwards is murdered during a charades game, there are suspects a plenty including Edwards' mistreated wife, the secretary who loves the wife, Edwards' lawyer and two shady characters who want to get the gem back from Edwards. The resolution to the mystery relies on Wong having information that wasn't previously shared with the viewer. This is somewhat unusual for having a very sympathetic character as the murderer.

The actual mystery is only moderately suspenseful by B-mystery film standards, but the film's lack of comic relief may appeal to those who dislike this aspect of the Chan films.\n\nAs for the acting, this film is unusual in that all the actors were good except for one whose performance really stood out from the rest--it was THAT bad. Dorothy Tree, who played the wife of the murdered man, was simply horrible. Every time she opened her mouth, she over-emoted and enunciated like she was in a diction class. When I checked her biography on IMDb I discovered two things--that she was a reasonably prolific actress AND that she was a singing and diction coach. That really helps to explain her performance as did a quote from Ms. Tree concerning the role of proper diction in advancing feminism--\"more resonance, clear speech and a better vocabulary.\" Well, sometimes more isn't better! \n\nA decent time-passer--provided you don't mind wading through Ms. Tree's impassioned acting.\n\nBy the way, the copy I watched clocked in at 70 minutes--2 minutes longer than the time listed on IMDb.",

                "summary": "Enjoyable, informative look at paratroopers beginnings",
                "text": "Although it gives a rather light-hearted treatment to the rigor of paratrooper training, this film has considerable value and interest especially for military and airborne history and development. The light- heartedness may be accounted for because of the newness of the paratroops in 1941, efforts to educate the public and military about airborne training, and intentional efforts not to scare recruits away. Its major flaw is in not showing the rigors of training. As a former paratrooper (from the Cold War years of early 1960s in Germany), I thought the easy-go-lucky atmosphere in this film was quite exaggerated. Indeed, reading accounts of the first test platoon and parachute units (some good online sources), informs that the training from the earliest was most rigorous and with considerable discipline.\n\nThe biggest difference noted in the training from then until now, is that enlistees were then going right into training to be paratroopers -- so, boot camp and infantry specialty and jump school were all rolled into one. This film is important to point out that bit of history in the time just before and during the war. But, since WWII, paratroopers have first had to complete 8 weeks of regular basic training (boot camp), then go to their specialty school for 8 weeks or more (infantry, artillery, communications, medical, etc.), and finally spend 3 to 6 weeks in jump school at Ft. Benning, GA. The latter depends on passing the very rigorous physical abilities test. One has three tries (weeks) to make it. If on the first try, jump school then is three weeks. One other note: the Army Airborne school also trains men and women who go into some other specialty fields and from other branches of the service (Special Forces; Long Range Recon Patrol -- it may be called something different now; Navy Seals; Air Force forward observers -- if they're still used, etc.).\n\nSome scenes that other viewers may find strange or questionable are important to have been included because they show things that really happened \u0096 in my airborne training and service, and that of two brothers and older and younger paratroopers I've met over the years. Two examples in this film were of men \"freezing\" in the door and not being able to jump; and of a jumpmaster giving a jumper a boost or shove out the door. The gun scene was overboard \u0096 I doubt it has ever happened; but, where the film was quite light otherwise, it may have served to show in earnest the early fear and reticence (anyone in his or her right mind at least has butterflies the first few times up) about going out the door. And, the \"yahoo\" reaction shown by two or three of the troopers after they have \"hit the silk\" is a true portrayal of the feeling of elation and somewhat wonderment of hanging suspended in the air and slowly floating to the ground.\n\nSome of the training from the earliest days (packing of one's own chutes, and individual jumps), as well as equipment, had changed by the late 1950s and early 1960s, to say nothing of the aircraft used for jumping (from C-47s, to C-119 Flying Boxcars during most of WWII, to C- 130s, to C-124 Globe Trotters, to the Jet transports of later years). Also, the jump chute design and parachute landing falls were soon changed from what was shown in the film -- to a roll, to prevent broken legs from stiff-legged landings. The 150-foot towers as well as shorter jump training towers with cables are in use today. \n\nAll in all, though, this was a very good film. Most likely, veterans and others interested in military history would not be bored by the repeated jumping scenes. And, I think the considerable cast of known actors for the time, with a fairly decent, if somewhat predictable story line, made it an altogether enjoyable film. I'm sure it brings a smile to any veteran's face \u0096 of any branch of service \u0096 to think that a recruit in boot camp or initial training would get a pass, or be able to go on a date with or visit a training NCO or officer's daughter. But that's part of Hollywood's license for fiction, supposedly to boost the entertainment value and/or box office take. For the historical and educational value, with a cast of good acting and lots of jumping, I score this fairly high \u0096 4 out of 5.",

                "text": "Just before the US entered WWII, quite a few patriotic films were made by Hollywood showcasing the various duties of its armed forces. Some (such as \"Caught in the Draft\" and \"Buck Privates\") were comedies others were not (\"Dive Bomber\" and \"I wanted Wings\"). But all were films with a message--it's patriotic and important to become part of these fighting units. \"Parachute Battalion\" is such a film and it debuted several months before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe film is about a small group of men who volunteer for the paratroopers. Not surprisingly, it's a scary proposition jumping out of airplanes and the film shows their progress through this school. There are four fellows in particular that they showcase: a brash All-American football player (Robert Preston), the son of the base commander who is keeping his identity secret from his follow soldiers (Edmond O'Brien), comic relief (Buddy Ebsen) and a guy scared out of his wits (Richard Cromwell). All must prove themselves as they progress through camp.\n\nSo why did I score such a routine with a very high score of 8? One reason is that the men are NOT uniformly perfect--one clearly cracks up and another is close. Such fallibility probably would have NOT been in the film had it been made once the US was in the war--and it adds to the realism. But the biggest reason I liked the film is that little stock footage was used and what was used fit seamlessly into the movie. All too often, crappy, grainy footage is shoved into such films--but here you actually see the actors doing much of the work. Overall, it is an interesting little film--and a nice chance to see a young Edmond O'Brien in an early starring role.",

The film lacks the characteristic jingoistic propaganda that one finds in similar movies which tell of training civilians to be part of a modern industrial army. This is most likely due to the fact that there was no official enemy during the filming. The movie was released just nineteen days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, much too early to include enemies even though there had been a recent declaration of war against Japan. The dialogue, the characters and the plot are standard issue. One finds the tough instructor, the frightened recruit, the benevolent commander, the misguided football hero, and the one attractive female that everyone wants to marry. Still the movie is worth seeing, even with its shallow dramatic moments. The most entertaining scene in the movie is the dancing of Buddy Ebsen, who plays hillbilly recruit Jeff Hollis. One wishes there were fewer practice paratroop drops and more dancing by Ebsen.  ",

Of course, just in case was can obvious foregone conclusion, so it was just a matter of time and circumstances. Reminding me of the later Pine-Thomas programmers that covered every part of military life without giving away military secrets. These war pictures were important for the parents of the young men going off to an unknown future, not just propaganda but important morale boosters as well.\n\nThe four young men going into the parachute battalion are as different as different can be. Cocky Robert Preston is the pompous joker of the bunch, while Edmund O'Brien is a commanders son who is a recovering alcoholic. Sweet faced Richard Carlson is a secret coward whose inner tension builds up to being revealed in the film's key scene. Future Jed Clampett Buddy Ebsen is playing a younger version of his hillbilly character, making him the comic relief. Aboard the train to training camp, they meet pretty Nancy Kelly and her gruff father (an excellent Harry Carey), unaware of O'Brien's struggles, but preferring him over the obnoxious Preston who takes an instant dislike to him as well. Is it any real surprise that Carey ends up being their trainer? \n\nMixing the description of parachute battalion training (through stock footage, training films and newly photographed sequences) and romantic complications, this is not bad, but oh so familiar. Of the four young men, O'Brien and Cromwell play the more well defined characters, while Preston and Ebsen are simply \"types\" and not really given story. Preston does lead a drill much like he would years later lead the boys band in \"The Music Man\", and Ebsen shows off his rubber legged dancing in one brief sequence as well. It all culminates in a faked battle sequence for training where Ebsen confronts the other soldier he has been searching for ever since the film began for seemingly ridiculous reasons. Absolutely worth catching, but definitely leaves the viewer wanting something a little more substantial once it is all over.",

Parachute Batallion comes down to pretty much the same thing, the only question is who will get Nancy Kelly.\n\nRichard Cromwell has an interesting part, something not in Buck Privates, a wise guy who looses his nerve.

Burke, Robert Barrat,just happens to be the superintendent of the paratroop unite that's he's assigned to. There's also football hero Don Morse, Robert Preston, who in him fooling around with the fairer sex has him engaged to two women at the same time that can put him behind bars for bigamy.

There's also the romantic angle with both Burke & Morse vying for the affection of \"Thunderhead's\" pretty daughter Kit, Nancy Kelly, whom \"Thunderhead\" want's to get hitched up with a real man, not a draft dodging collage wimp, like one of the soon to become paratroopers that he's training.\n\n****SPOILERS*** The film bolls down to the final parachute jump to become a full fledged US paratrooper with both Morse & Bruke missing the bus or plane and left behind from participating in the big jump to get their wings.

Stop me if you've heard this before.\n\nThis was released a few months before Pearl Harbor, by which point it was increasingly likely that we would be drawn into the war.

Except for Robert Arlen, who goes crazy, it's a lot of fun. The guys indulge in a lot of grabass with the sergeants and with each other. They have dances in the barracks. They sleep in pajamas. It's true, they weren't served breakfast in bed by pretty blond Swedish maids, as I was in boot camp, but it's one big festival.\n\nThey even get to court Master Sergeant Harry Carey's daughter because they have plenty of time on leave. The formula requires that there be a love triangle and here it is. Both O'Brien and Preston plan to marry Carey's daughter. They miss the big war exercise because they're busy having a fist fight. Instead of being railroaded into the clink for such an infraction, as I was in boot camp, a special chartered plane takes them up to make the prescribed drop, and the exercise is a great success.\n\nIt's not really necessary to get deeper into the plot. The most outstanding features have to do with make parachute drops. There is some interstitial footage of \"the first parachute drop ever made.\" And a good deal of time is spent on parachute rigging.

It's easy to scoff at all this and The Hays Code was in full swing but there's very little that resembles realism .

                "text": "One of the things that all of the films about Norway during World War II fail to mention is why the Nazis were there in the first place. All of the Scandinavian countries would have gladly sat out this war as they did World War I. In fact all, but Sweden got into it for various reasons.\n\nIn the case of Norway, it's simply the long Norwegian coastline. Even before the Soviet Union was invaded, Hitler saw the necessity of preventing supplies from getting to the Soviets should they break the Hitler-Stalin pact and enter the war on the allied side. The convoy route used was the one into the Arctic Ocean into Archangel and Murmansk. No other route was possible for American lend lease. The Nazis operated bases from Norway and sank a lot of allied shipping in the North Atlantic.\n\nSo this is why this small village and so many others like it were occupied and why the country was invaded. The Norwegian people from the king and queen on down, knew their country was in a sideshow theater, yet they did resist as best they could.\n\nIn fact Mr. Churchill did mount a counterattack in Norway, but the invasion failed and British troops had to withdraw. From time to time he brought up freeing Norway during allied conferences, but could get no support for it from Roosevelt or Stalin.\n\nErrol Flynn stars in Edge of Darkness and the usual Flynn derring-do is kept on hold. Probably in keeping with the stoical nature of Scandinavian character. He's not exactly Captain Blood in this one. He's a fisherman, but his natural qualities of leadership come through as he leads the resistance.\n\nEdge of Darkness is the story of one coastal Norwegian village who put up with Nazi occupation beyond what was humanly bearable. The rape of Ann Sheridan finally touches off a revolt.\n\nIt's not a star vehicle per se. Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan have a great deal less dialog than they would in most films. Edge of Darkness is a study of the various townspeople and the way each one of them deals with the Nazi occupation.\n\nWalter Huston and Ruth Gordon are the parents of Sheridan and John Beal. Huston is the town doctor and tries to remain above the battle. Gordon, like Patricia Collinge in The Little Foxes, retreats into nostalgia. Sheridan is a resistance member and Beal was an informer in Oslo, but only the immediate family know it at first.\n\nHowever the performance I like the best is Charles Dingle's. Dingle has always been one of my favorite character players ever. He's Gordon's brother, the owner of the cannery, and he quite deliberately chooses to collaborate with the Germans. He's the kind of villain you love to hate as is Helmut Dantine the commanding officer of the Nazi garrison.\n\nWe learn Dingle's fate at the beginning of the film and as the action unfolds in flashback the audience really rejoices in that fate.\n\nNo mistake about it, Edge of Darkness is a World War II propaganda film, but still entertaining today",

The cast is excellent, top-notch all the way: Errol Flynn, Ann Sheridan, Walter Huston, Ruth Gordon, John Beal, Helmut Dantine, Judith Anderson and Morris Carnovsky. Sometimes on the IMDb message board, a poster will ask for opinions on the best ensemble cast ever assembled. This one deserves a mention. It's probably not at the top of everyone's list because it was released while Errol Flynn was fighting statutory rape charges, which was a distraction to audiences, certainly, and also because it followed \"Casablanca.\" \n\nNorway was dragged into the World War II conflict because Hitler was very concerned about protecting the Norwegian shoreline so that the Russians could not receive supplies if they joined the Allies. In the story, the village is being occupied by the Nazis, who are taking the people's shipments of basic necessities and oppressing the entire town by their very presence - curfews, patrols, and the commandeering of the local hotel as their base. Flynn plays the head of the resistance, a brave fisherman named Gunnar Brogge. He is joined in the fight byand by other villagers and by the woman he loves, Karen Stensgard (Sheridan). Her father (Huston) is a doctor who, like many others, has been content not to make waves; his wife (Gordon) longs for the days before the war when the family was together. Karen, however, has no such wish - her brother, Johann (John Beal) is a weakling who collaborated with the Nazis in Oslo. Hearing that he's returning home, she warns the resistance group that he could cause problems. Meanwhile, the group waits to receive a shipment of arms so that they can fight effectively.\n\nThe director, Lewis Milestone, has created an atmosphere where one feels the oppression, fear and frustration of these simple people. There are powerful scenes that demonstrate the viciousness of the Nazis, led by Helmut Dantine. One scene is off-camera - the rape of Karen. As another poster here commented, she of course looks fabulous when she returns to the group - some dirt smudges and her beautiful hair falling around her face. That is really the one false note in this story of great bravery.\n\nThe entire cast is terrific, led by Flynn, who demonstrates quiet strength and determination as Gunnar. This is really an ensemble piece, however, and Flynn and Sheridan do not overwhelm the production. Walter Huston again demonstrates his brilliant acting skills as a man trying to stick it out without having a high profile, and Gordon is sympathetic as his wife, who yearns for the family moments that are now gone. All of the roles, including the smaller ones, are essayed beautifully.\n\nI am sure that this film was very inspirational when first seen, particularly the radio message from Roosevelt at the end of the movie. \"Edge of Darkness\" is a compelling story about the effect of the war and occupation on the average person.",

Younger viewers will probably be shocked that indeed movies were once made that extolled virtues such as self sacrifice, heroism, patriotism and courage against overwhelming odds. While the setting is in Norway, it reflects what America once believed. There is no political correctness here. Pacifists and collaborators are viewed as traitors. Tolerance for the invader is unthinkable.\n\nTold in flashback we learn that a small Norwegian village has been under German occupation for several years. The Germans routinely harass, abuse and generally ride rough shod over the locals whose tempers have reached the boiling point. The Germans feel free to take what they please while the inhabitants struggle to exist.\n\nSlowly but surely the villagers, led by Gunnar Brogge (Errol Flynn) began fighting back by engaging in acts of sabotage, defiance and even assassination. The Germans counter with ever harsher regulations and measures. After receiving guns from the British, the people rise up and engage their oppressors in a climactic battle of annihilation. Yes, there was a time when guns were recognized as instruments of freedom.\n\nThe performances in this film were outstanding. One can only cheer when Karen Stensgard (Ann Sheridan) proclaims \"To a free Norway\". Equally good performances were wrought by Helmut Dantine, Walter Huston and Richard Fraser. I particularly enjoyed Frasers transformation from a meek pastor who wants peace at any price, to a Tommy Gun toting avenger who saves the lives of soon to be executed hostages. Equally impressive is Hauptmann Koenig's (Helmut Dantine) wide eyed frightful exclamation, \"You didn't see them, they just kept coming and coming...\", when his headquarters is under siege.\n\nVery effective was the soundtrack which was dominated by the strains of \"A mighty Fortress is our God\".\n\nAs the movie concludes we hear the voice of FDR invoking viewers to \"Look to Norway\" if they doubt why we were engaged in that titanic endeavor known as World War II..",

                "text": "When I first saw this film a few months ago, I found it a bit tedious in places and its melodramatic elements laughable. However, I decided to view the film again recently and I appreciated the film all the more. Yes, it's Hollywood propaganda and the story borders on fantasy, but it's a thoroughly entertaining film once you're familiar with the complex story.\n\nThe acting, direction, writing, cinematography, and editing are all excellent. Under Lewis Milestone's atmospheric direction, all the performances are sincere and almost never forced--particularly Ruth Gordon, Nancy Coleman, and Morris Carnovsky in supporting roles, who are my favorite performers in the film. The writing is natural and the characterizations are believable enough. The film's most memorable aspect is the brilliant black-and-white cinematography by Sidney Hickox, relying on zoom effects, focus depth, tracking shots, close-ups, and many other imaginative devices in order to make this film entirely watchable from beginning to end. It's a pity that the cinematography did not earn an Oscar nomination. The film has the usual fast-paced Warner Bros. editing techniques that were a trademark of the studio's films at the time. The Martin Luther hymn \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\" is put to stirring use throughout the film's score.\n\nThe climactic town revolt is very exciting and Lewis Milestone's directing skills are up to his very best capabilities here. The actions sequences, while not graphic or bloody, are up the level of the best action-packed war films. It is an extremely suspenseful, visually compelling sequence that lasts almost a half-hour.\n\nHowever, there are drawbacks to this film. Franz Waxman, my least favorite classic film composer, adds a mostly forgettable and intrusively melodramatic score that's bound to provoke laughter rather than chills or tears. The film would've been better if Erich Wolfgang Korngold or Max Steiner offered their composing talents to the film and used a subtler score instead. Also, too many character situations make the story a bit confusing in places. One minor quibble is that Ann Sheridan, even after her character is raped off-screen by a German soldier, always looks glamorous no matter what happens. But despite these drawbacks, you'll be rewarded after the film is over.\n\nAll in all, this is a very entertaining Hollywood propaganda film that still holds up well today despite the melodramatic elements and bad timing of the film's release. However, the story of a fictional Norwegian town and how its citizens respond to the evil Nazi conquerors makes a very powerful, if a bit far-fetched, film concerning themes of fighting against oppression and loyalty towards one's country.",

This World War Two \"propaganda\" piece or morale builder rises far above its genre in the hands of the cinematic master best known for his magisterial World War One picture All Quiet On The Western Front. The story of a revolt brewing against Nazi occupiers by the people of a Norwegian fishing village, scripted by Robert Rossen, is reeled out in Milestone's fluid, sensuous cinematic style with spellbinding suspense from beginning to end. Sets are first rate, with the magic of Old Hollywood art transforming the California coast into a misty Scandinavian fjord.\n\nLeading man Errol Flynn turns in perhaps his best job of acting. His dashing image is completely lost in the role of a humble fisherman not entirely confident as the leader of the local Resistance movement. No dashing uniform here, just a pea coat and a plain merchant sailor's cap. And no mustache! Flynn and leading lady Ann Sheridan both turn in the solid, understated performances their roles called for, but it is a superb cast of supporting players that really shines in this one. One of the great charms of this memorable movie is the rich character development amongst the supporting parts. Walter Huston, as the town doctor trying to sit the fence, and Judith Anderson, as a Resistance worker hopelessly in love with a German soldier, are dominating as always. But the show is practically stolen by Roman Bohnen, as a henpecked, middle-aged store keeper with dreams of glory, and the ubiquitous Henry Brandon, as a suave SS officer who may not be all he seems. Helmut Dantine, a refugee Austrian anti-Nazi in real life, plays the German commandant with razor-edge ruthlessness. Likewise outstanding are Ruth Gordon as the doctor's sadly unbalanced wife, Charles Dingle as her Quissling brother, John Beal as her wavering Quissling son, and Nancy Coleman as the commandant's frightened Polish mistress. Monte Blue, Frank Wilcox, Art Bridge, and Morris Carnovsky add their always reliable presences. Thanks to consummate acting skill, Rossen's intelligent script, and Milestone's precise direction, you will come to know these characters as well as your neighbors by the shattering end of this two hour movie.\n\nFranz Waxman's florid score themed on Martin Luther's stirring hymn \"A Mighty Fortress Is My God\" with snatches from Wagner sweeps the action along to a rousing climax.Sid Hickox is credited for the sublime cinematography, but as I have stated elsewhere (see my review of The General Died At Dawn), Milestone's graphic statement was the same no matter who was behind the camera or in the editing room. Sweeping camera, silky smooth scene changes with creative dissolves, panning mise-en-scene were all the master's trademarks -- much imitated and highly influential on the film noir style that came to dominate pictures of all genres during the 1940's. Notice how at the beginning of the final scene in Edge of Darkness the flapping flag dissolves into a sheet of paper in a typewriter!\n\nEdge of Darkness is a classic of the war/intrigue genre and one of the great movies of all time.

The emotional impact is great--mostly due to exceptional writing, production values and a nice ensemble cast. I'm sure when audiences left the theaters, they often were energized and it gave them a sense that \"we're all in this together\".\n\nErrol Flynn is cast in the lead as a Norwegian patriot who is slowly and very covertly trying to plan for a rebellion against their Nazi overlords. Interestingly, while Flynn and the rest do not sport Norwegian accents, the film (and in particular, Flynn's performance) is generally understated. This helped make the film seem more realistic and heightened the emotional impact.\n\nIn addition to Flynn, the film also stars Ann Sheridan, Walter Huston and Ruth Gordon. However, unlike most Warner Brothers films of the day, the usual cast of supporting actors (Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Alan Hale and the rest) are absent. This was a good decision, as the usual \"comic relief\" style of support is --replaced with a gritty yet believable group of actors.\n\nWhat I also liked about the film was that while the Nazis were very brutal and evil, they were not quite so over-the-top as they were in many propaganda films of the day. Yes, they murdered and even raped, but the whole thing was handled more realistically than many films--the Germans were not parodied or ridiculous--making them all the more scary.\n\nThe film ends with a terrific final confrontation scene between the Norwegians and the Nazis. It was very deftly filmed and was super-exciting.\n\nAll in all, this is one terrific film--mostly due to realism and excellent performances all around--from direction to sets to writing to acting to cinematography.

Edge of Darkness, though it has the elements that make watching films of this era irksome i.e. pulling grenades with the teeth, only the good guys suffer wounds,stirring speeches for the home audience,it is Milestone grim. The German garrison dies hard taking a heavy toll of villagers, the retaliation their comrades will impose on some hapless Norwegians will be brutal. Juliet Anderson and a German corporal almost share what would be in another, post war film, a romantic relationship but she is filled with patriotic revenge and the lonely corporal becomes a reluctant victim of national resolve similar to what happened in the almost similar film The Moon is Down's ill-fated romance. Errol Flynn is the embodiment of the Noble Cause the other performers play recognizable types stepped on or used by the Enemy. The final battle almost mirrors how WWII eventually ended, with a gradually dwindling,but still war hardened professionals succumbing to the citizen soldiers of the Allies, whose armies had by 1943 become proficient while the Fuhrer's started their decline collapsing into old men and boys leavened with a war weary soldatens trying to stay alive.",

                "text": "My review title is, of course, a take on the Warners film released 2 years earlier: \"They Died With their Boots On\", also starring Errol Flynn, as G.A. Custer, and featuring the annihilation of his cavalry command by a confederation of Native Americans attempting to defend their treatied homelands against the illegal invasion of swarms of gold seekers, who generally considered the N.A.s a much inferior race of 'savages', justifying their virtual annihilation, if necessary. Sound familiar? In this powerfully dramatized film, it's the Nazis who are playing the role of Custer and the gold seekers, who feel justified in overrunning the traditional territories of their neighbors, with the ultimate goal of replacing these peoples, considered genetically inferior, if not raving savages, with their own offspring. As in the case of Custer, the natives(Norwegians) have an advantage in a sizable numerical superiority and greater familiarity with the territory, if a marked disadvantage in armaments.\n\nFulfilling its wartime purpose of encouraging public support to help defeat the Nazis, the film strongly suggests that, with sufficient outside support in smuggled armaments, 'resistance' groups in Nazi-occupied regions might be successful in significant sabotage and passive resistance projects, making a significant contribution toward the ultimate unraveling of the Nazi empire. The film ends with the locally victorious Norwegians trudging off into the forest near their fishing village, fearful of Nazi reprisals for their annihilation of the sizable German garrison, and presumably planning further sabotage operations until the Germans leave. Accompanying this visuals, we hear a historic FDR speech, featuring the plight of the Norwegians, along with a stirring final rendering of the recurring Luther hymn \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\" in the background, making the resistance against the Nazis seem more like a 'holy war' against the forces of evil. \n\nThis is the only one of the 5 war-propaganda films starring Flynn released by Warners during the war that was not directed by Raoul Walsh. Lewis Milestone was born to Russian Jewish parents, who emigrated to the US when he was a teen. Thus, it's quite understandable that he relished the directing job of several anti-Axis films during the war. As with the present film, \"The North Star\" emphasizes the hopes and activities of 'resistance' groups within Nazi-controlled regions. The highly acclaimed \"A Walk in the Sun\" looks at the war from the myopic viewpoint of the ordinary soldier. \"The Purple Heart\" dramatizes the incarceration and trial of a group of American fliers captured by the Japanese. Like the fanatical Nazi Captain Keonig, in the present film, the fanatical Japanese commander involved commits suicide in the end: his indoctrinated assumption of what American servicemen are like, and the myth of the invincibility of the Japanese armed forces, shattered.\n\nVery ironically, Helmut Dantine, who plays Captain Keonig, imbued with the standard Nazi assumption of racial superiority, was the former leader of Vienna anti-Nazi activists, forced to flee to the US, winding up in LA. He played a similar role in several other wartime films, including \"Northern Pursuit\", where Flynn again plays his chief nemesis.\n\nThe film begins with a Nazi patrol plane (which looks like a slightly modified Lockheed Hudson light bomber, used in several Warner wartime films) observes a Norwegian flag flying over a coastal German garrison, instigating a patrol boat to investigate. They discover the gruesome sight of hundreds of German and Norwegian bodies strewn all over outside and inside the compound and adjacent fishing village. Otherwise , both seem deserted , except for one deranged Norwegian, who is promptly machine-gunned. We will see a similar sight near the end of the film. Meanwhile, the remainder of the film consists of a flashback to events leading up to this massacre.\n\nThe bulk of the film consists of characterizations of a spectrum of responses to the Nazi takeover: from outright cooperation with the Nazis, to uneasy neutrality, to determined passive and/or active resistance. Some change their position during the film. Another major section deals with the secret acquisition and hiding of armaments from a British submarine: part of a British plan for a coordinated uprising of all coastal towns against the local Germans. This plan is articulated by a British spy(played by Henry Brandon), as one of the garrison Germans. The last part of the film deals with the actual armed revolt. Although many Norwegians die, some seem immune to the German machinegun fire.\n\nFlynn's character, as the leader of the local resistance group, is named Gunnar, as was the most famous leader of Norwegian resistance(Gunnar Sonsteby), tales of his activities having already reached the outside when this film was scripted... Glamorous-looking Anne Sheridan, as Gunnar's gung-ho 'resistance' girlfriend, makes the most convincing romantic partner for Flynn in his 5 war-propaganda films...Nancy Coleman, who played an anti-Nazi German and Flynn's fleeting romantic interest in the previous \"Desperate Journey\", here plays the 'kept' Polish mistress of the collective German officers, who mocks them when they are facing annihilation, being shot in response...Richard Fraser plays the conflicted pastor: advocating non-resistance, but firing the first shots of the showdown, when the 'resistance' leaders are about to be executed.\n\nThere's so much more to this film, but I'm about out of space.",

But this is a serious movie about bravery and the sacrifices that so many made in the war. The story doesn't call for lightheartedness. It's one of the best war movies Flynn or WB made.",

After two years under German rule , a small Norwegian fishing village rises up and revolts against the occupying Nazis . A fisherman (Errol Flynn) along with his loyal fianc\u00e9e (Ann Sheridan) leads the local (Walter Huston , Ruth Gordon , Judith Anderson and several others) underground movement against a Nazi nasty captain (Helmut Dantine). The second part is quite starkly moving developing account of deeds that befall about the villagers and when they go into action.\n\nA surprisingly very strong version about Norwegian resistance with career-best interpretations from Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan . With a spectacular opening reminiscent of 'Beau Gest' , the film gets action , pretty downbeat deeds , intense drama with moments of extraordinary power and breathtaking final battle . Although numerous problems happened throughout shooting , this movie contains impressive images and submitted performances . Director tries to expose war for what it is and not glorify it . Very well camera work by cameraman Sidney Hickock . Thrilling and evocative musical score by the classic Franz Waxman . Rating : Above average , the flick earned big high marks for its superb scenarios , credible acting and dramatic scenes .\n\nThis War/drama is compellingly directed by Lewis Milestone , he was born in the Ukraine , but emigrated to America at 18 and he served in WWI becoming an assistant director on Army training films . Then War returned and Lewis was in thick of it with several fictional movies and a documentary . He often made chronicles of wartime conflicts and persisted in showing horror war from the point of view of the ordinary soldier . Milestone was using what he felt were the best means at his disposal to express his own philosophies about war in particular . Milestone's niche in movie history is secure with his War films and it is on these pictures that his reputation rests . As he showed WWI , winning Academy Award for \u00a8All quiet on the western front\u00a8 , and WWII such as \u00a8Purple heart\u00a8 , \u00a8Halls of Montezuma\u00a8 , \u00a8Edge and darkness\u00a8 , the best of which is \u00a8A walk in the sun\u00a8 with remarkable intensity at times and Korean war as \u00a8Pork Chop Hill\u00a8 ; and directed several others excellent movies in different fields , dramas as \u00a8Of mice and men\u00a8 , Noir cinema as \u00a8Strange love of Martha Ivers\u00a8, adventure as \u00a8Mutiny on the Bount\u00a8 and heist-comedy as \u00a8Ocean's eleven\u00a8, among others.\n\nThe picture is set during German invasion of Norway and subsequent Nazi conquest , the historical events are the following : The invasion began on April 9, 1940. The German Navy and Airforce led the operation . The Hitler plan relied on surprise to avoid interception by the British and to prevent Norwegian forces from mobilizing. The sudden appearance of naval task forces took Norwegian defenders by surprise and allowed airfields around Oslo , Tondheim and Stevenager to be captured by the German intact. German forces at Trondheim advanced and linked up with forces in Oslo. Norwegian forces in central and southern began to surrender. In northern Norway British and French troops fighting against Germans in Narvik . But the Allied decided to pull out of Norway , evacuating forces from Narvik . After that , Nazi conquest was completed with help some collaborators as the famous \u00a8Quisling\u00a8 who was a Norwegian prime minister whose collaboration with the Nazis meant his name became a term meaning traitor and in this film is represented by the Walter Huston , Ruth Gordon's son , John Beal .",

Some of them can only be excused by the need to convince Americans to win the war at all costs. Others, like Casablanca, will be ranked as among the greatest movies ever made as long as people watch movies.\n\nThe Edge of Darkness isn't on a level with Casablanca, but it's not far short of that. The director, Lewis Milestone, had made such great movies as All Quiet on the Western Front and The Front Page. He directs this movie, blessed with a largely great script, with a brilliance and power that is second to none. By the end, even the most convinced pacifist will be clamoring to kill as many Nazis as possible. Even Casablanca and Mrs. Miniver do not stir up a hatred of the Germans the way this does. Like Leni Riefenstals' The Triumph of the Will, this movie shows how passions and hatred can be evoked outside all reason - a very frightening thought.\n\nBut everything in this movie is good. Errol Flynn has to act - there is no swinging from vines here - and shows that indeed he can, aided by his magnificent voice. Ann Sheridan, often dismissed as a very attractive pin-up girl, holds her own in the woman's acting division against such powerhouses as Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon, both of whom turn in masterful performances. Walter Huston is his usual impressive self, as are all sorts of \"character actors\" who, given real characters to develop here, show just why they are great actors: Morris Carnovsky, Charles Dingle (who has given so many great performances, as in The Little Foxes), even Virginia Christine, who later went on to be Mrs Olson for the Folger Coffee commercials. Because this script is so well written, even the \"little people\" become outstanding individuals, developed to their fullest by great performers.\n\nIt's fairly predictable until the scene when the local schoolteacher is almost killed by the Nazis in public. From the revolt that that triggers through the end of the movie the movie rises to a level of mastery that can't be beat. This movie must have had an overwhelming effect on Americans during the war. Even today, it takes a hold of you and controls your thoughts and feelings no matter how hard you try to resist.\n\nSo then. One part Cascablanca, one part Mrs. Miniver, one part The Triumph of the Will, and a lot of just great direction and acting. If you haven't see it, make sure that you do. And make sure you have lots of Kleenex.",

Gunnar isn't as overt as Flynn's Robin Hood or Captain Blood, but this is not surprising considering that he act secretly due to a ubiquitous Nazi presence in the village. Flynn is however, still effective in another of his heroic roles. Two other important villagers are well-played by veterans Ann Sheridan and Walter Huston. Helmut Dantine is notable as the zealous Nazi commander and as is Charles Dingle as an opportunistic village business leader that labels himself as a \"man of facts\" and collaborates with the Nazis.\n\nWhile there are some interesting themes, characterizations and scenes like the church scene in the film's first half, the first half as a whole is somewhat plodding. The film's second half is stronger as the Nazis tighten their grip on the village and the villagers mount their opposition. There is a touching sequence in this part of the film where Morris Carnovsky, as an older villager, confronts the Nazi commander on principle and is treated maliciously. In all parts of the film the blaring and marshal score helps to develop the tension the Nazis create.

EDGE OF DARKNESS reminds us that there are things worth fighting for, and that it's not shameful to unite against an oppressor, in this case the Third Reich.\n\nThe deftly-written script pulls us into the story slowly, as two German airmen wonder why a Norwegian flag is flying over a town supposedly overrun with Nazis. We're then presented with a mystery: why is this town covered with dead bodies? Why is the Nazi commandant sitting at his desk with a bullet in his head? The scriptwriter then unravels the mystery scene by scene until a very stirring climax.\n\nI am not an Errol Flynn fan and couldn't care less about his private life, so I was not bothered by seeing him in the lead. He gives a very restrained and believable performance as the head of the Norwegian resistance. The supporting players are almost uniformly fine, and the script manages to give us nice character scenes without losing the thread of the plot (for instance, the teacher confronting the commandant and refusing to let the Nazis occupy his house). As others have pointed out, there are moments of sheer melodrama, but director Milestone keeps things moving and helps us to care about the characters.\n\nThe only drawback for me was the phoniness of the models used in several places, such as the little toy boats in front of the mock Norwegian backdrop. The town and the buildings look fairly Scandinavian; unfortunately Adolf and friends made it impossible to shoot on location. This is another excellent war picture about how common people stood up to the enemy. I would also recommend THE HIDING PLACE and THE TRAIN as other classics in the genre.",

Because of it both being by Turner Classic Movies AND had one film directed by Lewis Milestone (with one of the finest anti-war statements ever made, 'All Quiet on the Western Front', under his belt) and the others by none other than Raoul Walsh, I was, pardon the pun, 'in like Flynn'. But as Flynn had been one of my favourite actors of the period simply on the basis of 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', I honestly would have gone for it anyway. Yeah, you could say I love older movies! =)\n\nMy best friend Earl remarked, 'By the end of WWII, they used up all of the good film titles,' and he probably has a point there, at least with this one, still getting quality usage THREE generations later, and with Mel Gibson to boot. But this was weird for a war film (looking at the resistance put up by a village of 800 Norwegians) bizarrely cast (with Ann Sheridan, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon--all as the GOOD guys!), and had taped speeches by BOTH Churchill and Roosevelt. I read notorious British film critic Leslie Halliwell's review that everything was decent about the film except that it starred Flynn. He couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nI'm greatly looking forward to examining the other four films of the set, all directed by one of the most underrated American directors of all time--Raoul Walsh.",

An excellent example of war propaganda, this masterful Warner Brothers drama is spared no detail in fighting against Hitler's machine of evil. Leading the way are rumored real-life Nazi spy Errol Flynn and \"oomph girl\" Ann Sheridan who shows that amongst her loveliness, she was also quite a good dramatic actress and had a truly wonderful spirit. Flynn is the leader of the resistance, a seemingly peace- loving fisherman who has no fear of losing his own life if his homeland can regain its freedom and the nasty fifth columnists all drowned with the help of the many fishing boats docked on their beautiful shores.\n\nSheridan is the daughter of the town's beloved doctor (the always excellent Walter Huston), a peace-loving man who is against the resistance simply because of fear, but circumstances slowly change his mind. He's married to the quiet and wise Ruth Gordon (long before the days of her campy old ladies), and is looked up to by the town. Others highly involved include the local innkeeper (Judith Anderson, playing a wise, courageous and decent woman, a far cry from her many evil film roles) as well as other businessmen who don't want their livelihoods spoiled by the intrusion of these evil invaders. Some agree with the plan to fight, some want peace (particularly the local priest who must weigh his conscience later on as the situation worsens) and others want action immediately. Huston's family has its own issues with Gordon's factory owning brother (Charles Dingle) the biggest quisling of them all, an influence on their college age son (John Beal) who is exposed and banished.\n\nOf course, with any film dealing with wartime propaganda, at times, it is going to seem melodramatic or over-the-top, but the war years were filled with many tragic elements that fortunately didn't touch American soil outside the Japanese detention camps. The hard-working European farmers and merchants suffered greatly at the hands of German and Italian invaders, so there is no need for subtlety. Other movies have presented similar themes (my other favorite being 1940's \"The Mortal Storm\"), but \"Edge of Darkness\" is certainly one of the most riveting with its brilliant characterizations and often nuanced portrayals even of individual Nazi's. Case in point, Judith Anderson's love for a German soldier that isn't presented as betrayal, but does create conflict for her in the fact that the invasion of their town took her father's life. For this reason, she has become sort of a \"Madame DeFarge\" like character, although in this case, she isn't as vile. Her affections for both Flynn and Sheridan add a charming touch to her tough on the outside, pure sentiment on the inside, character, and for me, she's the most interesting of all the villagers.\n\nOn the Nazi side, there's Helmut Dantine as the invading captain, a mess of a man who can't bear to listen to the anti-German tirades of various townspeople, particularly an aging professor whom he listens to as if he knows its the truth but just can't face it because of some sort of doomed destiny. He has a Norwegian mistress (Nancy Coleman) who is ill defined as a character, and I cringed a bit when she makes her final statement starting with \"I would like to make a speech\". Another apparent Nazi is really an ally plant who risks his life several times in his efforts to help the townsfolk. When tragic circumstances strikes Sheridan, Huston takes things into his own hands which culminates with a seemingly deadly result, and by this time, the Nazi's are worse monsters than anything that came out of Universal's stable of creatures. \n\nExcellent direction by \"All Quiet on the Western Front's\" Lewis Milestone holds everything together, and the screenplay by future director Robert Rossen (based on a novel by William Wods) is brilliant with only a few minor exceptions. Sid Hickox's photography is striking, and the music by Franz Waxman draws the viewer in emotionally from the time the opening credits roll. I only had issues with some of the cut away photo shots between the resistance and the Nazi's which made it seem that they were closer to each other than they obviously were. I could just see this being played in the movie theater in 1943 with audience members hissing every time the Nazi's did something despicable and large rounds of applause when they got their come-uppance. For that reason alone, this stands the test of time, because every time I have watched this (which has been many), I find myself wanting to do the same thing.",

The film was a contribution by Warners Bros to the Allied war effort, and is so stirring that if people didn't rush off to enlist as soon as they left the theatre then they would have at least bought a stack of war bonds. \n\nThere is a lot of movie magic in the film. Location footage was combined with scenes shot on the sound stage with a great deal of miniature work thrown in. This mixture gives the film a somewhat mythical quality; we are drawn into the isolated, almost claustrophobic world of Trollness, where the battle, physical and ideological, is fought between the Norwegians and the Germans.\n\nThese days we accept Errol Flynn as a far better actor than was probably acknowledged back then when his activities in the bedroom seemed to blur any appreciation of his talent. He underplays here and is very believable as is Ann Sheridan.\n\nHowever, Helmut Dantine stole the show as the commander of the German garrison. Dantine could 'master race' with the best of them. Hollywood had some very effective actors who specialised in playing Nazis, but Dantine could out-heel click, out-Heil and out-face slap any of them. Although Nazis of that era could never be portrayed sympathetically, Dantine created a complex character, seemingly on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nThe most memorable sequence in the film is the uprising at the end. Much of the action is filmed with the same brilliant tracking shots Milestone used in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" especially as the Norwegians advance against the German machine guns or fight them hand-to-hand in the streets.\n\nThere are many dramatic speeches in the film. A number of characters espouse ideas that probably weighed against the screenwriters a little later in the McCarthy era. After all, the biggest traitor in the film is also the major symbol of capitalism \u0096 the wealthy owner of the local cannery.\n\nThe battle was also fought in the film's music. Franz Waxman counterpoints soaring renditions of Norway's national anthem and hymns with bursts of \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" \u0096 all adding to the richness of the film.\n\nI can imagine this would have been an uplifting film to see during WW2. Even now it's hard not to get a lump in the throat as the Norwegians break into song in defiance of the Nazis.

In telling its tale, the strong script introduces us to pretty much every type of character (and therefore attitude toward the fight against Nazism) it is possible to imagine. There is Walter Huston's kindly doctor who is unsure of the wisdom of an armed revolt (but slowly brought around to the cause), his feisty daughter (Ann Sheridan) and her fisherman boyfriend (Errol Flynn) who are at the forefront of the resistance, his son who, having once been seduced by Nazi rhetoric finds himself unable to break away from them now that the scales have fallen from his eyes, the cheap tramp who collaborates with the Nazis before seeing the light, the cowardly shopkeeper who overcomes his fear of his German tormentors, the wise (but misguided) schoolteacher who mistakenly believes one man making a stand can make a difference, and the kindly matriarch who simply wants to go to bed later like she used to.\n\nYou'd think that such a roll call of characters might result in something formulaic, but writer Robert Rossen knits together the various strands of the story in such an accomplished way that you are drawn in from the start. Having being made in the midst of the war, the Nazis are nearly all portrayed as stereotypical drunken baby-eaters, although the plot does briefly touch upon one exception, who has tender feelings for a widowed housekeeper. Nevertheless, Hollywood law decrees that he must meet the same fate as his comrades because the only good Nazi's a dead one \u0096 and all Nazis are cowards at heart.\n\nFor all the familiar tropes of its genre, this Lewis Milestone film stands head and shoulders above most other films from this era, simply because it makes you care about the characters and delivers just as much action as it does propagandistic speeches.

Topping all of these scenes is the final voice-over by no less than F.D.R. praising the Norwegians for their stance against occupied Norway while \"A Mighty Fortress\" builds up on the soundtrack. Franz Waxman's background score is frequently as melodramatic as the on screen action.\n\nBut still, the last forty minutes of the film are comprised of some of the most powerful scenes and gives the whole story the kind of stature it deserves for the final climactic battle scenes.\n\nSumming up: Worthwhile film is gripping at times but weakened by occasional lapses of melodramatic excess, in typical '40s style.",

This movie is technically proficient, attractive-looking, and well-acted by a very good cast. It is a very good example of this kind of movie. It holds your attention for the most part, except that it does get dialog-heavy, with some windy speeches that substitute for action. It does come across as heavy-handed cheerleading and it does at times become mindless and overdone propaganda after awhile. But some of this owes to the necessity to dramatize the conflict, how the Norwegians felt, and the horrid Nazi philosophy. It can be forgiven, and not least because some of the partisan speeches are very well written. In 2015, we cannot judge 1943 properly without looking at the big picture, and it looked very bleak for the occupied peoples. Warner Brothers joined or supported the war effort by making pictures like this.\n\nThe story is fiction. It is not representative, as far as I can tell, of the actual workings of the Norwegian resistance. It is meant more to depict the spirit and solidarity of the Norwegian people and to depict the Nazi philosophy of the master race. The latter is embodied in the one-sided militaristic figure played by Helmut Dantine. The former is depicted thoroughly by focusing on a number of characters and not any single protagonist. Moreover, the story shades its portrait nicely by bringing in a fascist sympathizer (the owner of the local canning factory), a cowardly turncoat (until he warns the villagers), a pacifistic preacher (until he takes up a machine gun), a doctor on the fence (until he joins the armed resistance), and several others who have reservations about fighting the Nazis openly by use of arms. But in the end, the struggle becomes a fictional pitched open battle of lighter-armed greater numbers of villagers who lack military training against a smaller contingent of well-armed and well-trained Nazis.\n\nThe movie captures the resentment of Norwegians to the occupation, some of the Nazi misdeeds and some of the nature of living in a country policed by occupiers who impose their own rules and kill in retribution for sabotage. It captures some of the cross-currents and varied opinions about how to deal with the Nazis. At the same time, the type of resistance depicted is unrealistic and the movie doesn't show the actual kinds of resistance that occurred.\n\nViewed artistically on movie terms, although I would like to feel this movie as one that depicts real people in a real struggle, and although the capable cast valiantly does its best to create this illusion, the script doesn't help them accomplish this. It constantly imposes dialog and roles upon them that tend to thwart this kind of depiction. In addition, apart from one main quisling who goes mad(!), the village people all become larger-than-life self-sacrificing persons willing to make a suicidal frontal assault.",

However, I think he is very good as one. He provides his usual heroic performance, albeit more understated than normal, and shows the sort of determination that many people were showing in real life at the time to defeat the Nazis.\n\nThe ending is good especially when the German captain played by Helmut Dantine shoots himself. I believe this was meant to portray the fact that a devout Nazi, as Dantine's character was, was so shocked that the Nazis could be defeated by anybody that he couldn't take it so had to commit suicide. This was meant to show that by fighting back against the Nazis they could crack.\n\nAn undoubted propaganda film made at a time when the war was still not definitely decided I thought it was very good at getting the message across that there was at least light at the end of the tunnel in the fight to rid the world of Nazism.",

                "text": "\"Edge of Darkness\" is a film built around the meaning of the word \"quisling\"--one who collaborates with the enemy--and the fact that the word comes from an infamous Norwegian. The story is about a Nazi-occupied Norwegian fishing village during WWII. Since Hollywood produced this film in 1943, it is not surprising that, like all films of the era, it succumbs to propaganda in place of authenticity.\n\nBut this film goes completely overboard in its attempts to dramatize the philosophical differences between those who choose freedom versus those who seek to conquer. This is a film of caricatures. At times it has a noir style, but the leaden delivery of the dialogue sinks this film. If you read about the problems that plagued this production (see the trivia notes), you can understand how the performances might be compromised. Ruth Gordon, whose performance I enjoyed the most, said she hated the film.\n\nOne major problem is the musical score, which is even more heavy-handed than the script. I have a feeling that the book might be a good read, but its translation to film is over the top. There are some well-written speeches that feel out of place in this corny rendition of wartime resistance. There are many films that do it better, particularly with regard to the French resistance. Or how about \"Casablanca\"?\n\nMuch of the dialogue in this film is laughable, because it forces the characters to say things no one would ever say. \"We are soldiers, soldiers of our Fuhrer. These are rebels. They must not win!\" I really don't think audiences in 1943 had to be convinced that the Nazis were morally in the wrong. Yet films like this continued to beat them over the head with simplistic pleas that draw the Germans (and Japanese) as evil, sometimes even subhuman, people.\n\nI believe the story is meant to be about bravery and loyalty. It is somewhat successful at that, but the overall film sinks under the weight of its own overdone propaganda.",

Hauptmann Koenig, Helmut Dantine, is found behind his desk with a self inflected bullet wound in his skull. This obviously in an attempt by the Captain to prevent himself from being taken alive by the rebellious Norwegians and made to face the music.\n\nIt's then that we get this almost two hour flashback to what lead up to this mindless slaughter of what looks like the entire town and the German garrison in it. Capt. Koenig felt that his ability to lead man in battle had been squandered by his higher up in the German Military High Command by being put in this little nothing town on the Northen Norwegian coast. Wanting to see action on the Russian Front the Captain was always turned down by his superiors from being stationed there. This made Captain Koeing very pi**ed off but unable to take it out on those who screwed him, the German Military High Command, he took it out on the local peaceful Norwegians.\n\nCapt. Koenig abuse of the people of Trollness lead them to go so far as getting involved with the British in having them, through he Royal Navy, get loads of arms ammunition and explosives in order to drive the hated Germans out. But what they really needed most was the will to do it, drive the Germans out of town, and be willing to suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen the and the people of Trollness just had their fill of Capt. Koenig and his men they lead by Norwegian freedom fighter Gunnar Brogge, Errol Flynn, broke open the boxes of guns and ammunition that they got from the British and planned to have the German run out of town once and for all. It's wasn't until after Gunner's girlfriend Karen Stensgard, Ann Sheridan, was assaulted and raped, off camera, by a horny German soldier who had the hots for her for some time that he finally got it, and the men and women of the town, all together and revolted against the Germans.\n\nIt's when Gunnar himself and the leaders of Trollness were rounded up and forced to dig their own graves by the Germans that had the townspeople lead by the peace loving father of Karen Dr. Stensgard, Walter Huston, and town towns ultra-passive Paster Aalesen, Richard Prasen, take to the streets.\n\nWhat's makes \"Edge of Darkness\" a cut above your average war-time propaganda movie is that it keeps the action off the screen until the last fifteen or so minutes. When the fighting finally breaks out the good guys, the freedom fighting Norwegians, are for the most part the ones who get the worst of it by the much better armed and disciplined German troops. What makes the Norwegians succeed is that their more then willing to die,unlike the Germans, for both their ideals and freedoms. The Norwegians use human wave and suicide tactics, totally disregarding their lives and safety, like attacking the Germans with live hand grenades, exploding themselves together with the German troops, in order to drive the hated Germans out of Trolless.\n\nAn irony in the movie is that the two Quisling in it Kasper Torgerson, Charles Dingle, and is nephew Johann Stensgrad, John Beal, Karen's and Dr. Stensgard brother and son die different death one fighting against the Nazis and the other sucking up to them. Johann having a change of heart risks and eventually gives his life alerting the Norwegian freedom fighters, lead by Gunnar Brogge, that the Germans are waiting in an ambush that they set up for them. Kasper survives the slaughter of Trollness only to get shot, as he rants and raves like a lunatic, by the very Germans whom he sold his people and country out to.",

But after a while I began to notice how crazy this Norwegians are for giving speeches. Everything is told in long, declamatory sentences about how they will fight and the will win and they are willing to risk death and all that. This may have been very stirring in the midst of WWII and it may be very good as propaganda but it is terrible as film making.\n\nSome moments were particularly absurd. A man goes to the Nazis and makes a long speech about how he has rights and of course he gets predictably beaten up for it. This is extra stupid because he knows perfectly well that the Norwegians has a cache of weapons and are just waiting for a signal from England to start a mass uprising. Even more stupid is when a Polish girl forced into prostitution by the Nazis starts a speech to the soldiers just before the climactic battle. She gets shot, of course, but if she'd just stayed in her room for another 15 minutes she could have been freed.\n\nI watched this movie because I'm a big fan of Lewis Milestone, the director, but this is far from his best work.

Day died in the 1930s, but a play by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse was produced from the books entitled LIFE WITH FATHER. It played for nearly a dozen years or so, and for many years had the record of Broadway performances before the coming of the super musical hits from OKLAHOMA onward.\n\nLIFE WITH FATHER is set in 1885 (the historical reference that sets this date is the rant by Mr. Day at the newspaper, where he refers to the then Mayor of New York, \"Honest Hugh Grant\" and Tammany Boss Richard Croker). The story line is actually quite straightforward - the senior Day (William Powell) faces the daily problems of his household, thinking he is running things but constantly being out-witted by his dearly loved wife Vinnie (Irene Dunne) who insists on having an ugly ceramic pug dog for awhile. Accidentally Mr. Day reveals that his free-thinking parents have never had him baptized, and this horrifies his wife and their local minister (Edmund Gwenn). Being a man in his late forties now, Powell thinks it is absolutely foolish to make him get baptized now. In the meantime his oldest son Clarence (Jimmy Lyden) has met with the first love interest of his life (his mother's cousin, young Elizabeth Taylor). Clarence's brother John, who is interested in science (he has wired up the parlor to cause a bell to go off, that confuses Mr. Day no end), has gotten involved selling a patent medicine. This will have ill-effects on Mrs. Day and Mr. Day, culminating in an oath that Mr. Day will end up regretting. Finally there are some marvelous examples of home economics from Mrs. Day that baffle and confuse Mr. Day no end - watch how she takes back the pug dog (which was charged) and gets a \"free suit\" for Clarence (\"THEY DON\"T GIVE AWAY FREE SUITS!\", Mr. Day insists.]\n\nI doubt, unfortunately, that a book, play, or movie like LIFE WITH FATHER would last today. And I think we are the poorer for that. It is of a long dead world, with a fierce devotion to order and stratified social life in our homes and in our cities and nation. But it was not without it's charms. Catch the sweetest moment in this wonderful movie, when Mr. Day and Vinnie are singing \"Sweet Marie\" together in their parlor, on a summer afternoon.",

                "text": "As an adult, Clarence Day Jr. (1874-1935) joined his well-known father on Wall Street--but developed a form of arthritis that left him a semi-invalid. Shortly before his death he published LIFE WITH FATHER, a humorous memoir of his Victorian childhood; sadly, he did not live to see its great success. A best seller, the novel was adapted to the stage in 1939 by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse. Warner Bro.s bought the film rights, agreeing to wait until the show finished its Broadway run; as it happened the studio had a long wait, for the play went on to become one of Broadway's longest running shows, playing almost eight years.\n\nIn acquiring the rights, Warner Bro.s also gave Clarence Day's widow and playwrights Lindsay and Crouse substantial power over the film version. Censorship issues of the day prevented an absolute translation of the script to the screen, but on the whole the script survived the transformation extremely well, and fueled by a host of flawless performances and remarkably fine production values LIFE WITH FATHER became as memorable on screen as it was on stage.\n\nClarence Day is an eccentric man, absolutely certain that he alone is correct in all decisions, and eternally running afoul of wife Vinnie's scatterbrained logic, his four sons, visiting relatives, and terrified servants. When a conversation reveals that he has never been baptized, Mr. Day laughs the matter off--but Vinnie is determined that he will be baptized whether he likes it or not. Comic battle-lines are drawn, and the result is a hilariously amusing portrait of Victorian manners and attitudes about everything from religion to the place of women in the world.\n\nThe performances are superlative. This would prove to be among the last great roles for both William Powell and Irene Dunne, who play Clarence and Vinnie Day, and to describe their work as flawless is actually an understatement: we completely believe in them from start to finish. The same is true of the cast in general, which includes a remarkably beautiful Elizabeth Taylor; legendary comic ZaSu Pitt; and even a very young Martin Milner. The costuming and sets also capture the look and feel of the era in remarkable fashion. The film is perfectly executed from start to finish.\n\nBut you might as well throw your money away than buy any of the releases presently available on VHS and DVD. There is not a one of them worth a dime: the color is atrocious, the sound is horrific, and the picture so blurry that the only thing you'll get for your money is a headache--and this has been true of every factory release I've seen to date.\n\nIt is a terrible shame that such a fine, indeed such a great film has been so incredibly neglected. Fortunately for all concerned, LIFE WITH FATHER continues to turn up on television fairly often. Until there is a restored release, don't buy a VHS or a DVD: tape it from television instead, for I can almost guarantee that the version you find there will be superior.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

I'm almost afraid to see it for the third time, as I could almost dislike it again since I seem to flip-flop on this.\n\nTHE GOOD: The film has \"charm\" written all over it. Although Irene Dunne has some Grace Allen-type gag lines, William Powell is the one who provides most of the laughs in this tale of upper-crust family life in the 1880s. However, both Powell and Dunne are excellent and play off each other well. The story revolves around the personal and business life of the Clarence Day family, a true family in the sense of the word it, which is nice to see. Every character is interesting and the supporting cast includes Edmund Gwenn and Zasu Pitts (love that name!). Nice Technicolor, too.\n\nTHE BAD: The romance between Jimmy Lydon and a young Elizabeth Taylor gets a little sappy. Powell's constant exclamation \"Gad!\" is very annoying as a close as screenwriters apparently could get to saying \"God\" all the time in 1947.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice period piece that takes you back life a little over a century ago, and provides us another one of these more-innocent family stories. To my knowledge, there has never been a good print made of this, either on tape or DVD, which doesn't make sense considering the fine cast and good reputation of this movie.",

                "text": "In his third and final Oscar nomination, William Powell was nominated for playing the bellowing and lovable 19th century domestic tyrant Clarence Day, Sr. in Life With Father. If he had to lose I'm sure Powell was glad it was to his very good friend in real life Ronald Colman for A Double Life. Still with that strange flaming red hair on top of his familiar features, Powell imprints his own personality on the leading role of the longest running play on Broadway up to that time.\n\nBased on the recollections of Clarence Day, Jr. as played by Jimmy Lydon here, Life With Father ran for eight years on Broadway for 3447 performances. It was brought to the stage by Howard Lindsay and his two partners, writing partner Russell Crouse who adapted Day's work to the stage and life partner Dorothy Stickney who with her husband got their career roles on Broadway. The play ran from 1939 through 1947 taking America right through World War II. The time that it was written and presented to the public may account for its popularity as the public might just have wanted reassurance of American values at that critical point.\n\nAs Lindsay and Stickney had no kind of movie box office, Warner Brothers decided to acquire William Powell for the lead and cast Irene Dunne as the wise mother who has learned just the right way to handle her husband and inevitably get what she wants. Powell is a man who thinks when all else has failed, he can bellow his way through any situation. My favorite line in the play is when he tries to hire a maid and that title quote is when he's asked for references.\n\nWarner paid a lot in loan outs for this film. Irene Dunne was not a contract employee of his studio and Elizabeth Taylor was also borrowed from MGM for the small, decorative part of a cousin that gets Jimmy Lydon and Martin Milner's hormones in an uproar. The part that Taylor plays was originated on Broadway by another future film star, Teresa Wright.\n\nIncidentally Martin Milner reminisced many years later about the film and said of all the boys and of course Powell, he was the only natural redhead among the lot.\n\nEdmund Gwenn fresh from an Oscar himself for Miracle on 34th Street plays the Episcopalian minister who is trying to get a large contribution from Powell for a new church. Their discussion is also a highlight of the play and the fact that Powell had never been baptized is also a subject of a lot of humor.\n\nFather still had life well into the Fifties with a television series adapted from the play that starred Leon Ames as dear old dad.\n\nThe play, the film still have a lot of character in it.",

In general, Hollywood period pieces from the 40's and 50's can be a bit too cornball for my tastes (not that that's a BAD thing, it just depends on what kind of mood you're in).  But I gave this film a shot and I was pleasantly surprised.  There are some genuinely hysterical moments here.  And while the introductory storyline tends to drag just a bit, the true comedy soon emerges from the intermingled sub-plots.        I think that the reviewers who have panned the film may have missed the point of it entirely.  The character portrayals of the parents are cartoonish for a reason.  Did you notice how the children are drawn in a slightly more three-dimensional light?  It's because this film is, essentially, a satire.  The reason the \"folks\" are so nutty is because the story is being told from the perspective of Clarence Day Jr. (at least, that's how it was originally written).        What this movie attempts to do, and accomplishes in spades, is to poke a bit of fun at the uptight, button-down aristocracy of 19th century America.  We have the excitable, self-absorbed, and completely delusional patriarch, and the neurotic, long-suffering, and religiously impressionable mother.  This film rips the facade right from its hinges, and shows us what people were really like.  The firm and omnipotent father is actually a stubborn but hen-pecked hypocrite.  And his wife is no better!  She schemes, plots, and manipulates to constantly gain control of her heel of a husband.  And, quite admittedly, she usually succeeds.  The kids are the only *normal* ones (except for an EXTREMELY annoying Liz Taylor, who plays her role like she's in a High School production of Guys & Dolls).      Overall, a very funny film.  Some of the dialogue is sparkling and hysterically clever, a model that modern-day Hollywood would do well to study and live up to.  There were several laugh-out-loud moments here, and I wasn't even in a good mood!  If you like the old obscure Hollywood gems, check this one out!

Powell, best know for his work with Myrna Loy in the \"Thin Man\" series of films. Powell uses every second of this plum role to display his charming style and verbal acuity.\n\nThe story is simple: Powell and his wife, played by Irene Dunne, face a series of calamities, some serious and some ridiculous, mostly brought on by their four rambunctious, red-headed sons.  After a visiting cousin brings along fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Taylor, events are put into motion which threaten to turn Powell's neatly-ordered world upside down.\n\nThe performances are uniformly fine, and Powell and Dunne are absolutely sterling.  A supporting cast that includes Zasu Pitts, Edmund Gwenn and early appearances from Martin Milner and Elizabeth Taylor round out the picture quite well.  If there is anything to detract from the complete enjoyment of the film, it is Taylor's performance, which can get grating, but hey, she's just a kid, and when you look at her, you can already see the amazing beauty still to come.  The exceptional visual style of the film makes you long for the day when people rode in horse-carts to Delmonico's for dinner.\n\nWatch for some classic dialogue between Powell and Dunne over the cost of a new coffee pot, between Powell and his son about \"the facts of life where women are concerned,\" and the nonsensical wordplay over the return of a Porcelain Pug-Dog.\n",

Ms. Taylor becomes a romantic interest for Mr. Lydon, who wasn't sure he liked girls before her arrival.

In fact, it held that record for nearly three more decades until it was finally dethroned by Fiddler On The Roof.  (Source: turnerclassicmovies.com)\n\nAs it was such a huge hit, it carried with it an astronomical price for the film rights - $500,000 plus half the profits.  That's more than Selznick had paid for Gone With The Wind some eight years earlier!  (TCM again)\n\nStagey?  Not at all surprising, considering the above.  When you pay that much for something, you (usually) don't muck around much with the plot.\n\n\nBut even if Warner's HAD wanted to change anything, contractually the playwrights and Clarence Day, Jr.'s widow held veto power over any changes. (TCM)\n\nAs for the play, it was based on Clarence Day, Jr's book, Life With Father, itself a huge best seller.  Powell plays Clarence Sr. much as he's portrayed in the book (I've read it) - if anything, he tones down the blustery elder Day a bit.\n\nFinally, some have commented negatively on the primness and propriety of the family's dress and decor.  Folks, we need to remember that  a) this is set in New York City in the 1890s, and  b) this is a very wealthy family we're watching.  Society was still rigidly divided by class at the time.  In a wealthy NY household, formality was very much the norm; as was ignoring the hired help as they performed their duties.  ",

This type of attitude pays a tow on his wife (Irene Dunne) as well as his five children but things take a dramatic turn when the wife finds out that he's never been baptized. I'll say right off the bad that this here is a very good movie but I wouldn't come anywhere close to calling it a masterpiece or one of the best of the decade, which seems to be something that a lot say about it. Again, this isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but I just don't feel it lived up to its reputation. With that said, there's still a lot to enjoy here and I'm somewhat shocked that the film works as well as it did considering there's really not too much to its plot. We basically have a rather stern father making life somewhat tough on everyone around him but slowly by slowly the wife begins to get her way on several things including charge accounts. It's rather funny to think that a film's main selling point is a man needed to get baptized so that he doesn't burn in hell. In fact, there's a rather funny scene where one of the brothers is torturing the other one by saying daddy is going to burn. The performances are certainly what makes the film with Powell turning in one of the greatest pieces of work in his career. I really thought he did a fantastic job becoming this character and not once did you see Powell playing him but instead you feel as if you're watching a real person. Dunne is just as effective, although in a different way as the wife who is made to suffer. The supporting cast includes a lovely Elizabeth Taylor as well as Zasu Pitts in a funny role. For a \"comedy\" this film really doesn't have many laugh out loud moments but it's more of a laid back comedy that has a few natural laughs here and there. Director Michael Curtiz does a very good job with his work and again, I'm really surprised that the film worked as well as it did considering its slow pacing and slim story. LIFE WITH FATHER isn't a masterpiece but the performance by Powell alone makes it a must see.",

                "text": "He thinks he's king of the roost, but the queen is really the power behind the throne. Father is William Powell, as far from the delightfully drunken Nick Charles as he can be, and mother is Irene Dunne, whom second to Myrna Loy could be called the woman every man would love to come home to. Yes, mother may be sweet and apparently submissive, but that's only for show. Behind the scenes, mother knows how to work father so she can get him to do precisely as she wants him to do, especially be baptized! She can passively/aggressively manipulate him without his even knowing it, and she sweetly grins in the all-knowing fact that she has him where she wants him and he still thinks he's in control.\n\nThat's the subject of this delightful version of the longest running play in Broadway history, colorfully made into a film as if it was a Currier and Ives magazine spread come to life. Once you meet father, you can't help but love him in spite of his imperious attitude, so stiff upper lip you'd swear he was British, not a New Yorker. Powell makes his pompous character very relatable, and with the fact that he's basically a fool unknowingly controlled by his wife, that makes for delicious payback. That's why there ended up being a sequel for Broadway called \"Life With Mother\", because she's really the ruler of the roost, allowing him his pride by making him think he's really the one in command.\n\nPowell and Dunne are surrounded by a wonderful cast which includes a very young Elizabeth Taylor as a young lady who visits with Dunne's dizzy aunt (Zasu Pitts) and upsets older son Jimmy Lydon who just doesn't understand women. Martin Milner (\"Adam 12\") is recognizable instantly as the second oldest son, while Derek Scott and Johnny Calkins round out the roles of the younger children. I couldn't help but find it humorous to imagine Powell's imperious Clarence Day siring children who here are under 10 years old. Powell's imperiousness with his children covers everything from oatmeal to a new suit for the oldest son, and with his wife such trifles as a rubber tree plant and a porcelain dog. \n\nThe same year he won screen immortality as Santa Claus in \"The Miracle on 24th Street\", Edmund Gwenn played another spiritual figure, here the Episcopal priest who is aghast by the fact that one of the congregation's top members has refused to be baptized. This makes the plot seem almost absent, but the whole slice-of-life atmosphere is so delightfully presented and charming, you never realize for the most part that you are watching a two hour movie with basically no story. Then, there's the comical subplot of Powell's imperious attitude over the maids who come and go just like Murphy Brown's secretaries decades later. One maid runs out in horror after crashing down a flight of stairs as if she's just encountered Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff in a darkened corridor.\n\nEven with a very serious director (Michael Curtiz) at the helm of this light-hearted picture, everything moves smoothly, and the art direction of the Day house is simply divine. The film also takes the family to the famous Delmonico's Restaurant for a trip into vintage New York high society. Such great character performers as Emma Dunn, Elisabeth Risdon and Clara Blandick pop in for some memorable bits. While the play may not hold up well on stage today, the film takes the audience back to an era of grace and manners long gone from one of the greatest cities in the world.",

Thin on plot, long on charm and whimsical humor, the Broadway play is given a lavish, technicolor treatment under the steady direction of Michael Curtiz. Father's bombastic ways turn the household upside down on more than one occasion, with an ever changing number of maids frightened by his thunderous \"Oh Gaaaad!!\"\n\nDue to censorship demands of 1947, his final line in the movie had to be changed. When asked by a policeman if he is going off to his office, the original line in the play was, \"No, I'm going to be baptized, dammit!\"  Imagine, back in 1947, \"dammit\" was forbidden on screen.\n\nThe movie's perfect casting is marred only by one performer--Elizabeth Taylor as Cousin Mary gives what is probably the worst of her early ingenue portrayals. The role itself is bland as written but Taylor makes it far worse with her irritating--almost insipid girlishness. Sugary sweet. Hard to believe this is the girl who would one day mouth the dialog of \"Virginia Woolf\".

A time when \"the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood\" in England & Europe, & \"the Heidelberg school\" in Australia, were struggling to broaden the horizons of their audience, against much opposition from conservative thinkers in their respective worlds. \n\nThey portrayed the marginalised, the downtrodden, the romantic, the heartbroken & the visionaries, with colourful & dramatic aspects to their characters, of their contemporary or by-gone portraits! We see it here in their contemporary world, with self-righteous \"father\" called into question if not derision, his know-all mentality casting a deep shadow on those he loves. So too, in the religiousness beyond him, that impacts on him, through the family & those they interact with. And their values. The rest of the family, especially his wife with inverse logic to his business sense from her isolation from the rest of the world he interacts with, manages to successfully call into question this by heartful abstraction that her son broadens in his request for a suit. From abstraction, into reality ... via a pathetic purchase of extravagance & insignificance! That's not to mention family decision-making on \"women's complaints\" & appropriate compensation for dead dogs. \n\nThis really is a magnificent piece of masterful development that the playwright who created this, was not privileged to have developed in his life-time! There's more, like the minister with his hollow dimensions & perspectives, those that interact with William Powell's family, from relatives to customers of a snake-oil salesman connection! \n\nIt's all here! And what's more, it presented with humour & much insight into the natures of each character portrayed! \n\nI read all of the reviews available on the IMDb site at the time of my viewing.

It has one of my favorite comic actors of the 1930s, William Powell, but makes him so pompous and loud and ill at ease, he has lost all of his wry charm and genuine humor. Not that he jokes or even tries to be comic here, but his role (as the \"father\" in question) is offputting.\n\nThe sons are frankly bad actors in bad roles, too, cardboard, smiling clich\u00e9s. The visiting girlfriend is none other than a young and fresh Liz Taylor (she's fifteen here), and she brings life to some scenes just as often as she overacts others. The upper crust New York household with its rules and with its whole family about to burst from all the restrictions (poverty not one of them, for sure) is not really funny. The filming is static, the camera stable, the light garish, and the color (Technicolor) egregious (everyone has red hair, it seems). Even after an hour I was still wondering what exactly the whole point of it was. Can we really just be waiting for the girl to hook up with one of the sons, as the father rants in strident tones about the price of a coffee pot?\n\nNo, we can't. What makes the movie work is the building of familiarity with the characters, so their humor, their occasional warmth, and the real, unfunny events later on have their effect.\n\nThe lead character's wife, played by Irene Dunne, is a relief, though she can't save every scene any more than Taylor can. Director Michael Curtiz is known for making scores of reasonable but not especially memorable movies, but hey, he made one of the best, Casablanca, and one of my favorites, Mildred Pierce. This is more typical, sadly. The story is based on the true childhood memories of the American writer Clarence Day (of no fame other than this material, which was a huge Broadway hit before the movie was made). \n\nSo I go back to where I started--this really might be funny if you have a different take on it all, or you don't find Powell grating in his role. It clips along with lots of yelling, so maybe if you like Carol Burnett you'll be okay. Ha. Seriously, relax and accept the characters for something very different than we expect 130 years later, and everyone will grow on you.",

                "text": "The film, based upon the life of Clarence Day Sr., a governor on the New York Stock Exchange in 1883, AND the longest running non-musical Broadway stage play at the time, received only three minor Oscar nominations: Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography and Score, though William Powell (in the title role) earned his third and last Best Actor nomination. Despite an outstanding leading actress performance by Irene Dunne, as Day's spouse Vinnie, neither Dunne nor the picture received Academy Award nominations.\n\nWhile some may dismiss Life With Father (1947) for its dated (to the point of archaic) expressions and attitudes about life, they should remember that it was quaint at the time of its release. Indeed, it's a time capsule of pre-turn-of-the-century New York, when men were the unquestioned heads of their nuclear families; or were they? In fact, as bombastic and outspoken as (Powell's) Day is, he is in fact manipulated in subtle ways by his wife (Dunne's) Vinnie, whom he loves dearly. On the surface, Day is in charge of the money and every household decision, many of which he makes demonstratively by loudly proclaiming his dominance while often belittling his wife's lack of sound logic. Vinnie, however, while she respects her husband's traditional position and accepts that he has a superior intellect, doesn't passively allow herself to be bowled over by him. She sticks to her principles and even wrongheaded notions in a 'forceful' yet nonthreatening way \u0096 though perhaps a little too frequently by crying \u0096 such that \"Clare\" (for Clarence), out of his love for her or sometimes just exasperation, has to give in.\n\nThere are hilarious scenes concerning the family finances which begin with Vinnie humbly having to ask for money or explain her spending that leave Clare confused and Vinnie with the cash or her desired result: a porcelain pug dog is returned to pay for their son's new suit of clothes. This \"battle of the sexes\" scenario is then transferred generationally when a \"puppy dog romance\" develops between Clarence Jr. (Jimmy Lydon) and visiting Cousin Cora's (Zasu Pitts) traveling companion Mary Skinner, played by 15-year old Elizabeth Taylor. After a lesson about the need to \"be firm\" with women from Clarence Sr. \u0096 a priceless scene, that immediately precedes one in which Clare follows the advice he'd just given his son with Vinnie, telling her \"it's for your own good\" when she cries \u0096 Junior tells Mary that she must write him the minute she returns home from her visit to New York. But having been properly schooled, Mary of course is determined to have him write to her first; she strikes a balance between using her tears and her will to get her way. Like Clare, who doesn't know what he said that brought his wife to tears, Junior is also clueless that he's been manipulated, and he enthusiastically starts to write his first letter to Mary even before her horse cab has left their street. Outwardly, the males have the authority but it's the females that wield real power, something that's not really confined to the 19th century.\n\nThe other major storyline that demonstrates \"who wears the pants in the (Day) family\" has to do with the revelation that Clare has yet to be baptized. Vinnie is convinced that her husband won't be able to enter Heaven without correcting the situation, the sooner the better, and enlists the support of their children and the Reverend Dr. Lloyd (Edmund Gwenn). But Clarence Sr. is adamant that he doesn't need to be baptized, saying \"They can't keep me out of Heaven on a technicality\" and \"if there's one place the Church should leave alone, it's a man's soul!\" Upset - or \"stirred up\" as Clare would say - over her husband's eternal life, Vinnie falls ill, which is made worse when her entrepreneurial sons, Clarence Jr. and John (Martin Milner's screen debut), put \"Bartlett's Beneficent Balm\" \u0096 a 'miracle' cure they've signed up to sell \u0096 in her tea, thinking it will help with her \"women's complaints\". But their mother then really does become ill and the normally prudent Clare spares no expense to get Vinnie well, even promising her that he'll be baptized if she'll just pull through. When she does, he tries to excuse his actions and the argument continues, but in the (literal) end, as always, Vinnie gets her way.\n\nA couple of other odds & ends worth mentioning: one of the ways that Clarence Sr.'s eccentricities are conveyed is through the continuous flow of maids that the family goes through; he inadvertently scares them into quitting or fires them for incompetence. Even when he tries to intervene in his wife's affairs by hiring a replacement, Vinnie lets her go because the maid's outfit doesn't fit her. There's also a curious physical gesture that one of the maids does after exclaiming \"a redhead\" each time she notices the hair color of the Day's children; she licks two fingers on her right hand before slapping them, and then her fist, into her left palm. \"Oh Gad\", I almost forgot, some of the expressions such as this favorite exclamation of Clarence Sr. are priceless, including falderal \u0096 akin to poppycock \u0096 and \"confound it\".\n\nMichael Curtiz directed the Donald Ogden Stewart screenplay, which transformed the successful play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse \u0096 based on Clarence Day Jr.'s memoir \u0096 into movie sets for some scenes and dramatized others that were only referred to in the play. Rounding out the credited cast: Emma Dunn played the Day's longtime cook Margaret, Moroni Olsen played Dr. Humphries, Elisabeth Risdon was Mrs. Whitehead, Derek Scott was the Day's youngest son Harlan who adopts a dog and Johnny Calkins their third oldest Whitney (had to learn his catechism), Monte Blue was the policeman, Frank Elliot was Dr. Somers and Heather Wilde, Mary Field, Queenie Leonard and Nancy Evans were the string of maids.",

LOUIS--in fact, it's very easy to mix up the three movies). The cast of supporting cast members is very impressive, with Irene Dunn as the loving and long-suffering mother, Liz Taylor and a very young Martin Milner as two of the many kids, AND Edmund Gwen and Zazu Pitts to round everything out.\n\nThe film's major controversy turns out to be \"why hasn't father become baptized?\" and it seems that dad hates organized religion and the family is worried he'll spend eternity in Hell. And, ultimately, being the 1947s, it'd pretty obvious where this will go. However, it's not the plot that is the reason to watch the film--it's the journey itself with all the great characters and writing.",

Those who will appriciate this film the most are those who have grown up in a household with a father like Mr. Day (as I have). Other notable aspects are the stunning set design of a 1890's New York Row house and the sometimes hilarious screenplay. A favorite scene is one where Mr. Day is faced with the \"birds and the bees\" speech with his son.\n\nThis is proof that an intelligent G-rated comedy is possible.",

It is however a very predictable film, with little in the way of plot, and for each individual event it is easy to predict what will happen. The jokes are lame and some aspects are simply silly, but one can argue that the film paints a good picture of the times and religious values. William Powell certainly keeps it bright, playing an eccentric old-fashioned man, although Elizabeth Taylor overplays her role. The acting is not the best part of the film but instead the colour cinematography - it is quite well shot. This film is not nearly on the same level as Curtiz's 'Casablanca' but it is not a terrible film either. Perhaps slightly dated and hardly spectacular, but not too poorly done.",

                "text": "This film speaks to us today in modern day life and how far we have declined as a society. The power of our civilization rests on the bulwark and strength of family life. Since the decadence of the 60s and 70s we are facing economic ruin since our currency does not have gold anymore to back it up against the forthcoming imminent economic collapse that may come sooner than we think. Just look at gold and oil prices. There is no stability there. They are gauges indicating a fever pitch of troubles that lie ahead. Which leads me to William Powell. He was the Alan Greenspan of his household and he was representative of most households worth anything in 1883 New York. No credit and no electricity. Bills to be paid off at once. It was no accident that he was a Wall Street Privateer. If things were run today with the precision of his household the world would be in a lot better shape than it is. Yes, Irene Dunne, the mother, ran the household as she should. But it was the backbone of strength displayed by the \"O Captain My Captain\" of Clarence Day Sr (as told in Clarence Day Jr.'s story) that keeps everything financially above water. He had too hard a way of earning his money to have it squandered recklessly without accounting for every penny \"which is what the household accounts are for.\" Liz Taylor is good as are all the characters. The tender moments of marital bliss expressed by his gift of a Tiffany diamond ring for his wife is beautifully rendered on screen like a \"Moonlight Sonata.\" The religious theme of the mother endeavoring diligently to make sure that all of them get to heaven by ensuring the proper baptism of her husband reflects the truth of society at that time. That wealth was not a right or a privilege but was something that had to be earned through hard work and the right knowledge. The touch of Buck Ewing hitting a home run put a light on the \"new\" game of baseball and an early reference to baseball in heaven. (\"Field of Dreams\"). The way the father relates how he will organize a baseball team of their own in heaven before his son joins them up there shows the strong faith they had in the Christian afterlife. After all he was an \"Episcopalian.\" I think this film portrays the late 19th Century in New York accurately and reflected positively what it took to run a decent and successful household. The time it was released in 1947 was right after WWII which was a time when people started to go back to church because of the horrors just recently endured. I fear it may take another depression and global conflict (only it will be worse this time) to get society back on track morally and to help us show respect for one another. This film hearkens to the way things \"oughtta be.\" Great film.",

Incredibly, most of the movie is spent trying to persuade the father to be baptized for fear he will burn forever in hell.  The stagy production and cornball humour do not much help.

On the other hand Sally Benson's reminiscences of her life in turn of the century St Louis ran in the New Yorker sans words and music much as Clarence Day's hard-cover reminiscences of his own parents so the comparison holds. The forties were particularly rich in this kind of nostalgia and also included I Remember Mama. All require a certain amount of good will if one is to view them today but those who are able to surrender to the charm on display will be rewarded with a good old-fashioned wallow in a world without angst where a feisty heroine was a shot in the arm that wasn't addictive. Irene Dunne plays against Powell as well as Myrna Loy and trivia buffs will welcome the chance to catch Martin Milner in his debut. A decent print and we'd be off to the races.",

He is a one-namer (like \"Cher\") that looks like a slightly skinnier Oliver Hardy and manages to use a wide variety of facial expressions and body language to convey so much emotion. When his heart is broken by his philandering wife, you really find yourself feeling for the guy! Overall, it was extremely well-acted and well-written and I strongly recommend it. However, be forewarned that the videotape by Interama Video Classics is VERY poor quality AND they use white subtitles that are often very hard to read. I don't know why, but almost EVERY French film from the 1930s I have tried to watch on video is almost unwatchable due to the degradation of the print. I'm not sure why this is, but it could easily turn people away from classics like this movie, and that would be quite a loss, as Marcel Pagnol who wrote this film was a true artist and master of his medium.",

Welles is no slouch himself and many there are, including myself, who consider his own Citizen Kane to be in the all-time No #1 spot but, let's face it, old Awesome knows a thing or two when it comes to judging celluloid. This is, of course, a Marcel Pagnol production which presupposes several things; it will be set in the South of France barely a Long Shot from Marseille and it's twelve to seven to feature Raimu heading an ensemble cast of Pagnol regulars. So it is here with Raimu as the eponymous baker who has barely sold his first batch than his wife takes it on the Jesse Owens with the local stud. The smiles, if not outright belly laughs, on the faces of the villagers freeze pretty damn quick once they realize that no wife equals no bread which means that they set about locating and returning the wife. End of (very simple) story. But as someone once said it's the way you tell them and Pagnol has Scherezade beat seven ways from the middle; once again as in his celebrated trilogy (Marius, Fanny, Cesar, in case you just got here via a wormhole) he evokes an entire community with just a few strokes of the pen or, in this case, lens, so that what we have is a lovingly painted portrait of a small town not a million miles from the one Jack Ford devised for The Quiet Man and complete with a richly assorted set of residents. The closing scene where the errant wife ignites the fire in the oven may be a tad symbolic but when it occurs in such a warm film who cares.",

All the interest is the characters and their dialogue. And, despite very good performances by several of the supporting characters, this film achieves greatness because of the dialogue Pagnol gave Aimable (the baker) and the way Raimu delivers it. A mixture of the most moving pathos and the funniest comedy, the Baker is one of the great characters in film. (Trust me, the chapter in Giono's novel that served as the ostensible \"inspiration\" for this story is negligible. The genius is all Pagnol's.) The scene that every Frenchman knows is the last one, when Aimable takes out his anger at his wife's infidelity on their cat, Pomponette, but that is an atypical moment in this movie. It is all about Aimable's suffering, at the hands of his wife but also as a result of the way the town treats him. And Raimu conveys that suffering as only the greatest actors have: with understatement.\n\nMarius is funnier and has greater variety of character. But La Femme du boulanger shows what a great director and screenwriter can do with great actors. Movies get no better than this.",

It has a childish innocence over it, like basically all these typical genre movies from the '30's seem to have.\n\nIt's atmosphere, story and characters make this a very pleasant and entertaining movie to watch. It has a very simple concept, in which a French baker's wife run of with a shepherd, after the first night they moved in to a small village, in the middle of the countryside. After this the baker refuses to make bread anymore. The villagers of course want their daily fresh bread so they together come up with a plan to get her back to the bakery. It all sounds very simple but thanks to its fine storytelling from director Marcel Pagnol it all works out real well. There also is of course more to the story, courtesy of some fine input from the movie its characters and actors portraying them.\n\nIt's a well cast movie, with French character actor Raimu in the main lead. The other cast members all have some very characteristic look over them, the way only the French can look. I'm not too happy about the casting of Ginette Leclerc though. She is supposed to be a very pretty woman in the movie but just look at the way Leclerc look...she is no natural beauty. Or perhaps her looks just were the idea of a true beauty, in the France of the 1930's.\n\nIt takes a while for the movie to pick up its pace and the movie also tends to drag on a bit in its middle part but in the many parts that the movie finds its right pace, the movie is a great one. It's a real enjoyable comedy, that is not the type of comedy that has some hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud in it but it's more the type of comedy that tries to constantly entertain. It doesn't fail at that, thanks to the movie its very pleasant atmosphere, simplistic story and likable characters. Especially the movie its last halve, in which the villagers start to undertake action, is just great.\n\nA fun and warm little movie.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

In most cases, one would be right. It's thus a pleasant surprise that \"Get Hep to Love\" doesn't fit that mold. The movie actually has a plot, a well-constructed (if a bit far-fetched) story (courtesy of master writer Jay Dratler), and good directing and acting.\n\nThe plot is straightforward: an orphaned 14 year old child prodigy singer is oppressed and driven by her aunt in the name of money. She rebels, runs away from home, and ends up tricking a rural couple into adopting her. The usual complications result from her adventures, but of course everything ends up fine in the end.\n\nThe acting is first-rate, as was usually the case with Universal. Gloria Jean does a fine job of playing the orphan. The supporting cast: stock Universal actors Jane Frazee, Robert Paige, Nana Bryant, Edith Barrett, Irving Bacon, Milliard Mitchell, etc., all perform their roles well and believably.\n\nThe movie does have its 'hep' moments with a lot of dialog and jokes that were popular with the teens of that era. Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan are their usual zany selves, and they perform one of their hectic dance routines. Popular teen soprano Gloria Jean sings a few songs (including the flashy aria \"Siempre Libre\" from the opera \"La Traviata\").\n\nThis musical isn't shown often on TV anymore (very few of the \"B\" musicals are nowadays). However, you can buy a VHS copy of the movie directly from Gloria Jean herself on her website. IMDb rules don't allow the posting of an URL, but you can probably find the website with your favorite search engine, using her full name (\"Gloria Jean Schoonover\") as keywords.\n\nAll in all, this is a movie worth seeing if you get the chance.",

                "text": "Lots of hep cat lingo in parts of this teenage musical comedy drama, starring Gloria Jean(as Doris) and Don O'Connor(as Jimmy). Much of the lingo, no doubt, was improvised, not to be found even in a hipster's dictionary.This includes one of the most used idioms: bundle bunny. My guess is it's derived from the mostly rural pre-central heating American courting tradition of a young woman and her suitor laying fully clothed on her bed under a cover of some sort, while they got better acquainted, and sometimes much farther than that.Anyway, I think it's a cute term for a girlfriend. \n\nDespite the presence of Don O'Connor and several other actors who sometimes were featured singers in films, this is almost exclusively a Gloria Jean singing experience: almost. Her scatter-brained wild-child friend Betty(Peggy Ryan) does get one novelty song as she cavorts around a teen hangout in Betty Hutton-style, leading up to her only wild dancing scene in the film. The 'Jivin' Jacks and Jills' also add to this scene.Unlike some of the other films in the Don + Peggy +Gloria series, Don and Peggy jive dance only a short while, with minimal athletic features, and Don doesn't get to sing at all. Also, Gloria's arch rival for Don's affections: Elaine(Cora Sue Collins), who seems to be the snooty queen bee at this high school, gets one song in the annual school singing contest, to be bested by Gloria's rendition of Semper Libre\". Gloria's prior \"Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes\" is done only half-heartedly, as she is trying to look out the window for Don, where she wants to be. Her only lively song is Ernesto Lecuona's classic \"Siboney\", which she sings for Don while they are parked out in a woods, to show that she can sing at least as well as his current crush: Elaine(Strange that she has an unseen orchestra accompaniment out in this woods!)\n\nAside from these occasional private or stage musical scenes, this is mostly a drama and comedy. Of course, we must have conflict. The 'bad' characters include Gloria's slave-driving wealthy aunt(Gloria is an orphan), who makes her practice her singing to the exclusion of everything else. Then, there is the head of the orphanage where she lands for a while after running away from her aunt, as well as a policeman or two who want to arrest her or send her to an orphanage. I've mentioned Elaine, her rival for Don's attentions. Don also has a wealthy rival for Elaine's attention, thus Elaine goes back and forth between Don and his rival. It's unclear why wild-child Peggy and Gloria, with her reserved academic demeanor, should form an alliance against Elaine. It appears that Peggy and Elaine don't like each other, and Peggy is using Gloria's pursuit of Don to ruffle Elaine. Another 'bad' character is the school principal, who wants to put down Gloria, with her assumed ignorance of academic matters, when she applies to enter the school as a junior. Of course, she astounds him with her detailed knowledge and quick mind. His algebra exam on the blackboard ends in a comical scene. \n\nGloria's temporary adopting parents, Stephen and Anne Winter, are played by handsome personable Robert Paige and beautiful blond Jane Frazee, whom Gloria senses are the perfect parents for the remainder of her teen years. These two played prominent roles in several other of the Don + Peggy + Gloria Jean(sometimes missing one) film series, occasionally being allowed to sing. Problem is Gloria discovered them by stealth, as they were expecting in infant when they applied for adoption, and they don't know that Gloria ran away from the orphanage, as well as her aunt. Conversely, Gloria doesn't know that shortly before her arrival, Anne was about to walk out on her golf-obsessed unambitious husband. After Gloria's arrival, Stephen decides he will look for a better job, to better qualify as Gloria's permanent adopting father. A comical scene follows when Stephen is given the challenge of selling a big life insurance policy to a notoriously wealthy tightwad. Yes, he more than succeeds, using a barrel of comical verbal trickery. Thus, Gloria is functioning as an unintentional 'little miss fix it'.\n\nThe last part of this film gets hectic, as Gloria's aunt traced her to this small town after making the front page with her large reward for Gloria's return. Auntie walks in just as Gloria is finishing her winning recital. She pulls a bewildered Don with her to make a getaway in his car. After a wild chase, they are cornered, and are taken to the police station, with all the other principals arguing about her future disposition. When the judge arrives, it's clear he's all against auntie and for Gloria's choice. Must have been paid off by the Winters.\n\nThis is at least the second film in which Gloria played an orphan. Two years earlier, she costarred with Bing Crosby, who served as her temporary guardian and proxy boyfriend, in the wonderful \"If I Had My Way\". If you want to experience Gloria still with some of her little girl looks and persona, I highly recommend this film. She and Bing made an enchanting and songful team, despite their quite different singing styles. \n\nRobert Paige's birth name was John Page. He eventually had it altered to avoid confusion with another up and coming actor:John Payne, whom he somewhat resembled physically, along with Tyrone Power.\n\nThis film is currently available at You Tube , in 7 segments.",

Andy (Mickey Rooney) is on board a train heading toward Wainwright College, the place where his father (Lewis Stone) made a name for himself years before. Andy has sworn off girls to focus on his studies, that is until he learns that the school has gone co-ed. First he meets Kay (Bonita Granville), a beautiful girl whose maturity causes problems for Andy. Also, he meets a blonde who seems to hate him one moment and love him the next. This girl turns out to be two girls (Lee and Lyn Wilde), twins masquerading as one person. Besides problems with girls, Andy faces issues with an older man (Herbert Marshall) who is not who he seems to be. At home, Judge Hardy battles sickness and a new doctor (Keye Luke) while Mother Hardy (Fay Holden) misses her son.\n\nThis is a truly enjoyable film; nothing special happens, but it retains the upbeat attitude of the other films in the series. The cast is wonderful, though Rooney's personality seems to have waned a bit to show off the talents of the women in the cast, especially the twins. They're beautiful and funny, adding a welcome new dimension to the movie.\n\nOne strange part of the movie are the scenes with the doctor. He is a Chinese man, and everyone in the cast seems to think this is strange and frightening. However, Luke's character takes their stares well and proves himself to be an intelligent and clever member of the cast.",

The last film from director George B. Seitz, who died a couple of months after this was released. Seitz had directed most of the Andy Hardy films up to this point. The Hardy series always had cute girls and this one is no exception. Bonita Granville is pretty and likable. Twins Lee and Lyn Wilde are absolutely adorable and very much steal the movie. Also features a crossover with the Dr. Gillespie series via the appearance of Keye Luke's Dr. Lee Wong Howe. The Hardy series and the Kildare/Gillespie series were MGM's best from the late '30s to the mid '40s so it's a nice bonus for fans of both.\n\nOne of the lesser Andy Hardy movies. It goes on too long and is in desperate need of some trimming. The movie spends about twenty more minutes on the train to the school than it needed to, plus too much time spent on new characters and too little time spent on the Hardy family back home. Anyway, it's still enjoyable, innocent fun. If you're a fan you're likely to be pleased. But this isn't a good jumping-on point for new viewers.",

On his journey he befriends a woman (Bonita Granville) who's more mature than he is, and who's also headed to Wainright as a Freshman. At the same time Andy gets constantly confused by a pair of adorable identical twin sisters (Lee and Lyn Wilde), one of whom likes to flirt with him while the other prefers to smack him across his face (providing some of the few fun moments). This installment seems to drag at 107 minutes, and once Mr. Hardy arrives on campus there seems to be far too much of everything going on at once with nothing really coming together. It's disappointing that Andy's dad (Lewis Stone) is not prominently featured this time; he's mostly stuck home with a bad case of tonsillitis, and is administered to by a Chinese doctor who was born and raised in Brooklyn (Keye Luke). These sequences don't seem to belong in this picture, and overall this is not one of the more consistently entertaining offerings I've seen from this series. ** out of ****",

                "text": "After several movies teasing his admittance, Andy (Mickey Rooney) is finally going to Wainright College. MGM seemed very reluctant to have Andy in the college setting, which was promised several films ago. Here, Andy spends much of his time on the train to college; he had been on the train since December, 1942. All aboard, we meet the Wainright players. The most significant is attractive co-ed Bonita Granville (as Kay Wilson), who will become the girl for Andy. However, she also appears interested in other passenger, much older Wainright dean Herbert Marshall (as Standish). Also on the seemingly endless train ride are beautiful blonde twins Lee and Lyn Wilde (as Lee and Lyn Walker)...\n\nMeanwhile, back in Carvel, Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) develops tonsillitis...\n\nOne of the problems with this movie series was length. These films had little business going over 90 minutes. Many of the weaker entries were over 100 minutes, when MGM should have been aiming for 70 minutes. Not only that, Andy's college life turns out to be a complete bore. \"Blonde Trouble\" is the a most disappointing episode. As seen previously, Mr. Rooney's lip ailment (possibly a \"cold sore\") returns for several scenes. He is able to tighten his lip to hide the blister, at times. Make-up, camera angles and re-takes could have solved the problem; obviously, Rooney's star power had diminished. The minor Carvel story involving Mr. Stone and Chinese doctor Keye Luke (as Lee Wong Howe) is commendable.\n\n*** Andy Hardy's Blonde Trouble (5/4/44) George B Seitz ~ Mickey Rooney, Bonita Granville, Herbert Marshall, Lewis Stone",

That woman was played by Susan Peters but here, it's now Bonita Granville. Also on the way is a blond woman who seems to go hot-and-cold when encountering Andrew but it's actually twins (Lyn and Lee Wilde) passing as one. Meanwhile, at home his father the judge (Lewis Stone) is sick and gets cared for by a new doctor played by Keye Luke who initially gets looks because of his race. Anyway, this was my third viewing of an Andy Hardy picture. Like the other two, I liked Andy Hardy's Blonde Trouble. P.S. Since I always like to cite when a player from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life-is in something else, here it's Frank Faylen-Ernie the taxi driver in that-as Taxi Driver # 2 (Was that typecasting on Frank Capra's part when he did that for him in IAWL?).",

On the train ride there he meets a woman (Bonita Granville) who is more mature than him and feels that Andy needs to grow up. Also on the train are a couple twins (Lee and Lyn Wilde) who Andy ends up helping. Back in Carver, the rest of the Hardy clan must try and come to terms with Andy being gone. At 107-minutes, this entry runs a good thirty-minutes too long but I'm going to guess part of the blame is on the pre-production. Originally this was meant to be a Rooney-less entry as the star was fighting in WWII so the studio did a screenplay without him. I'm going to guess that the stuff here dealing with the Hardy family on their own was from it and the stuff with Andy was added after he returned. The first thirty-minutes here were actually pretty good as Rooney and Granville had some nice chemistry and their relationship was an interesting one. I thought we also got some funny moments with the twins and a running joke of one constantly flirting with Andy while the other slaps him around; poor Andy not realizing they are twins. We even have another interesting subplot involving an older doctor (Herbert Marshall) and his questionable dealings with Granville. What doesn't work is when they finally arrive at college and things just get stretched out. The screenplay goes in so many directions that it's just downright silly, naive and in the end very boring. Things back in Carver aren't any better as the running joke comes from a Chinese doctor (Keye Luke) filling in for a sick doctor and everyone being shocked that he is a doctor due to his race. We see Judge (Lewis Stone) deal with a sore throat as well as a few more stories involving the broken down car that Andy started selling in the previous film, ANDY HARDY'S DOUBLE LIFE. It goes without saying that the entire cast is good and once again it was a real pleasure seeing Granville, best remembered for her Nancy Drew roles at Warner. The cast is certainly up to a high level but it's a shame the screenplay didn't try to do more.",

HOWEVER, this particular piece hits home to my personal life's experience.\n\nFirst, I'd like to edify the previous comment;about the Chinese Doctor. You haveta remember that this was made in 1944, and the Japanese in the USA on the West Coast were INTERRED at camps around the US---EVEN the Japanese that were born in America had to give up EVERYTHING, and leave.\n\nRemember, The doctor was born in \"That bastion of culture, and learning\"....to which, the Judge replies, 'Peking?'.... The Doctor says, \"No, .... \"Brooklyn\"!!!! This upheaval the Japanese-Americans/ Naturalized-Americans/ETC. was HIGHLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL!... BUT, in 1944, there was still a high number of 'flag waving patriots' that still thought this was right...ie:to 'STEM the flow of the 'Japs'! These SAME Americans, today are uttering this kind of comment;sorry for my editorial comment!\n\nThere is much sage advice given by the Judge in this flic!!!;even though he is stricken with tonsillitis-and can't talk;there is an hilarious scene where his wife is GLAD he can't speak. I'd especially want to draw you to the later scenes with Ms. Granville, and Mr. Marshall that are DEFINITELY NOT comedic! In fact, some of the teachers down here in Florida need to heed the advice of the learned Judge!\n\nIn fact, the scene where he pontificates...hey, pretty big word for moi!... about Student/Teacher 'relations' is a GREAT scene... It takes place at the bus stop when Andy is quitting school, and taking the easy way out of his troubles... He, unwittingly, had come up with a HUGE 'TALL-Tale' to the father of the Walker Twins---who are GORGEOUS!!knock-outs!.\n\nPlease watch this movie, and the sequel,\"Love Laughs at Andy Hardy\" ...again with Ms. Granville-even though made 2 years later, it takes place in the same 'Frosh' year of Andy Hardy. Finaaly, i'd suggest you check out the bio of Ms. Granville she IS the gal in this movie... I believe she is still alive.",

McCabe never really got a chance to develop a theme or style in his cartoons - the famous Looney Tunes directors all developed their own styles - but the few of his that I've seen certainly have made me laugh. This one did. Worth seeing, although it probably did function more as a place-holder when it came out; 1943 saw the release of such greats as \"A Corny Concerto\", \"Super-Rabbit\", \"Pigs in a Polka\" and \"Porky Pig's Feat\".",

While it may not be the most serious of the \"Inner Sanctum\" series of low-low-budget thrillers made by Unversal between 1943 and 1945, it is likely the most entertaining. Part murder mystery, part wax museum horror film, part romance, \"The Frozen Ghost\" gallops along at a nonsensical pace and features a rich group of actors, all of whom are peculiarly cast. Leading the pack is Lon Chaney, who tried to escape the heavy Wolf Man and Mummy makeup with this series, and who does a pretty good job as a stage hypnotist tormented by the thought that he might have killed someone during his act. This might be Chaney's best stab at a leading man role, though it is undermined by the fact that every single female character in the film, from age 16 to 40, falls madly in love with him at sight, much in the way Roger Moore's version of James Bond was a walking aphrodisiac. While Chaney was a passable leading man, ascribing this rampant sex appeal to him is as fantastical as brain transplants. Douglas Dumbrille, a smooth British actor given to silky villains, plays the tough American detective, and Martin Kosleck, usually cast as a cold as ice Nazi, here appears as a road-company Peter Lorre lunatic. And Milburn Stone -- \"Doc\" on \"Gunsmoke\" -- shows up as Chaney's harried agent. But don't even worry about the caprices of the casting or plotting. Just sit back, try to keep up with it, and enjoy the kind of anything-goes film-making that doesn't exist anymore.",

This feature's got a competent cast and a few scattered good ideas, but they're only half-baked and just don't rise in the oven.\n\nLon Chaney plays Alex Gregor, a stage hypnotist who reads people's minds along with the aid of his female assistant and romantic interest, Maura (Evelyn Ankers again). During one of their live clairvoyant acts, \"Gregor the Great\" (ha!) tries to hypnotize a man from the audience and the subject collapses, stone cold dead. Now Alex thinks he killed the man with his mind and the inner turmoil he feels makes him ripe for a breakdown. There's no better way to relax from your troubles than a nice stay at a friend's wax museum, so Gregor takes up an offer to do just that for awhile. Once he arrives amongst the mannequins, he finds he still retains the power to kill with his eyes, as strange goings-on ensue.\n\nThat brief description sounds more interesting than it turns out, because this is a wasted opportunity to utilize a wax museum backdrop for the one and only time in a Universal horror film. Nothing really happens for the hour's running length of this thoroughly average snoozer. Chaney goes through his basic motions once again, and with Harold Young now directing there isn't as much suspense or intrigue as the previous installments managed to cook up under LeBorg. Milburn Stone is pretty good as Gregor's business manager, and pretty Elena Verdugo (the gypsy girl from HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN) is on hand as the darling niece of the museum owner. But once again, it's Martin Kosleck who gets a raw deal as an effectively menacing, knife-wielding stalker. It's just another case where poor Kosleck, perhaps the best thing in the whole picture, gets buried inside yet another of Universal's more mediocre movies. ** out of ****",

Besides, it's aided immensely by the presence of Martin Kosleck as the unhinged museum 'curator' (with a secret medical past) and Douglass Dumbrille as the wily investigating detective with a fondness for quoting Shakespeare (there's a section of wax figures devoted to characters from the Bard's work).

                "text": "1944's \"The Frozen Ghost\" was fourth of the six 'Inner Sanctum' mysteries (released only an entire year after completion), later included in Universal's popular SHOCK! package of classic horror films issued to television in the late 50s, its intriguing title and stronger than usual cast perhaps explaining its more frequent showings than the four other SHOCK! titles. As a vehicle for Lon Chaney however, it's probably the weakest, repeating his pity party from the previous entry, \"Dead Man's Eyes,\" this time as Alex Gregor, successful stage hypnotist, whose latest subject, an alcoholic skeptic (Arthur Hohl), succumbs while going into a trance. The amazingly cloddish and unsympathetic Gregor has no one but himself to blame for all his subsequent troubles, blaming his mesmeric powers for the man's fatal heart attack, and ending his engagement to his lovely partner, Maura Daniel (Evelyn Ankers). Gregor's business manager, George Keene (Milburn Stone), hits upon the brilliant idea of having his downtrodden client begin working at the wax museum of Valerie Monet (Tala Birell), whose teenage niece, Nina Cordreau (Elena Verdugo), quickly develops a crush on the older man. Unhappily, this conflicts with Valerie's own designs on Gregor, who continues to behave in such a crestfallen manner that one would think that any self respecting female would preferably flee from him with great haste. Once the action shifts to the waxworks, Chaney's hapless histrionics fade into the background, actually not a bad thing, as Universal's latest discovery, Martin Kosleck, was making his feature debut for the studio (following a 13 chapter serial, \"The Great Alaskan Mystery\"), as Rudi Poldan, curator and former plastic surgeon of dubious accomplishment, who hasn't entirely given up his experiments. With so many broads hot for the disturbed yet dull-as-dishwater Gregor, Rudi has his sights set on young Nina, displaying his knife throwing abilities when rebuffed (as they were in \"The Mad Doctor,\" \"The Mummy's Curse,\" and \"Pursuit to Algiers\"). This entry's police detective is played by Douglass Dumbrille, usually cast as surprise killers, rather more amiable than his predecessors, but also more bland. Exotic beauty Tala Birell, an enticing 36 at the time, was mainly reduced to Poverty Row titles at this juncture, others of interest including \"The Lone Wolf Returns,\" \"One Dangerous Night,\" \"Isle of Forgotten Sins,\" \"The Monster Maker,\" \"The Power of the Whistler,\" \"Philo Vance's Secret Mission,\" and \"Philo Vance's Gamble.\" Dimpled darling Elena Verdugo was no stranger to Lon Chaney, previously providing his love interest in \"House of Frankenstein,\" and still proving an eyeful opposite Lon in 1952's \"Thief of Damascus.\" She also did \"Little Giant\" (Abbott and Costello), \"The Sky Dragon\" (Charlie Chan), \"The Lost Tribe\" (Jungle Jim), and \"The Lost Volcano\" (Bomba the Jungle Boy), before switching to television, where she endured as Robert Young's devoted nurse on MARCUS WELBY. It was a bittersweet swansong for the departing Evelyn Ankers (after 29 Universal features in four years), clearly pregnant with her only child, whose movie career covered only 11 more films. As for Chaney, this lukewarm repeat role clearly did him no favors, somewhat reviving himself for the climax, which also allowed Evelyn Ankers a chance for redemption. As one might expect, \"The Frozen Ghost\" made an astounding eight appearances on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater- Apr 16 1966 (following 1958's \"Night of the Blood Beast\"), June 21 1969 (following 1940's \"The Man with Nine Lives\"), May 12 1973 (preceding 1969's \"It's Alive!\"), July 20 1974 (following 1950's \"Missile Monsters\"), Mar 15 1975 (following first feature \"House of Horrors,\" from 1946, and second feature \"The Invisible Woman,\" from 1940), Dec 4 1976 (preceding 1966's \"The War of the Gargantuas\"), June 17 1978 (preceding 1955's \"Revenge of the Creature\"), and Apr 23 1983 (solo).",

Alex Gregor felt hate for the volunteer due to the idiot's bad behavior, even mentioning that he could kill him, and this is what torments the hypnotist. He is so tormented, Alex quits his gig and decides to help Valerie Monet (Tala Birell) with her wax museum business, using the former celebrity to help bring in customers. Maura Daniel (Evelyn Ankers) was to marry Gregor (she is his assistant, often put under hypnosis and foretells what certain people in the audience are thinking) before the embarrassing death, which led Alex to call of their engagement and leave the profession. Of course, she still loves Gregor and wants to rekindle their broken relationship. Valerie Monet and her niece, Nina (Elena Verdugo; the gypsy in \"House of Frankenstein\"), both fall for Gregor (haha, these Inner Sanctum mysteries always have all the ladies completely enamored with Chaney's characters) leading to multiple complications. Martin Kosleck (the mad sculptor in \"House of Horrors\" co-starring Rando Hatton) is a former plastic surgeon, driven from the practice due to a patient's \"miscalculation\", now Madame Monet's wax sculpture artist, Dr. Rudi Polden, one of those creepy, *eccentric* weirdos who talks to his figures as if they were alive. Rudi is infatuated with Nina and has a severe dislike for Gregor because he \"bosses him around\". In actuality, Rudi is jealous because Nina carries a torch for Gregor (who considers her a child). There's plenty of jealousy to go around, though, as Valerie competes for Gregor even if he doesn't have the same feelings for her as he does for Maura. Milburn Stone is Gregor's business agent, George Keene, who seems interested in helping his client get over this obsession with causing death through hypnotic suggestion. When Valerie disappears after an argument with Gregor results in him using his hypnotism, out of anger, to \"predispose\" her, Alex is worried that he has killed again, blacking out for a period before finding himself near a pier. Douglass Dumbrille rounds out the cast as a pesky inspector who considers everyone a suspect in Val's disappearance, soon eyeing Gregor when Nina also vanishes (after making a startling discovery when one of Rudi's wax sculptures is a bit *too* lifelike.).\n\nA wax museum, a diabolical sculptor, a double-cross in the works for poor Gregor, hypnotism, disappearances, suspended animation, and a hero's tormented psyche questioning his unique ability as if it were a dangerous weapon he cannot control, \"The Frozen Ghost\" has a lot going on. I think by this point, the \"Inner Sanctum Mysteries\" series was starting to show its age, the fourth film has some pretty bland writing and practically little imagination, not to mention, Chaney's role isn't as interesting as, say, Kosleck's. Chaney is a weary, tortured soul\u0097sound familiar? That's all it is, honestly, I wish the series had mixed things up (like they did in \"Weird Woman\" when Evelyn Ankers was given a juicy villainous part), and given Chaney a chance to play the corrupt character instead of always being saddled with the Lawrence Talbot victim. It isn't that Chaney cannot portray a heel, just watch \"The Alligator People\".\n\nAnyway, there's one surprising moment out of left field, when the story reveals a plot to have Gregor committed, the mastermind perhaps not who you would expect. Evelyn Ankers, after probably her best part at Universal Studios with \"Weird Woman\", resorts back to beautiful love interest to Chaney, a supporting part that doesn't require much from her other than the \"stand by your man\" aspect her characters are often provided. Kosleck has a keen ability at portraying the kinds of characters who can make your skin crawl; his love for Nina unrequited, only fueling his psychopathic behavior. The screenplay certainly throws in everything but the kitchen sink so there might be something for fans of Universal horror to enjoy.",

Following his pattern of movie titles of \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942) and \"The Mummy's Ghost\" (1944), this latest installment of misleading \"Ghost\" titles doesn't deal with a scientific expedition in the Arctic Circle discovering a dead man inside a block of ice whose ghost haunts them by night. Instead, it's another tale of mystery and supernatural. In the tradition of its previous three \"Inner Sanctum\" mysteries (\"Calling Doctor Death,\" \"Weird Woman\" and \"Dead Man's Eyes\"), there's that opening of a disembodied head of the Inner Sanctum (David Hoffman) seemingly floating back and forth inside a crystal ball addressing the movie audience once more with this statement: \"This is the Inner Sanctum, the strange fantastic world controlled by mass of living, cult seeking flesh. The mind, it destroys, distorts, creates monsters. Yes, even YOU without knowing can commit murder.\" As the opening credits roll, the story scripted by Luci Ward and Bernard Shubert comes to life, sans any frozen ghost seeking seclusion in a warm haunted house.\n\nThe prologue starts off on a radio show (with good use of slanted camera angles) introducing a mentalist named Alex Gregor (Lon Chaney), professionally known as Gregor the Great, along with his assistant and fianc\u00e9e, Maura Daniel (Evelyn Ankers), as his hypnotic subject reading inner thoughts from those selected from the studio audience. The show goes well until a drunken skeptic (Arthur Hohl) calls Gregor a fake, claiming his act is done with mirrors. Upset of being ridiculed and saying in an angry state of mind, \"I could kill him,\" Gregor invites the drunk on the platform to prove him wrong. As Gregor puts the him under his hypnotic spell, the skeptic immediately dies. Although the coroner rules death from a heart attack, which prevents him from being arrested by Inspector Brandt (Douglass Dumbrille) from the Homicide Bureau, Gregor still insists that he's a murderer. Breaking off his engagement with Maura and canceling all future engagements, it's George Keene (Milburn Stone), Gregor's business manager and closest friend, who suggests Gregor go away for a mental relaxation, arranging a stay with Valerie Monet (Tala Birell) at her owned establishment of Madame Monet's Wax Museum who designs the costumes, accompanied by her young niece Nina Goldreau (Elena Verdugo), and Rudi Poldar (Martin Kosleck), who resents Gregor's presence at the museum. Gregor's stay is anything but restful when coping with expert dagger thrower Rudi and his jealous tendencies towards him and Nina; Nina finding her life in danger after discovering interesting facts about the wax figures; Gregor's argument with Valerie that causes to her mysterious disappearance; and the arrival of Inspector Brandt placing all suspicions on Gregor, who, by this time, is slowly going insane.\n\nFor the seventh and final of the Chaney and Ankers teaming, THE FROZEN GHOST belongs mostly to Chaney. What's interesting other than the use of hypnosis as the answer to the mystery and occasional use of voice over train of thought from Chaney's point of view, is how moments of the Wax Museum portions comes as a reminder to Lionel Atwill's MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Brothers, 1933), when watching Rudi Poldar, formerly Doctor Feldon, a plastic surgeon whose career was professionally ruined, conversing with his created wax figures of Napoleon, Cleopatra or Marie Antoinette as though they were living beings. The final moments involving the fire burning furnace looks as if this idea for a climax were lifted from the little known poverty row movie mystery, A SHREIK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) starring Ginger Rogers. Other than that, THE FROZEN GHOST, once shown frequently on commercial television before being phased out of circulation by the late 1970s, is a not-bad one hour quickie made agreeable for fans of this type of entertainment.\n\nFormerly presented on home video in the 1997 as a companion piece with WEIRD WOMAN (1944), THE FROZEN GHOST can be found on DVD on a triple bill with its fellow Inner Sanctum mysteries of \"Strange Confession\" and \"Pillow of Death\" all featuring the mustached/guilt-ridden Lon Chaney.

The doctor says the man died of natural causes but Alex becomes obsessed with the notion that he possesses the literal power of \"looks that kill\".

Many of the actors were seen in several of the films, though Chaney managed to play the lead in all of them. The stories were B-films--with small budgets and running at just over 60 minutes each. In many ways, they were similar to the later \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" TV series. In addition, Columbia Pictures apparently thought there was money in the concept and brought out The Whistler series just a year after the first Inner Sanctum film. Like the other series, the same actor was supposed to star in the films and they all had different stories about murder and mayhem. Of the two series, I think the Inner Sanctum ones were just a bit better and part of this was because Chaney was excellent in the films.\n\nChaney plays a stage mentalist who apparently accidentally killed an audience member using his psychic powers. Since Chaney is such a nice guy, he can't live with himself and gives up the stage. Oddly, he is offered a job working in a wax museum and things seem okay, until yet another person dies--seemingly from Chaney's power.\n\nTHE FROZEN GHOST is a fun movie to watch, though I'll also admit that the plot was a bit silly and there were a lot of plot holes. At times, characters behave irrationally due to poor writing and plot is incredibly convoluted and tough to believe. However, for lovers of the genre, it's still well worth a look.",

Mentalist Gregor (Chaney) uses his hypnotic powers to read minds, which makes for a good stage act until he goes bonkers over a subject's accidental death. From then on events pile up in no particular order or reason. The only requirement appears that whatever the four writers come up with, it has to happen inside the cheesy wax museum where notorious villains of the past slouch around like department store manikins. I guess they're supposed to be scary. But that's hard to tell since director Young appears to have no discernible purpose in what he puts on-screen. The final product plays like it's assembled from 5-dollar odds and ends inside a single tacky set.\n\nAnd that's too bad, because it's a waste of an outstanding supporting cast-- Dumbrille and Kosleck, Ankers and Birell. One thing about this series\u0097it sure has its share of classy dames. However, part of the series' problem is a miscast Chaney. His hulking frame is not exactly the dress-up, lover-boy type. Yet his role in the series has him playing intellectual, irresistible types from one entry to the next. No doubt the studio was hoping to promote the films with his Wolf Man reputation. Also, note that he's not appearing with any body make-up as he does in so many of his other horror features. I wouldn't be surprised he had that written into his contract, maybe in hopes of elevating his career out of the horror genre. As a result, the scariest thing he does here is stare into the camera for bleary-eyed close-ups. Thus, about the only reason to scope out this disappointing 60-minutes is to catch Chaney in a Clark Gable moustache.",

Stanford Jolley as Hatch Bolton. His henchmen include Charles King as Al Craig, and John Cason as Ed Blaine. It's a common scenario, Bolton's scheme to force the local ranchers into selling out to him is carried out by controlling the supplies and livestock feed heading into town, and if the ranchers can't buy it, they have to pack it in.\n\nWith a clue provided by a rancher shot through the window of his cabin, Curley deciphers a drawing that resembles a pair of steer horns over a bar. Well what could that be other than a pair of steer horns hanging over the bar of a local saloon? It's where the former sheriff hid the ranchers' money to buy needed supplies in a kind of hide in plain sight scenario. With Curley driving a decoy rig to draw out the bad guys, his partner Sam Hawkins (Saylor) takes a wagon loaded with supplies into town to save the day for the ranchers.\n\nBob Steele fans ought to be pleased with this entry as he mixes it up with the bad guys a few times in the fisticuffs department, and Syd Saylor is entertaining as mentioned earlier.

Bugs, Daffy) but Porky is still a likable and quite endearing character all the same. Porky's Party is one of the best of his early cartoons, not only is it hilarious but it allows Porky to be part of the action rather than just be a bystander who appears every now and then. The dog and the penguin are great supporting characters, both of them have some really great gags, the dog with the alcohol/hare tonic and the razor and the penguin with the wild but very funny gag of the top hat propping up inside him and when he disguises himself as a hat-stand. The last minute or so is wild chaos and in that unmistakable Bob Clampett style, which I loved. There is even a bird/ostrich character who turns up briefly, but with a visual gag involving a sign that still makes its mark. The animation is crisp and colourful, and the music is full of that vibrant energy you'd expect from Looney Tunes. Mel Blanc's voice work is spot-on as well. It is true that there is not much of a plot but the humour, animation and interplay between the characters makes that not matter at all. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

                "text": "\"Porky's Party\" is an excellent Porky Pig cartoon directed by the wackiest of all animation directors: Bob Clampett. Clampett gave his cartoons at Warner Bros. a great amount of youthful energy and a kind of craziness that is UNMATCHED, with \"Porky's Party\" certainly being no exception to the rule. The plot of this film can be summarized quite easily: Porky invites two of his friends over to his house for his birthday party, where they all undergo some hilarious misadventures. One of the causes of all the trouble is a mischievous silkworm that Porky receives as a birthday gift from his uncle. Accompanying all these wacky adventures is the wonderfully swinging music score by Carl Stalling.\n\nMy favorite scenes from \"Porky's Party\" include the following (but DON'T read any further until after you have seen this cartoon). Porky is absolutely hilarious at becoming embarrassed by all the feminine undergarments that the silkworm sews from underneath Porky's coat. Porky becomes no less hilarious upon spotting his dog Black Fury with exceptionally long hair and a mouth covered with shaving cream, after which Porky gyrates wildly in all directions while shouting, \"Mad dog!\" And the penguin, after having accidentally eaten the silkworm, just cannot prevent his own head from popping into a top hat; the ending of this cartoon features the wildest sight gag of all, in which the exasperated penguin becomes an unbelievable conglomeration of garments sewn by the silkworm!\n\n\"Porky's Party\" can be found on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3 Disc 3, with an additional audio commentary by contemporary animators John Kricfalusi and Eddie Fitzgerald, who are both huge fans of Bob Clampett. During the aforementioned scene of Porky with the undergarments, Fitzgerald simply cannot control his rather contagious laughter!",

As far as I can tell, his only three cartoons during this era that had truly lasting significance were 1935's \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" (his debut), 1937's \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" (Daffy Duck's debut) and 1938's \"Porky in Wackyland\" (the ultimate exercise in zany surrealism). \"Porky's Party\" was one of the shorts where the Termite Terrace crowd came up with a routine situation and milked it, with rather childish results.\n\nThere certainly are some funny scenes. I couldn't have predicted the stuff with the hat in the guy's body. But seriously, the whole thing looks better on the storyboard (the DVD includes the original designs as an special feature). If they'd continued casting Porky in these kinds of roles, that would have quickly been all for him, folks. Fortunately, when we entered WWII, his really clever roles took off. During and immediately after the war, there were \"My Favorite Duck\", \"Porky Pig's Feat\", \"Brother Brat\", \"Baby Bottleneck\", \"Kitty Kornered\" and \"Little Orphan Airedale\". In the post-war years, he often was the foil to Daffy Duck's craziness.",

The couple had been married from the early 1890s, and moved from the United States to England, settling in London. Crippen was the possessor of a degree from a small medical college in the midwest, but he really was on shaky ground as a physician under British standards (or the standards of a major American city for that matter). In fact, he was a seller of patent medicines, and practiced some opthalmology and dentistry under questionable auspices. But he was a good businessman, and made a comfortable living. Cora had pretensions of being an opera singer, and trained her voice. She did have some performances at various music halls, but her career was mediocre at best. She also treated the long suffering, mild Crippen as dirt, making him clean up her lover's shoes when they slept over at their home. Crippen hired a secretary, Ethel Le Neve, and they fell in love. In January 1910 Belle disappeared. Her friends became concerned, and Crippen told them she had left him. Later he told them that she died in Los Angelas. But when Le Neve was seen wearing her jewelry they became suspicious. Contacting Scotland Yard about their suspicions, the Yard sent Inspector Walter Dew to see what was going on. At first Crippen seemed plausible, but then he and Le Neve fled. The remains of Belle were found in the basement. She had been poisoned. Crippen and Le Neve (disguised as his son) fled by ocean liner to Canada, followed by Dew, who arrested them off Quebec. They were taken back to England, where both were tried. The Doctor partly tied up his defense by insisting on protecting Le Neve. As a result he was found guilty and she was acquitted. The Doctor was hanged in November 1910.\n\nA movie was made, with Donald Pleasance as Crippen, and there have been films based on the story such as WE ARE NOT ALONE with Paul Muni. But this film with Charles Laughton is considered the best. Laughton captures the basic decency of the central figure, who made a bad marriage to a shrew, and fell for a decent woman too late. There are differences in the story. Rosalind Ivan (playing the \"Belle\" character) is not poisoned (like Flora Robson in the Muni film) but dies in an apparent accident falling downstairs. Laughton has a son who one suspects will marry the Le Neve figure after the film ends. And Laughton never even gets to see Canada, but gives himself up in England to save a neighbor suspected of killing her husband (a blackmailer Laughton has killed - another plot innovation not involved in the actual crime). But the film moves well, and one constantly feels for Laughton's character. Finally the fine Stanley Ridges gives a typically good performance as the counterpart of Inspector Walter Dew, who ended up sympathizing with the man whom he captured.",

Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Paul Ivano. \n\nIn 1902 Edwardian London, unhappily married shopkeeper Philip Marshall (Laughton) meets beautiful Mary Gray (Raines) and a tender friendship begins to form. But once Philip's wife discovers what is going on she threatens him with exposure and scandal, forcing Philip to take drastic action... \n\nHow delightfully off, that a film that features a wife murderer, an alcoholic wife beater and blackmail, should be so restrained and actually beautiful. The Suspect in principal is about a decent man pushed to do bad things by his awful life when hope then springs from an unlikely source. The moral shadings here are most intricate, Laughton's Philip Marshal is a completely sympathetic and fascinating character, the makers deftly toying with our perceptions in the process. \n\nThere's no mystery element to drive the story forward, we are only really left wondering how the finale will play out. However, the lack of mystery is not a problem because Siodmak has a keen eye for suspense and knows how to use gaslight interiors and foggy streets to represent the psychological turmoil of Philip and his life that's now drastically changing. Murder as justifiable homicide? Ridding the world of bad people is OK? Rest assured that it is far darker than it appears on the surface. \n\nBrilliantly performed by Laughton and Raines, and mounted with great atmospheric skill by Siodmak, The Suspect is a little seen gem waiting to be found by a wider audience. 8/10",

It's really what film acting is all about, every breath, every nuance, every gesture is carefully delineated and brought to the screen. Laughton had a reputation for driving some of his directors a little nuts with his perfectionism and maybe he did to Robert Siodmark here. I prefer to think the two of them collaborated on a masterpiece.\n\nThe setting is Edwardian London in 1902. From outward appearances Laughton is a happy man, making a good living with a wife and a grown son. But he is married to one shrew of a woman he's put up with for over 20 years. He's ripe for a midlife crisis and ripe to stray. But a friendship he develops with pretty young Ella Raines recently hired at Laughton's office drives wife Rosalind Ivan up a wall. Later on Ivan dies as a result of a fall down the house stairs. Nobody can prove one way or the other whether it was murder. Scotland Yard's Stanley Ridges is up a wall with it.\n\nLaughton and Ivan have a couple of neighbors, married couple Henry Daniell and Molly Lamont. When Ridges confides in Daniell during the course of the investigation, he inadvertently sets the stage for tragedy. Daniell himself says he's a 'total rotter' and proves it the audience's satisfaction. \n\nThe Suspect is one of many films based on the famous Dr. Crippen murder which was also in the same period. The only fault with the film is that the rest of the cast is fairly one dimensional in their characters next to Charles Laughton. But if you are a Laughton fan, this film is an absolute must.",

The suspected wife killer had booked a passage to Canada along with his pretty secretary and mistress (who was disguised as a young man). Through means of the Marconi wireless and morse code the police were able to apprehend them while at sea. According to a documentary that I saw, witnesses at the time said that while Dr. Crippen was a nice quiet man, his wife was an overbearing harpie. \"The Suspect\" is a retelling of the Dr. Crippen case with Charles Laughton playing to perfection the meek and kindly shop manager married to a complete harridan (Rosalind Ivan was excellent and very scary in the part).\n\nThe movie created great suspense by the questions that were not answered - did Phillip Marshall kill his wife?? - the act wasn't shown and the murder that Phillip actually committed posed the question, will he get away with it and find true happiness?? Whatever happened the audience is on Phillip's side all the way!!\n\nPhillip Marshall is married to a nagging shrew and when his son leaves because his mother has deliberately burned some documents, for him it is the last straw and he moves to a different bedroom. The same day he meets Mary Gray (beautiful Ella Raines) when she comes seeking work, she is taken by his kindness to one of the junior clerks but, unfortunately, there is no work for her. On his way home Phillip finds Mary crying in the park, she is destitute and needs a job. After taking her to a cafe he finds her a job and so begins the start of a beautiful friendship which blossoms into love - they go to the music hall, ballet etc and Phillip suddenly finds life worth living again. Of course his wife refuses to divorce him and after a particularly vicious quarrel where she threatens to drag Mary's name through the mud, the next morning she is found dead. It seems to be a case of accidental death but suddenly Scotland Yard Detective Huxley (Stanley Ridges, who was excellent in \"Black Friday\") is snooping around.\n\nPhillip has always tried to be a friend to his long suffering neighbour Edith Simmons (Molly Lamont is just marvellous) who is married to the despicable Gilbert (Henry Daniell) who is not above knocking her around. When vile Gilbert tries his hand at a little blackmail, he has no proof that Phillip did kill his wife but he says he will lie to the police unless Phillip starts giving him money whenever he requests it. When Phillip goes into the kitchen and spies the sleeping medicine Gilbert is history but......\n\nThere are some parts that are hard to believe. Phillip hides the body behind the sofa and convinces his now wife Mary that Canada is the place to start a new life but before they can sail is persuaded to give himself up as Edith has been arrested for her husband's murder. As Huxley says \"he is too much of a gentleman and fine person to allow her to take the blame\"!! Why was Huxley hounding him then and how come the body was found in the river??? How would a very out of condition Phillip be able to get the body down there??? Another jarring moment to me was that I thought Ella Raines was just too young and beautiful to be attracted to Charles Laughton's character in any but a friendly, fatherly way. The fact that Ella Raines makes her character's feelings completely believable is a real tribute to this very under rated actress. Those were just a few, slight quibbles with what was an overall superlative film.\n\nThe big news of the moment is that new DNA evidence has come to light to suggest Dr. Crippen is really innocent of killing his wife.",

The milquetoast is played to perfection by Laughton, and his wife is played in the same manner by Rosalind Ivan.\n\nNow comes an UnHitchcock-like development in the person of the Scotland Yard detective, played with an extremely heavy hand by Stanley Ridges. After introducing himself to Laughton, he immediately reenacts a supposed murder scene without even taking off his coat. He continues his seemingly unmotivated investigation for the rest of the picture, culminating in a completely far-fetched and disappointing ending. \n\nThat said, the picture is completely absorbing, made even more so by Laughton and by a terrific job in support by Henry Daniell, Laughton's alcoholic neighbor.

Laughton is the same film. The movie is good, the plot is interesting, the scenes are very well managed, the work of the actors is excellent and very well run. But the difference between a good film and an excellent film is Charles Laughton, who achieved perfection in the character of mature businessman whose personal life is bound to the matrimonial boredom and monotony to the random, capricious, put in your way Her Reines a good actress who can love the most phlegmatic of Englishmen,\n\nIn short, a film property, Siodmak, Raines and especially Laughton to become excellent film with some of the topics that are abound in this film, as the police seem clueless, but ultimately well-known lay a trap.

Ella Raines is delightfully lovely as the decent girl Laughton falls in love with. Henry Daniels is perfectly cast as the blackmailing neighbour, who ultimately seals Laughton's fate. The ending of this story is both very compelling and touching for the moral character Laughton plays.

Tex Fletcher is pretty good here. I've never seen his work before. He's a sleepy eyed, marginally attractive cowboy, and he can sing pretty good, singing songs such as \"When I Get Back in The Range\" and that all time classic \"They Won't Stretch My Neck If I Know It\". The supporting cast is very good as well, with bonus points going to Jack Mchugh as Fletcher's goofy sidekick Butch. A surprisingly entertaining movie!",

Grand National Pictures were going bankrupt as the movie was made so Fletcher got the rights and made personal appearances at theatres in the north eastern United States where he was most popular. He went back to New York where he could make more money on Mutual Network radio and television shows produced at WOR New York. He was also the star at The Village Barn in New York. In the late 1970's Mike Longworth of the Martin Guitar Company was trying to find their only D-42. He was surprised to find Tex Fletcher alive and well in New York and he still had the guitar. Fletcher donated it to the Martin museum. He passed away in New York on March 14, 1987.",

While other films were planned, only this one feature was made since Grand National went bankrupt--and Fletcher took it upon himself to cross the nation promoting this film. It was to no avail, as no other film offers resulted and the singer ended up fading into oblivion. However, after seeing the film, I wonder if the bankruptcy really had that much effect on Fletcher, as the film wasn't very good nor was Fletcher. The bottom line is that the film had all the usual B-western clich\u00e9s, very pedestrian writing at best, little in the way of action and a relatively dull leading man. So, it really had nothing to distinguish it from the vast hoard of other sub- par films in the genre from that time. Worth seeing if you insist on seeing every cowboy film ever made, otherwise easy to skip.",

                "text": "This B-western starts off with two big strikes against it. First, it features Max Terhune and his 'friend', Elmer. Elmer, it turns out, is a ventriloquist's dummy and the idea of this in an old-time western is just plain stupid. It's also one of the most inexplicable things I've ever seen in a movie and it's hard to believe 56 films were made with this wooden dummy (a literal wooden dummy--I am not making some sort of pejorative comment about Elmer's acting talents)! Elmer appeared in mostly westerns with the likes of Gene Autry, Robert Livingston and Johnny Mack Brown and even appeared in a Dick Tracy film!!! Second, the film begins with standard plot #6--the fake prison escape in order to find out where the bandit hideout is--something that was done dozens and dozens of times before and after--making the film very predictable. Because of these problems, Ray Corrigan starts off the film was some major handicaps. At least Dusty King's singing is a pleasant addition.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the film begins with Corrigan being locked up and then 'rescued' by one friend--and soon meeting 'by accident' with another. In the process, another prisoner (a real prisoner) shows them where his hideout is at Fugitive Valley. Now you'd THINK with a name like this that the authorities would have already suspected Fugitive Valley was a hideout! The three Range Busters (the name given to this trio of good guys in a string of B-westerns) must find out who the leader is--the Whip! The gang keep insisting that there is no real Whip--it's just an alias they all use. But Corrigan's razor-sharp instincts tell him that there is a Mr. Big behind all this and he's determined to find him or her. Overall, despite the plot and Elmer, the acting and singing are fine--even if it's all very predictable if you've seen more than a few westerns. Not bad...but not particularly inspired either.\n\nBy the way, if you like trivia, note Gray in this film. He's Glenn Strange and played in a ton of westerns...as well as played Frankenstein's monster in several of Universal's horror films {such as \"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\").",

                "text": "For anyone keeping score, this was the eighth Range Busters film from Monogram Studios, who churned them out at a gallop beginning with the first in the series simply titled \"The Range Busters\". To give you an idea how prolific they were, eight pictures were made in 1941 alone, with a total of twenty four appearing between 1940 and 1943. The original trio of Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, John 'Dusty' King and Max 'Alibi' Terhune appeared in the first sixteen pictures, and an educated guess tells me that Alibi's wooden dummy Elmer did too.\n\nMost of these pictures offered pleasurable matin\u00e9e entertainment for young fans of the day, though some might find they take a little getting used to today. As a fan of this stuff, I can watch them all, but even so some are better than others. This one's OK, but it's got some clumsy elements that are downright hokey, like the lame gimmick the doc called 'actiminikosis' when treating Crash and Dusty for their discolored blue tongues. Seems I developed the same symptoms once when I had some blueberry pie.\n\nThe story opens with Crash getting arrested and then breaking out of jail with Dusty's help, along with outlaw Red Langdon (Bob Kortman), who shows his appreciation by introducing the boys to his outlaw bunch holed up in Fugitive Valley. It's a standard plot device used in dozens of B Westerns, here used with a slight twist as Alibi comes on the scene pretending not to know his partners, and using the stage name of Professor Hammo the Great, renowned magician and ventriloquist. That's where Elmer comes in, though he didn't really have much of a part to play in this one.\n\nA cool element in the story has to do with the character of Ann Savage (Julie Duncan), who's role is left rather ambiguous as she assumes the identity of a mysterious outlaw known as 'The Whip'. Meeting up with her 'gang' at a secret hideout, she takes part in a robbery, and it's not until the finale that we learn she's actually working as an undercover Pinkerton Agent to take down the baddies led by Glenn Strange. The final showdown is a rather awkward affair, as some of the bad guys get shot down returning fire with no cover, not really a smart move if you ask me.\n\nIf the idea of a a woman heading up an outlaw gang is one that you find intriguing, a picture I can recommend has Jennifer Holt in the title role of \"The Hawk of Powder River\", an Eddie Dean flick from 1948. It's not often you'll see a female gunned down in a Western, but it happens in that one. Meanwhile, back in Fugitive Valley, the boys in conversation with Miss Savage have some thoughts about settling down only to be brought back to their senses by Alibi, anxious to get on to their next adventure with his closing remark - \"Come on, we're ridin'.\"",

When he dies she decides to go to work as a servant until she discovers he'd left her almost 300 pounds. She decides to go to Vienna because she likes Strauss' \"Blue Danube Waltz.\" The unworldly woman soon gets into to all kinds of jams on the boat crossing the channel and then on the train across Europe. Luckily, she bumps into a salesman (Michael Redgrave) who decides to take the woman under his wing. He's also bound for Vienna where he hopes to sell a patent for a new type of washing machine.\n\nIn Vienna and with her hotel reservation fouled up, she embark to the Hotel Splendide where Redgrave is staying. They also meet two moochers: a bankrupted count (Albert Lieven) who thinks Mullen is an heiress, and a party girl (Kay Hammond) out for a good time and a free meal.\n\nAfter a week or so, Mullen is about out of money but has experienced the delights of Vienna, including hearing her favorite song. And after several mix-ups with Redgrave, she goes back home to find a job as a servant. Is she destined to a life of drudgery? Mullen is a delight as the sensible Scot who learns a thing or two on her trip. Redgrave turns in another terrific performance as the bemused salesman. Hammond and Lieven are solid. Cast also includes Wilfrid Lawson as the father, Rachel Kempson and Joan Kemp-Welch as her sisters, Katie Johnson as Mathilde, Phyllis Stanley as the neighbor. Also look for Googie Withers, Max Adrian, Sebastian Cabot, and Esme Percy.\n\nMullen's film debut.",

                "text": "...but, oh, so much more. This film is, as other posts have already indicated, a buried treasure. Produced and prepared by Lubitsch, its source is the same as that of the Lubitsch-directed silent \"Forbidden Paradise\" (1924, starring Pola Negri, Adolphe Menjou and Rod La Rocque), considered by critic Paul Rotha to be Lubitsch's most brilliant film. \"A Royal Scandal,\" surprisingly, has taken a critical drubbing over the years, and director Preminger professed not to like it. (It should be remembered, though, that Preminger, when interviewed, was often vague about his films.) Seems that Otto, though a great admirer of Lubitsch (and who was not?) did not feel comfortable with \"the Lubitsch touch,\" which, he says, too often sacrificed character for easy laughs -- and, in this case, required an empress to act unlike an empress. Perhaps -- but on the other hand, on the evidence of this film, Preminger's mastery of the Lubitsch touch was thorough. The film is brilliantly paced (rapid fire and crackling dialogue throughout), superbly acted, magnificently designed and photographed, and scored very creatively by Alfred Newman. One sees the seeds for Tallulah's famous (though by now, sadly, near forgotten) offstage character in her shameless cruising of the young soldier (William Eythe) who wants no greater glory than to be close to the throne. And at this point, she is young enough to pull it off gracefully, veering just to the edge of camp without crossing the line. Eythe is a more-than-promising comedian: his two brief blinks as the empress Catherine tells him that she can see in his eyes that he is \"good and true\" are alone worth the price of admission. (Scenes between the two of them comprise a good half of the film.) Charles Coburn is very wisely used -- a consummate reactor, he is often seen in the background tellingly reacting to two characters' interaction in the foreground. Which is not to say that he doesn't have his own very bright moments. (Catherine's chancellor, he is the character who makes all the wheels turn.) Anne Baxter brings fire and music to her role as Eythe's fianc\u00e9e, and Vincent Price brings a great deal of wit to what is little more than a cameo as the French ambassador. Mischa Auer, too, is particularly good in this film (as he is not always). For once he is not required to pull out his heavy accent and -- surprise! -- he speaks perfectly excellent English! A thoroughly entertaining film, and perhaps if its director hadn't expressed his reservations it would have a better reputation today. In my opinion, it's really stronger and more of a \"Lubitsch picture\" than most any of the (in my heretical opinion) somewhat overrated Ernst's later efforts, \"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Cluny Brown\", lovely as they are, notwithstanding: this one's a gem. Just released (March 2006) on a Columbia DVD in France. Not the most perfect print, but probably better than any seen in a theater for many, many years. (The French subtitles, on the other hand, can't be turned off, which is fairly inexcusable.) By the way, I watched this movie twice within a span of 24 hours and it was even better the second time. (Since this was written, there has been released in the U.K. a double bill DVD of this with \"Margin for Error,\" Preminger's first film, which makes it something of a bargain, though \"Margin\" is hardly essential.)",

I do have a copy of it, though, and, today, it stands as a comedy of wit, charm, and delicious mischief. Bankhead is 'mahvelous' playing it to the hilt and offering superb takes on all of her lines. Her reaction shots are among the funniest yet capture on film. No, it is not Catherine -- it is Tallulah--but this is a satirical romp and not meant to be faithful to Russian history. William Eythe, forever underrated, is perfection.A stellar comedic force (he was equally fine in more serious roles e.g. TheHouse on 92nd Street). Coburn is in the right frame of mind and action; Anne Baxter does not quite capture the spirit of the madness, but she is not bad.

                "text": "\"A Royal Scandal\" from 1945 smacks of its original director, Ernst Lubitsch, and not much of the director who took over for him when he became ill, Otto Preminger. Since Lubitsch had rehearsed the actors and prepared the script, I assume they retained much of what Lubitsch had in mind for this film. At any rate, it's a wonderfully funny film.\n\nTallulah Bankhead plays Catherine the Great, who was notorious for taking lovers and elevating them to great heights while they were in favor. They did all right when they fell out of favor, too, because apparently she pensioned them off and they lived quite handsomely. In this film, she takes a fancy to the Countess Anna's (Anne Baxter) fianc\u00e9e, Alexei Chernoff (William Eythe), so much so that she puts off a Marquis from France (Vincent Price). The Countess Anna is devastated, and Alexei is thrilled as he becomes in charge of the palace guards. Meanwhile, Chancellor Nikolai (Charles Coburn) has to tolerate him.\n\nSome of this film is laugh out loud funny, particularly the scene where Catherine, fearing she has lost Alexei, collapses on the floor and Alexei tries to pick her up. Hilarious. Tallulah's line delivery is great, and she and Coburn have wonderful chemistry as they spar. Anne Baxter was only 22 when she made this film, and she's lovely. The handsome Eythe was a type that 20th Century Fox loved, but for a variety of reasons, he never hit stardom. Darryl Zanuck, who was so furious with Tyrone Power for marrying Annabella that he quashed her career and gave Power a bad film, Daytime Wife, as punishment, pushed Eythe into a marriage to quell rumors about him, but it didn't help, and Zanuck lost interest in him. (I mention Power because supposedly he refused to do this movie - it seems unlikely, because he wasn't back from the war when this film was made; also, Zanuck would never have put him in a film where he wasn't the main star.) Eythe was a charming actor, but to my mind, anyway, not really star material.\n\nBankhead's costumes and jewelry are to die for. Very good movie, and, as others have pointed out, a real buried treasure.",

Both of those dealt with young Catherine and how in a palace coup she dethroned her husband and as the consort Empress was recognized as the actual ruler. What happens in those two films play very much into what happens in A Royal Scandal.\n\nWhat a coup accomplishes, another coup can reverse. Catherine is not all that secure on her throne. She's in the midst of a power struggle between her military leaders personified by Sig Ruman and her Chancellor who wants a peace policy capped off with an alliance with France. Chancellor Charles Coburn has even got an ambassador from Louis XV in the person of Vincent Price to seal the deal.\n\nIn all this blunders William Eythe an earnest but not terribly bright young guardsman, the kind Catherine the Great was known to fancy. She fancies him a lot, but as she says one must be wary not to put too much trust in handsome men in uniforms.\n\nSo we've got a nice little Russian court comedy going with Ruman and Coburn both trying to use Eythe for their own purposes and Bankhead who when Eythe says his sword is at her disposal, she wants to make sure she gets the most use out of it. While all this is going on, Eythe is engaged to Anne Baxter one of Tallulah's ladies in waiting. And she doesn't want a castoff when Bankhead's through with the merchandise.\n\nCoburn comes off really well as the foxy old chancellor who's survived many a palace intrigue by using his wits. Ruman's not bad either and I do love Grady Sutton's brief role as Ruman's idiot son who just wants to go back to the Urals. Sutton's southern accent actually works here as he makes the Urals sound like the Ozarks. Definitely a touch of Ernest Lubitsch.\n\nA Royal Scandal together with Lifeboat, both released in 1945 marked the height of Tallulah Bankhead's all too brief film career. Too few film parts for this stage legend, only the Lunts are worse in that regard. For that reason this bright and witty comedy should be seen and treasured.",

It is for at least the first ten minutes while the pacing remains frantically break-neck (and some necks are nearly broken). Even when it inevitably slows down, it remains lightly enjoyable for most of its 94 minutes, but Otto Preminger was decidedly the wrong director to shepherd the Lubitsch project to fruition, and too much of the blithe banter, even in the hands of such reliable clowns as Sig Ruman just misses the mark as Tallulah alternately rages at and romps with alternating 'favorites' while senior minister Coburn protects her and her country (and keeps French Ambassador Vincent Price frustratingly off screen waiting his turn with the Empress).\n\nCoburn's scenes all sparkle with his amused knowing looks and quite conspiring, and \"Guard of the East Gate\" Misha Auer makes his few scenes comic gems, but neither handsome William Eythe (a Tyrone Power hopeful who never quite caught on - bad roles hurting more than rumors about his private life) nor the raging Tallulah (taking a slight wrong turn into costume farce after a dazzling contemporary outing for Hitchcock in LIFEBOAT) are given enough substance or variety in their frustrated - intended to be comic - dance of seduction to deliver either the hilarity or the sexual tension intended. With the exception of PORGY AND BESS, did a Preminger film *ever* understand the comic aspect of sex? His closest approach to subversive comedy may be in inexplicably showing COBURN more fond of Anne Baxter (William Eythe's on screen fianc\u00e9) than Eythe appears to be - but it would be easy to miss her entirely in an underwritten role but for Coburn's concern.\n\nOther than the polished LIFEBOAT, the great Tallulah's dozen or so movies (Bette Davis kept getting to make Bankhead's greatest stage roles in film - from DARK VICTORY to the LITTLE FOXES) show up so seldom these days, and so few of them preserve the comic touch which Bankhead was known for on stage (her Broadway revival of Noel Coward's PRIVATE LIVES is still the longest running production of that great comedy and her Sabina in Thorton Wilder's THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH is justly renowned) that no one should miss a chance to see A ROYAL SCANDAL, but the great misfortune the film originally suffered of opening the day before President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died (can you think of a WORSE time for a farce/comedy to open?!) was not the only reason the film is not ranked among Lubitsch's masterpieces.\n\nStill, a Lubitsch near miss is as good as many another film maker's milestone. 'Well worth a look - and if it adds to our enjoyment to think of Ann Baxter's later role in ALL ABOUT EVE as a love letter from Tallulah to Bette, well, it isn't such a bad idea either.",

For once, he had a role that showed he had talent that should have been nurtured into full fledged stardom, but never was. He bears a strong resemblance to Tyrone Power and handles his role with authority and ease.\n\nBankhead seems on the verge of doing her Diva act at any given moment, but restricts herself to a few \"Shut up!\" remarks or slyly commenting on the fact that she'd like to do a lot for the peasants. She never misses an opportunity to give any slightly risqu\u00e9 line a clearer meaning, just from the way she glances or moves. It's a wonderfully entertaining performance.\n\nCHARLES COBURN, ANNE BAXTER, SIG RUMAN and others do their parts in fine form, but VINCENT PRICE is wasted in the role of the French ambassador who ends up becoming the new apple of Bankhead's eye. Baxter is particularly good at demonstrating that she could show flashes of temperament beneath the sweetness and charm.\n\nBest of all, the dialog is full of innocently delivered one-liners that make it one of the most enjoyable farces I've seen in years.

It pokes fun at 17th century Russian empress, Catherine the Great, at her court, at the military, and at other European countries of the time. All aspects of the production are excellent. And, the lead actors are tremendous in their roles.\n\nTop billing goes to Tallulah Bankhead as Catherine the Great. The film script fits the raucous, mostly dramatic stage actress to a tee, and she plays her role hilariously. At least equal to her is William Eythe as Lt. Alexei Chernoff. He is superb as the exuberant, somewhat na\u00efve, loyal and dashing Russian army officer who admires the czarina. He refers to her frequently as \"our little mother,\" or \"Mother Russia,\" much to her chagrin and disapproving looks. There are many laughs in the exchanges between these two.\n\nCharles Coburn has one of the meatier roles of a great career. He had played leading men in a few roles, but mostly was one of the few stellar supporting actors in many top Hollywood films. In this film he shows more than his usual facial expressions of dismay, chagrin, surprise, etc., in comedic situations. He plays Nicolai Ilyitch, the chancellor of Russia and right-hand man to the empress. In reality, he runs the country behind-the scenes, according to Catherine's wishes or best interest \u0096 as he sees it.\n\nOther supporting actors contribute to funny scenes in the film. One reviewer thought Vincent Price was wasted here. I think he is a riot as the Marquis de Fleury who is the ambassador from King Louis XV of France. Sig Ruman is another of the great supporting actors of the golden age of Hollywood. Here he plays Gen. Nicolai Ronsky. Mischa Auer is hilarious as Captain Sukov. Vladimir Sokoloff, Mikhail Rasumny, Donald Douglas, and Grady Sutton have short humorous parts.\n\nThere's a considerable track record behind \"A Royal Scandal.\" It was a silent film in 1924, \"Forbidden Paradise.\" Before that it was a Broadway play, \"The Czarina,\" written by Edward Sheldon. He adapted it from a Hungarian book and play, \"Die Zarin,\" by Lajos Biro. In all of those earlier forms, the story was successful. It was a comedy, billed as a humorous look at the 17th century Russian empress with her many amorous affairs. Yet, when this film came out in April 1945, it flopped at the box office. As a result, it has been little seen or known about since then.\n\nI suspect that timing was mostly to blame. The American public probably was confused or conflicted with the different messages it had heard and seen in the news and movies about the Soviet Union. First Stalin's communist regime had starved millions of Ukrainians and the Soviet five-year plan had failed. Then the U.S. provides arms and supplies to the Soviets as allies against Nazi Germany. And Hollywood issues a film at the urging of President Roosevelt, \"Mission to Moscow,\" in 1943 that whitewashed Stalin's atrocities. No wonder the public might be confused. In a few more years \u0096 by 1948, I think this film would have been a smashing success, and would be regarded something of a classic satire today.\n\nEven reading the comments of reviewers to the time of my writing, I find that few have seen as little more than a simple comedy. But, those who enjoy much laughter and a satire that pokes lots of fun should enjoy \"A Royal Scandal.\" It's part of my film library, along with other great satires such as \"Dr. Strangelove,\" \"The Mouse that Roared,\" \"Ninotchka,\" \"Comrade X,\" and \"To Be or Not to Be.\" Here are some sample lines to whet one's appetite. Ilyitch, \"Oh, that Louie (French pronunciation of Louis). He's really ruining France. He's worse than the 14th. And Louie the 14th was worse than the 13th. That's the trouble with France \u0096 too many Louies.\" Alexei, \"You know what's going on in Russia?\" Sukov, \"No, and please don't tell me. I don't want to get mixed up in anything. All I want to do is guard the east gate.\" Ilyitch, \"My dear marquis, I'm so embarrassed. A perfect stranger coming out of the wall.\" Marquis, \"Oh, please do not even mention. In Paris nothing but secret entrances. Only the husbands and servants use the regular doors. In the salon of Madame du Barry, you can see the best people coming out of the book shelves.\" Alexei, \"Look, here are 50 rubles. Please take me to her majesty.\" Ilyitch, \"You can't bribe the chancellor of Russia. Not with 50 rubles.\" Alexei, \"You're the chancellor? The man everybody says is ruining Russia?\" Ilyitch, \"You're from the East?\" Alexei, \"No, from the West.\" Ilyitch, \"How things do get around. It's amazing.\" Alexei, \"Your majesty, I'm ready to die for you.\" Catherine, \"That's no news either. I expect that from my soldiers.\" Ilyitch, \"I beg your majesty not to waste your precious energy. We have these minor revolutions every day.\" Alexei, \"I don't believe his excellency has a very high opinion of me. Frankly, he seems to think I'm something of a fool.\" Catherine, \"That's a lot of nonsense. You're brilliant \u0085 and you look simply divine in that uniform.\" Ilyitch, \"I even dreamed about you last night.\" Gen. Ronsky, \"Something bad?\" Ilyitch, \"I don't know yet. I'm going to dream the end tonight.\" Alexei, \"I didn't think you listened.\" Catherine, \"I remember every word, every syllable.\" Alexei, \"Then you heard what I said about the peasants?\" Catherine, \"Did I hear? How can you ask? I've been thinking of nothing else but peasants, peasants, peasants, and peasants.\"",

I'm quite pleased I did.\n\nFilmed very much as the stage play it originally was, this movie is quite funny, as quick-witted and slow-witted characters face off. Bankhead makes a wonderfully larger-than-life queen and Coburn is excellent as a sly chancellor. \n\nThere's not a lot to the story, and at times I would feel a little distracted (the great difficulty of watching movies at home amidst one's other toys), but it was funny - sometimes very funny - and even though Preminger took over the direction due to Lubitch's illness, it has that Lubitch quality to it. There are better Lubitch films, but there are also worse ones, so I'd say Preminger did a good job.",

                "summary": "The future Eve Harrington takes on the real Margo Channing.",
                "text": "It's no secret that the Bette Davis character of Margo Channing in \"All About Eve\" was a take-off on the ego-centric Tallulah Bankhead, \"the Alabama Foghorn\" who threatened \"to rip every hair out of her mustache\" when she saw Davis's alleged interpretation of her. While the real life Tallulah was certainly far more eccentric than Davis's subtle interpretation of Margo, on-screen here she's faced with a challenge; Playing opposite Anne Baxter, the rising young leading lady who would go onto screen immortality playing the opportunistic Eve. It's fair to say that the still somewhat green Baxter could easily have been swallowed alive by the campy Bankhead, but she more or less holds her own against Bankhead in several confrontation scenes in this costume drama which is more fantasy than Russian history even if it is the reign of Catherine the Great which this comic burlesque surrounds.\n\n\"You rode three days and three nights?\" the incredulous Bankhead keeps asking Lieutant William Eythe, the devoted officer reporting possible treason to her majesty. His devotion to her continued efforts as \"Mother Russia\" (a phrase she openly despises) brings out both her thanks and her lust as she looks on the much younger Eythe, making him captain of the guard in her palace, unaware that he's engaged to the 22 year old Baxter, the somewhat meek young lady-in-waiting whose most challenging job is picking out the right wardrobe for \"her highness\" to wear to the next elaborate ball. Manipulation by Catherine's \"right-hand man\" (a delightful Charles Coburn) keeps Baxter from revealing the truth to Bankhead, but eventually, after some champagne, glass smashing and smooching with the Empress, Eythe reveals all, resulting in him discovering just what his newest paramour is all about. A threat of revolution breaks out, and Eythe is at risk of being hung for being a traitor. And still the ambassador from Louis XIV's court awaits, giving poor Vincent Price nothing to do but look rather uncomfortable and silly in wigs.\n\nComing the year after Mae West got laughs for just calling \"Enter!\" on Broadway in \"Catherine Was Great\", Bankhead's performance is equally as bombastic and certainly as much of a burlesque. Sort of ironic considering that West was famous for the line, \"I used to be snow white, but I drifted\", and Bankhead quipped, \"I'm as pure as the driven slush.\" At times, Bankhead highly resembles Dietrich (\"The Scarlet Empress\") and at other times, she reminds me of the type of roles which Judith Anderson might have played on stage, although much more seriously. In fact, their voices were quite similar, although Anderson did not have the obvious Southern drawl. Another piece of irony is the fact that the following year, Bankhead had a huge flop on Broadway in a costume epic called \"The Eagle Has Two Heads\" (to which she famously changed from eagle to turkey in her usual droll way in interviews) which was also about an extravagant Queen facing rebellion. Bankhead isn't the only one whose American presence defies their casting as Russian nobility; Grady Sutton has an even stronger drawl as another member of Bankhead's court.\n\nElaborate and luscious to look at, this suffers from a lack of outdoors scenes, making its stage origins all the more obvious. Tallulah seems to be having a grand old time, however, and if she did as rumor would have it try to upstage Baxter, it doesn't show. She did credit Coburn with being a more than welcome addition to the cast because as she said, \"He'll steal every scene right out of my nose\", but Coburn plays it subtle. Eythe seems at first a bit too much of a novice to compete with either of his leading ladies, but he really stands out in comical scenes whether beating up another former captain of the guard, destroying the room where a traitorous general awaits, or finally, breaking into Bankhead's room in the middle of the night as traitorous members of her military approach the palace to depose her. This might have been a bigger hit if made before the onslaught of World War II, but it stands the test of time and gives today's audiences a chance to see one of the all time queen of camp at work, and she is far from looped!",

                "summary": "A ROYAL SCANDAL (Otto Preminger and, uncredited, Ernst Lubitsch, 1945) **1/2",
                "text": "This was begun by Ernst Lubitsch (who also produced) but, after suffering a heart attack, handed over the directorial reins to Preminger (who eventually received sole credit for it!) \u0096 as would happen all over again 3 years later when Lubitsch died early on during the production of the Ruritanian Technicolor musical THAT LADY IN ERMINE (1948)! The film under review is actually a Talkie remake of Lubitsch's Silent success FORBIDDEN PARADISE (1924; which seems to be available solely via an incomplete print boasting Czech intertitles!). It is yet another movie dealing with the reign of Catherine II of Russia, known as \"The Great\"; however, this was made at Fox instead of Paramount (Lubitsch had been Head Of Production there at the time of Josef von Sternberg's magnificent THE SCARLET EMPRESS {1934}). The tone is very different, too: being a comic romantic souffl\u00e9 as opposed to a flamboyant epic (even if the Queen's various dalliances were still a major plot point of the Sternberg movie), this one ostensibly offered pure wartime escapism\u0085but the result is so flat as to be insulting (depicting potentates as fickle figures concerning themselves with frivolities and rewarding soldiers over their bedroom antics rather than military tactics was hardly wise under such precarious circumstances!), much more so in fact than the accusations of bad taste levelled at Lubitsch's satirical \u0096 but not unfeeling \u0096 masterpiece TO BE OR NOT TO BE (1942)! \n\nDespite the typical studio gloss, a most able cast (led by Tallulah Bankhead as a not-so-young Catherine, Charles Coburn as her wily Chancellor, William Eythe breaking into the Palace bearing old news{!} but remaining to become the Queen's new favorite, Anne Baxter in an ALL ABOUT EVE {1950} dry-run as her lady-in-waiting and catty rival for the latter's affections, Vincent Price as the fey French ambassador who spends almost the entire running-time waiting to be received by Catherine{!}, a typically pompous Sig Rumann as the high-ranking officer planning a coup d'etat, Mischa Auer as a flustered sentry and Vladimir Sokoloff as a Palace adjutant) and a script by Edwin Justus Mayer (who also wrote the afore-mentioned Nazi lampoon), the film looks decidedly claustrophobic, is filled with deliberately overstated performances, and comes across as distinctly heavy-handed. Whether all this is the humorless Preminger's doing, however, is hard to determine \u0096 since, it must also be said, the famed \"Lubitsch Touch\" is barely in evidence throughout! Mind you, the picture is not unamusing per se (though hardly as witty as one would have expected given some of the people involved!) and it clearly gets by on sheer professionalism alone: what I find inexcusable is that such money and talent were squandered on an essentially silly, empty charade \u0096 and an incessantly verbose one at that!",

I am old enough to appreciate subtle humor but this picture is far too subtle for today's average viewer. I think Lubitsch needed more of a hand in this production, even though he is the nominal producer. He was taken ill and directorial duties were handed over to Otto Preminger.\n\nIn any case, it is another chance to view a national treasure in Talullah Bankhead, who made very few movies - and that's our loss. She gets good support from Charles Coburn, and not much from William Eythe. His performance was one-note and strident and he seemed ill-at-ease as her officer-lover. He was billed as the 'next Tyrone Power', who was himself an underrated actor. I felt Eythe nearly sank the picture by himself with his shrill heavy-handedness. Vincent Price plays the French ambassador, and with a very bad French accent.\n\nI just felt that this picture was not in the same league with other Lubitsch films and his definitive touch was not so much in evidence. It was disappointing in this regard, and the script needed to be funnier.",

Then there is Charles Coburn in his usual take charge position as the treasurer. A sly fox, he knows which way the wind is blowing.\n\nVincent Price briefly appears with his French accent as a count, who charms the heart of the great queen.",

I don't know at what point Preminger took over for Lubitch when he died and perhaps Lubitch might have wound up making it sophisticated and comic even for today (as he did others, notably Trouble in Paradise); but Preminger was the wrong choice to complete this one. Tallulah, who sparkled on Broadway (when young, I saw her in Private Lives), was so-what? here. She read her lines well enough, but the dialogue itself was mediocre and predictable. Much blame must go to writer Edwin Justus Mayer (of the delighful Midnight), who faltered here.",

She sings \"When The Dark Became Dawn\" which is worth watching for. Jackie Ward is the star of this film, even though Nina gets top billing. Jackie Ward is no younger then 12 or 13, but a good actor and good singer. Nina Mae does some great acting, no stereotype, or dumb talking or acting stupid. The only way Blacks could and show their talent was in Independent Black Movies and be movie stars within their own race, but unknown to other races, and they deserved better. A lot of the films have been hidden, and the history of Black Movies. But a lot of them are starring to get released. Only if Hollywood would of gave Blacks a chance in movies, were they scared Blacks would eclipse the white actors and actresses? I always felt the Black community needed Black stars and pin-up girls. I guess Hollywood felt Blacks couldn't keep a movie audience, that we couldn't act. But if you watch these films you will see differently.",

                "text": "I don't know where we would be without TCM. Turner shows us a lot of movies that are obscure and have no hope of ever surfacing on DVD. This film isn't even mentioned in Leonard Maltin's TV Movies and Video Guide, so this vehicle is REALLY obscure. Because of these things, this film doesn't stand a chance at being touted by todays marketing people. However, these films offer us a glimpse of life past, of certain values and lifestyles that may appear \"corny\" to us today. \n\nThis movie has a lot to offer; the music is catchy and well orchestrated. There is also a well choreographed dance routine by three guys And, most important, director Leigh Jason had the right tools in regard to a cast. Much traveled Marjorie Reynolds plays Ann Stallings. Reynolds, a gorgeous, curvy blonde with brown eyes is best known for her performance in Holiday Inn (1942) with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Almost exclusively appearing in B- films, Reynolds made a splash in Paramount's Holiday Inn. She sings and dances just as well in Meet Me on Broadway. \n\nThe film is supported by long time actor Allen Jenkins (loaned out by Warner Brothers), Gene Lockhart, known for his villainous and conniving roles as a character actor, but appearing quite tame in this film. Also, there's Spring Byington, another busy actress from the 1930's and '40's. Little known and little used Fred Brady is placed in a principal role as Eddie Dolan. Brady is sort of a Danny Kaye wannabe as demonstrated in both his actions and speech. I feel that this was a major mistake by Columbia as his role appears weak throughout the film. Brady only made a handful of films and quickly went into obscurity several years later. \n\nThis film was completed in late 1945 and a welcome site for many moviegoers who were weary of war-related plots. The going theme during this period was \"Peace, it's wonderful!\". The many trials and tribulations for America were yet to come, so this brief period of time was a respite between the most destructive war in history and what was to follow in the next few years.",

                "text": "What a pity the excellent cast and staging talent used here was thrown away on a B- movie length and style opus which only offers minor (and more than a little stereotyped) pleasures when so much more was promised.\n\nMale lead Fred Brady (looking and sounding like Bobby Van - which may tell you the level of star power involved) plays Eddie Dolan a wanna-be Broadway producer who has hired on to stage a wealthy community theatre benefit in hopes of making contacts to finance the show he wants to do on Broadway - especially when he finds a talented singer in Jinx Falkenberg in his cast, screen daughter of rich Gene Lockhart.\n\nNaturally, comic confusion and jealous repercussions (Brady's girlfriend, Marjorie Reynolds is also in the show) ensue. Reliable studio character second banana Allen Jenkens turns in yeoman work as Dolan's assistant/stage manager - and while he's a perfectly dreadful stage manager, he's a great comic presence that more than once shows what a fun film this almost was.\n\nThe real gem of the film though is Spring Byington (years before her TV series, \"December Bride\") as the wife of Dolan's potential investor. Byington's character has a secret - unimportant to the plot but much brighter than the mother's \"secret\" in THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER. Suffice to say that her smile lights up every set she graces and screams \"this is a STAR\" whenever she's on the screen. She plays the role for all it's worth and once again leaves us asking why the film as a whole isn't better. \n\nChoreographer Jack Cole had by this point not yet finally lost his legendary screen assistant Gwen Verdon to Broadway, but she WAS making her stage debut in something called SHOOTING STAR this year (it closed on the road) and is not in evidence on screen here. The uncredited male dancers get the best of Cole's attention and most of his signature moves. It's a pity they aren't to greater effect, but the whole film is very minor entertainment. \n\nFor free on late night TV (most of us apparently have discovered the piece on the same Turner Classic Movie screening), it's worth sticking a tape or DVD-R in the machine, but don't hold your breath for a major DVD release or big screen showing unless someone is kind enough to put out a discount Spring Byington box or run an Allen Jenkens Festival.",

But Reynolds balks then walks, leaving him high and dry with no star and perhaps no investor. In the meantime, his partner (Allen Jenkins) gets a sense of de ja vue with society matron Spring Byington who has a secret past.\n\nA third subplot, practically minor, is the desire of young heiress Jinx Falkenburg to get into the show, and convenient that wants her father (Gene Reynolds) to invest in his show.\n\nThe songs are totally unmemorable, but a few production numbers are lavishly staged. But it goes to say that this is no \"Cover Girl\". It's professionally done, but like many other programmers, rushed out without consideration of quality.",

Did the producer demand a score and give them only 15 minutes? All of the songs here seem like they were thrown together in a hurry, and are totally forgettable.\n\nChoreographer Jack Cole is already using the newer style of dancing that was to dominate movie musicals later in the 1950s. Yet, his work here appears to be suppressed by a lack of budget and a lack of space. The dancers always seem to be crammed together.\n\nJean Louis designed the gowns, so at least all of the female characters are well-dressed.\n\nSo while there is A-quality cast and crew, the end result is a disappointment that looks suspiciously like a B movie.

                "summary": "An intelligent examination of \"freedom\"",
                "text": "What's most remarkable about \"The Russian Quesion\" is the sophistication of the its portrayal of the conflicts of interest that surface even in a so-called free society. The political and cultural taboos that force people to tell convenient lies rather than interrogate conventional wisdom are laid open in the film, and treated with intelligence and nuance. Given the failures of the \"free\" press during the run-up to the Iraq War and the Bush administration's trampling of civil liberties in the name of the \"war\" on terrorism over the past seven years, the film's concerns are strikingly topical even 60 years after its creation.\n\nObviously, there would have been much to criticize about a USSR still under Stalin's iron grip in the late 1940s, but just because the film's politics happen to suit the propaganda needs of the Soviets (how could they not?) doesn't mean they're irrelevant or incorrect as criticisms of U.S. society which, then as now, makes extravagant, and sometimes hollow, claims to its liberty and democratic vigor.\n\nI give a great deal of credit to the director, Mikhail Romm (a well-known and able filmmaker who managed to make intelligent work like this even under the constraints of Stalinism), for his ability to maintain his focus on a critique of these claims of Western society rather than get bogged down in praising the USSR - a virtual requirement for most Stalinist film-making. For example, when the journalist makes a trip to Russia, I fully expected to get rosy and extended depictions of life in a \"socialist paradise\". But Romm shrewdly avoids excessive paeans to socialism, largely by limiting this section of the film to a brief montage showing parades, factories, and other stereotypical hallmarks of Soviet publicity. He then immediately returns the film to New York and the reporter's ongoing dilemma: telling the truth as he sees it - even if it means ending his career - or relating politically expedient falsehoods about Soviet society that will put him in good stead with the powers that be.\n\nIn sum, I found \"The Russian Question\" to be a good deal more penetrating and thoughtful, as an analysis of \"freedom,\" than any corresponding document I've seen produced in the West about totalitarian socialism. Virtually every example of this kind of cinema I've encountered that emanated from Hollywood during the Cold War tends to be more or less hysterical and simple-minded in its depiction of the wicked, evil Commies.",

                "text": "'Russian Question' is flat-out Soviet propaganda, with all the clumsiness of that regime's usual cinematic agitprop. What makes this movie slightly more interesting than its brethren is that, whereas most Russian propaganda movies extol the alleged virtues of the Soviet \"worker's paradise\", this one sets out to slag the United States. The central character in 'Russian Question' is an American (played by a Russian actor). Even more originally, rather than depict this American as a stereotyped capitalist, he is depicted as heroically in sympathy with the Soviet agenda: those OTHER Americans are the problem.\n\nHarold Smith (the name suggests an Everyman) is a crusading American journalist who has gone to Moscow to see for himself the truth about the Soviet regime. This being a Soviet movie, of course he's favourably impressed. When he returns Stateside, he receives a job offer from a publisher named MacFerson. The latter is very obviously based on William Randolph Hearst, and possibly also based on a couple of other tabloid publishers such as Bernarr MacFadden. (Notice the similar surnames: MacFadden, MacFerson.) The publisher, being a capitalist, is only interested in selling newspapers ... and is perfectly willing to disseminate lies rather than the truth, if lies will sell more papers. Oh, and he's also interested in starting up a war ... because nothing else sells more newspapers.\n\nMacFerson offers Smith lots of rubles (I mean dollars) to write a book about the Soviet Union, but he wants Smith to depict the Soviets as war-mongers. Smith refuses to see the Russians as war-mongers when he recalls how bravely the Red Army fought against the Nazis. (Huh? The fight against the Nazis was justified, but that hardly proves that the Russians were pacifists.) When Smith refuses to lie for MacFerson, the latter uses his media influence to slander Smith as a traitor to the United States ... slandering him so deeply that even Smith's wife Meg falls for the lies, and deserts him. The Russian actress playing Meg is tricked out in enormous shoulder pads, an elaborate peplum, and hair pulled back so severely, I had difficulty perceiving her as an American.\n\nSPOILERS COMING. There's a 'happy' ending ... by which I mean, an ending that suits the Soviet agenda. Eventually, Smith realises that the problem isn't merely MacFerson but rather the entire Wall Street-Washington axis, of which MacFerson is a mere cog. Smith proclaims that the real enemies of the United States aren't in the Soviet Union ... they're in (wait for it) Washington! Pass the borscht, comrade.\n\nAccording to the film's credits, this movie is based on a Russian stage play, by one Konstantin Simonov. I can well believe it: despite some elaborate sets, much of this film is directed as if it were a filmed stage play rather than a motion picture. What really annoys me is that this movie actually does what it accuses Uncle Sam (or Aunt Sally) of doing: lying to the public in order to tar the republic on the other side of the Iron Curtain. We see here sequences of the American media -- a very UN-free press -- suppressing Smith's efforts to tell the truth ... when in fact this is exactly what the Soviet government were doing at this time to samizdat publishers. Indeed, a post-glasnost Russian cultural official has told me that Simonov later recanted everything said in this movie. There's no question about 'The Russian Question': it's lies, all lies, and it doesn't even tell those lies very gracefully nor credibly. My rating for this agitating agitprop: just 3 out of 10, mostly for the impressive production design.",

And what a delight it is to watch. Initially when I read that this was a courtroom drama exposing the workings of the coroner's court, I thought it would be dry beyond belief and more than a little dull given the era.\n\nNot at all. In fact, this is almost a comedy, with the cast giving occasionally histrionic turns as the script requires, and it's certainly very funny despite the deadly serious nature of the narrative. In essence, a young woman is accused of her husband's murder when her gun is found hidden behind a wall and missing a bullet that was lodged in her husband's back.\n\nThe rest of the story is made up of the court trial as the facts of the case go back and forth. And what this all boils down to in actuality is a battle of wits between the fussy and old-fashioned coroner, played by Herbert Lomas, and the idealistic KC, played with relish by Hay Petrie. These two guys argue their points, engage in shouting matches, and overact with relish. They alone are responsible for much of this film's entertainment value, such as it is, and both actors deserve commendations for making the antics of their characters so enjoyable to watch.",

We observe their hysterical rantings, intercut with favorable reactions from the massed audiences of supporters as they offer salutes and pay tribute to their leaders' achievements. \n\nThis sense of triumphalism is cleverly undercut by Thomas's words - spoken by an English commentator - that focus on on the Nazi leaders' antisemitism, their innate prejudice against anyone daring to countermand their words, and their potential to destroy young minds. Their insidious power is emphasized; their ability to rabble-rouse through fire and brimstone, that needs to be understood for what it is - nothing more than pure propaganda.\n\nTHESE ARE THE MEN is a chilling reminder of just how dangerous the Nazi threat was to world stability during the darkest years of World War II, and how viewers of this propaganda film had to be mindful, not only of what people were saying and how they were saying it.",

But in this cartoon, Tom gets literally tortured by other cats and takes a lot abuse physically and verbally for no reason, except incredible meanness.\n\nIn the house he resides in, at least in this cartoon, some idiot little girl dresses him up as a baby complete with bonnet and diapers, puts him in a little crib, scolds him and then - thankfully - leaves. At Tom enjoys the bottle of milk she left him. In fact, he loves the milk so much he doesn't mind acting like a baby while he's enjoying the drink. Jerry is watching him go goo-goo over the milk and makes fun of him. In no time, the usual chase is on, but only until the brat comes back.\n\nOnce again Tom has to endure this obnoxious girl. In all, it happens three times. Between the second and third, Jerry summons the neighborhood cats in to tease Tom about his outfit and baby acting. It becomes more than teasing and the cartoon becomes almost shocking in its sadism\n\nThere were some funny scenes but not enough to overcome the mean spirit in this animated short.",

This leads to a lengthy slapstick sequence in which Tom is bullied relentlessly, and maybe it's because he's dressed as a toddler that I found this quite hard to take, especially the part where his head is blown up like a balloon and later stamped on repeatedly. I'm no wimp and I usually love violent cartoons, but this seemed too close to child abuse for comfort.

The modern narration, still as brilliantly witty as ever, juxtaposes with the setting very well and never jars, giving us the sense that despite this setting that we are still watching a cartoon in the vein of the How To sports shorts. The animation is beautiful, with lots of fluidity and colour, while the music enhances the action beautifully by its typical energy and character. Goofy is stellar in every one of his roles, playing the comedy brilliantly as well as being endearing. The voice work is also very good. Overall, a Goofy classic, a must-watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The animation is unremarkable, but the story, written by the celebrated Bill Peet, is humorous.\n\nWalt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by drawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a\nblizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.",

Representing the forces of good against the forces of evil in this Monogram series, the three stalwarts have arrived separately and apparently unknown to each other into the plagued town, Roberts as a cattle buyer, Hatton as Sandy Hopkins, a cattle dealer, and McCoy as Parson McCall, an itinerant preacher, and quickly come up against Steve Taggart (Tristram Coffin), the ringleader of the bandit gang they seek. Roberts volunteers as a stage driver for the company owned by Ruth Masters (Luana Walters), but is framed with the responsibility for the holdups transferred to him and it falls to the other two Riders to rescue their jailed comrade, giving Jones, aboard his splendid steed Silver, an opportunity to display his riding and stunt ability in one of his final appearances before his untimely death in Boston's Cocoanut Grove fire the following year.

All had begun their careers in the early silent pictures and had continued working regularly into the 1930s in a assorted series for a variety of companies,\n\nWith the popularity of Republic's Three Mesquiteer series, other \"B\" studios began to want to get on the band wagon. Monogram had started with the Range Buster series with Ray \"Crash\" Corrigan, John \"Dusty\" King and Max Terhune. Then someone had the idea of teaming Jones and McCoy, both of whom had seen their careers decline by the end of the 30s, in a series. What resulted was \"The Rough Riders\". Jones, McCoy and Hatton played undercover marshals who were called in to settle a situation at the beginning of each film.\n\nJones played Buck Roberts who usually posed as an outlaw. McCoy played Tim McCall who usually posed as a parson and Hopkins played Sandy Hopkins a grizzled old timer who often acted as a go between between Roberts and McCall.\n\nIn this first of eight Rough Rider films, the boys are called in to help save heroine Ruth Masters (Luana Walters) stage line. Ruth, in true \"B\" western fashion tries to carry on after her father has been murdered. Trying to gain control of the line is villain Steve Taggert (Tristram Coffin) and his henchman Red (Slim Whitaker). Dennis Moore plays Walters love interest.\n\nDevoid of the usual bar room brawls and with less action than most, the Rough Rider series was nevertheless lifted above the average through the presence of its three stars. All three had been in the business for many years and their collective experience made this a memorable series.\n\nAt the end of each film the three would ride off in different directions, Jones to Arizona, McCoy to Wyoming and Hatton to Texas. The producers had planned to continue the series into a second season but fate intervened.\n\nWith the US entry into WWII, McCoy, a reserve Colonel, was called back into service. He left the series after the seventh film. Jones made the last one with Hatton and Rex Bell. Following the completion of \"Dawn On the Great Divide\" in 1942, Jones died tragically in a fire in Boston. The next season, Raymond Hatton took his Sandy Hopkins character to a new series with Johnny Mack Brown. Evidently, scripts intended for the Rough Rider series were utilized in the Brown/Hatton series.\n\nAt any rate the Rough Rider series allowed veteran cowpokes Jones and McCoy to ride off into the sunset one last time with their heads held high.\n\nWatch for fellow \"B\" hero Bob Baker in a cameo as Marshal Bat Madison near the end of the film.",

No one apparently knows who's behind this, but I thought it was obvious about five minutes into the film!! \n\nNow you'd think that this would make this a bad film, but it's actually pretty good for a B-movie--even with all this familiarity. It's one of eight 'Rough Riders' films. They starred Buck Jones, Tim McCoy (one of my favorites) and Raymond Hatton. The series was cut short when Jones was killed in a fire and soon after, McCoy took a break from films. It's a shame, as the films were pretty agreeable and McCoy was a better actor and more interesting than his contemporaries. Unlike the likes of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, he was not a pretty boy who crooned. Instead, he was a real-life war hero, cowboy and trick shooter. Plus, I think he was a pretty decent actor--playing a pretty wide variety of undercover roles in films (such as a Spanish bandit, a professional gambler and even (uggh) a Chinese guy!). Here, he pretends to be a preacher and manages to pick up very quickly on whose the jerk behind the problems.\n\nOverall, the film is tight and well-done despite everything and seemed to have some nice twists here and there--especially at the end.

No one can figure out who could be plotting against them or what they would want on the ranch it having no mineral value of any kind.\n\nAlong for the ride are Gabby Hayes as the Flint/Evans foreman and a clan of gypsies headed by chief Nestor Paiva and his most fetching daughter Estelita Rodriguez. Some really good scenes are involving Paiva and Gabby as Paiva gives some credence to the ethnic stereotyping of gypsies being really shrewd traders and downright cheats. In fact that last gag on Gabby involves a federal crime. That might have carried a joke too far.\n\nBob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers aid Roy in singing Nolan's own composition Cool Water and Roy and Dale sing Along The Navajo Trail which was having a real burst of popularity with the best selling record that Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters made of it. And there's a really nice car chase scene, more typical of today's films where the villain meets a bad end.\n\nLot's of reasons for folks of all ages to like Along The Navajo Trail.",

Roy soon uncovers a land swindle plot masterminded by J. Richard Bentley and his no-account henchman Rusty Channing (Douglas Fowley and Roy Barcroft)to grab the ranch for an oil pipeline right-of-way. With the help of Gabby Whitaker (Hayes) and an itinerant band of gypsies Roy sets to bring the scalawags to justice.\n\n\"Along the Navajo Trail\" is directed by Frank McDonald who helmed a handful of Roy's Movies between the Joseph Kane years and the later William Whitney films. McDonald began to transition Roy's movies from the World War II years musical extravaganzas to more of the automobile-age western format, though this one still features Roy singing several tunes, gone are the large scale song and dance numbers. Additionally The Son's of the Pioneers sing their iconic classic Cool Water. The following year McDonald would direct what many fans consider Roy's best movie My Pal Trigger.\n\nWhile Navajo Trail is a pretty average effort, most of Roy's fans and B-Western fans in general, will enjoy this one. 66 minutes of decent entertainment.\n\n5 of 10 stars",

All this is upset when the mayor's little daughter is injured and needs an operation.\n\nThe little daughter of the mayor is a stand out character.  The part is well cast and very funny.  At one point she meddles in her teen brother's love life by trying to give his rival the mumps.  When she can't seem to get the rival to lick a mump infested sucker, she licks it herself and kisses him on the lips.  Her brother never finds out, and ends up jilting the girl he had been chasing.  The movie spends more time on the brother's love life than that of the little girl, but the girl's adventures are much more entertaining.\n\nThis movie is worth renting and watching with the whole family.

                "text": "This is the fifth of the six Dr. Christian movies I have seen. Unfortunately, this one was produced by Alpha Video--a company with a very poor track record on DVD quality. Not surprisingly, the copy I saw was fuzzy and the sound rather low. I've seen far worse Alpha films, but I have long noticed that they never do restoration work on the films (not that I could notice, at least). However, in some cases this is the only source for a film. If you can find one from another DVD manufacturer, I say try that one first. I appreciate what films Alpha brings us...I just am not thrilled with the prints.\n\nThis is the first of the series and because the films were all made so close together, they have unusually good continuity--with the same basic cast throughout the run. In addition, this was a radio series and TV series in the 1950s.\n\nOddly, unlike the other five films, this one doesn't really seem to have much in the way of plot. There are plot elements, but no real theme. Sure, Dr. Christian is a nice guy and his patient's keep him dirt poor partly because they are poor and partly because the good doctor is so gosh-darn selfless. Some themes that come up during the film are a bratty (and creepy) little girl who is in love, the object of her affection (a teen boy) falling for Christian's nurse, the need for a hospital, an intransigent town council and an introduction to some of the town's people and their uninteresting problems (such as the town hypochondriac). Naturally, by the end, they all work themselves out and everyone FINALLY appreciates Christian--at least until the next film! \n\nBecause of this meandering nature, this is clearly one of the weakest film in the series--though the sixth one is worse because of all the sappy singing (uggh). It's all pleasant enough, but not especially deep or memorable and the writing, at times, seems a bit broad. Also, considering how good some of the later films are, it's worth seeing this film--just remember that they do get better.\n\nBy the way, is it just me or do the people of Christian's small town all seem just a bit selfish in all the movies? They always seem to take the good doctor for granted. Just once, I wanted to see him refuse to treat a patient, call people names, curse or leave to open a practice in a more deserving town!!

Hersholt certainly has Barrymore beat in the bedside manner department. But both are competent medical professionals.\n\nIn this film Hersholt runs afoul of the town's big mover and shaker Paul Harvey despite the fact that Hersholt has been his family physician as well for decades. They clash in the matter of their town of River's End needing a hospital there. Harvey has bigger plans, at least bigger in his mind than a hospital. Some tragedy close to home convinces him that maybe Dr. Christian is right. He also gets a new perspective on how lucky his community is to have Hersholt around.\n\nIn real life Jean Hersholt's charitable work was a legend around the film capital and no small wonder that the Motion Picture Academy started a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. That image blends well with the Dr. Christian image conveyed in Meet Dr. Christian and the Dr. Christian films that followed. \n\nI wish all the physicians were as noble and kind as Jean Hersholt was as Dr. Christian.",

Dr. Christian is a small time doctor who often accepts produce (usually tomatoes) as payment from his patients in lieu of money. This is to the chagrin of his housekeeper Mrs. Hastings (nicely played by Maude Eburne). The doctor's only source of steady income is his work as doctor for the local factory (a job he loses) and as the town's health commissioner. It is the doctor's and other town peoples' dream that the town, River's Edge, have its own hospital. Influential factory owner John Hewitt is the new efficient take-charge mayor. Good things happen for the town but not a new hospital. Hewitt (Paul Harvey) thinks Dr. Christian is inefficient and spends too much money as health commissioner and summarily and publicly fires him. However, when Dr. Christian saves the life of his daughter, Hewitt is finally appreciative of Dr. Christian's skill. A side story line is the teenage Don Hewitt's on again, off again romance with fickle Marilee and the interference of his sister (the same little girl later saved by Dr. Christian). Hewitt's daughter is a fun character \u0096 the fight scene at the beginning of the movie and the episode with her trying to give her brother's rival the mumps are especially good. She steals every scene she's in. While Dr. Christian's forgiving, chronically positive nature seems too good to be true, it is still nice to think that both great skill and compassion can go hand-in-hand.

The Eastern author frequently voiced his disgust over the realization of his cowboy hero in the movies. Things were a might more personal in 1930's Hollywood than they are today, and someone took a notion to teach Mulford a thing or two about the movies. The result is the wonderful Hopalong parody, Sunset Trail.\n\nMulford is merrily satirized in the character of E. Prescott Furbush, an author of western novels. Furbush, who never having been west of Flatbush, nevertheless has gained fame recording the deeds of the western desperado, Deadeye Dan. After years of fashioning fairy tales, the little fussbudget books a stay at a dude ranch to savor the `real' West. But his antics pale beside those of another dude, William H. Cassidy, or Harold, as he's known among the other guests at the ranch.\n\nHoppy has been sent to deal with land grabbers and assumes the identity of the inept Easterner, Harold, as cover. Forget the plot; it's predictable. What is not routine is Bill Boyd's performance. There is a swagger in his walk and a gleam in his eye reminiscent of the sharp-dressed, high-living Boyd of the 1920's. He deftly handles the comedy and energetically pokes fun at the Cassidy image. One of the most outstanding moments comes when Harold offers to compare surgical scars with a female guest who has been regaling Furbush with tales of her poor health.\n\nThis episode may not appeal to everyone's sense of humor, but for me it is a\nfinal glimpse of Bill Boyd, being as wickedly funny as he is handsome before he permanently transformed himself into the stalwart cowboy hero.\n",

In this one, he starts out in black & then dresses as a dude in a white hat & sports jacket to go undercover. And sure enough, it's a so-so entry in the Hoppy series, not bad, but not great either. Gabby Hayes has a good role in this one. Worst scene: Russell Hayden (as \"Lucky\") plays guitar with the guitar invisible to the camera, while his romantic interest sings a western song in the finest pop-operetta style!

Cassidy to get the goods on Keller and his gang.\n\n Boyd camps it up in a tweed suit and derby hat and seems to have a lot of fun doing it. He is seen in his regular black outfit only at the beginning and end of the movie. Hayes meanwhile is pursued throughout the movie by Abigail Snodgrass (Kathryn Sheldon). Hayden competes with Keller's hench man Steve Dorman (Anthony Nace) for Clayton's affections. The whole thing is brought to a climax in a rousing finale shootout where Hoppy brings the bad guys to justice.\n\n As in most of the \"Hoppys\", the photography, in this case by Russell Harlan, is outstanding. The direction by Leslie Selander is crisp and keeps the story moving. Watch for veterans Glenn Strange and Tom London in minor roles.\n\n Great fun.  ",

            "In the 22nd film of the series John Marsh, a successful rancher, decides to retire to Sacramento with his wife, Ann, and his daughter, Dorrie, in order to give Dorrie a good education. Monte Keller, owner of the Silver City Casino, buys Marsh's cattle for $30,000, then waylays the stagecoach, shoots Marsh dead from ambush, and takes the money from his pocket. Ann reports to the Superintendent of the stage company, and gives him the numbers of some of the bank notes. He suggests that Ann should open a dude ranch and promises to send her some guests, among them his friend William H. Cassidy. Working undercover for the stage line, \"Lucky\" Jenkins and \"Windy\" Halliday come to Silver City while their friend, \"Hopalong\" Cassidy arrives at the ranch as an eastern dude costumed in furry chaps, a vest made from a spotted cowhide and a bow-tie. Ann is a bit disappointed to learn that the man who is going to get her money recovered is a nervous man who can't even mount a horse properly. Cassidy frequents the casino and soon wins one of the stolen notes in a poker game. This leads him to the ranch's foreman, Steve Dorman, and then to the big boss."

                "text": "My only prior experience with Peter Lorre's work was in two of my favorite Humphrey Bogart films, as Joel Cairo in \"The Maltese Falcon\", and as the scheming Ugarte in \"Casablanca\". Both characterizations were excellent and memorable efforts. His casting as a Japanese \"International Police\" investigator is almost as offbeat as Boris Karloff's portrayal of Mr. Wong in that series of mystery films of the same era.\n\nLorre actually portrays two characters, besides Moto he operates undercover as antiques shop keeper Kuroki. From that vantage point, he tries to keep tabs on a band of international saboteurs who intend to blow up the French fleet as it enters the Suez Canal. The group is led by \"Fabian the Great\" (Ricardo Cortez), who plays in theater shows as a ventriloquist, and includes Eric Norvel (George Sanders), and Danforth (John Carradine). Danforth is actually a British Agent attempting to hook up with Moto, and his knowledge of Fabian's plans is intentionally less than complete.\n\nPay attention to the scene when Fabian first suspects that Danforth is not what he seems. He uses a pen to scribble a beard on a photo of British Intelligence Agent Richard Burke in a notebook dossier. The beard he draws ends in a straight line under Burke's chin. In a later scene, when Fabian shows the photo to Norvel, the beard is thicker and descends with a point toward Burke's collar. The actual beard Carradine wears in his role looks quite humorously phony, and makes one thankful for present day film makeup.\n\nThe mystery here is rather straightforward, no murders to solve and no red herrings as in the Charlie Chan franchise. We know who the bad guys are right from the start, and the only revelation needed is how Moto will save the day. This he does by escaping from an underwater death trap and by prematurely detonating the mines intended for the French ships, thereby providing them with enough warning to turn around. As a murderous saboteur, Fabian proves rather inept, as he fails to properly dispatch Moto, and earlier his girlfriend Connie (Virginia Field) who discovers his plot. Too bad, as Connie does the honors of stopping Fabian during his tussle with Moto.\n\nPeter Lorre doesn't look like a very physical guy, small in stature and kind of mousy, so his first on screen jiu jitsu throw caught me off guard. I'd be curious to know if he did his own stunt work and martial moves depicted in the movie, as almost all were done in darkly shaded scenes.\n\nAs a Charlie Chan fan, I was curious about the Sultana Theater playbill advertising \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\" as one of it's attractions. That movie, released the prior year in 1938, featured Sidney Toler in his first portrayal of the Chinese detective. However the playbill mistakenly states that Chan is played by Warner Oland. It seems to me that the movie should have gotten this right, as 1938's \"Mr. Moto's Gamble\" was originally begun as \"Charlie Chan at Ringside\" with Oland. However Oland's illness and subsequent death required it's rewriting as a Moto film. This movie, released a year later, came after Oland's death in 1938.\n\n\"Mr. Moto's Last Warning\" was at least interesting enough to recommend looking up other titles in the series. I'll be looking forward to more adventures of the Japanese agent Kentaro Moto.",

                "text": "The Mr. Moto films went out of circulation immediately after Pearl Harbor. As we can see in this film, they reflected a hope that circulated in John P. Marquand's England (and had some currency in the US) that a reasonably 'civilized' (in the European sense) Japan could be negotiated with over China and then used for political leverage against Russia and Germany. This film was released in early 1939; by September of that year, Germany was in Poland, and England and France were allied against it, so the basic premise of the film was made worthless. Shortly after, the Japanese kicked the British out of China, so the basic hope underlying the film became worthless. The film is thus best approached as a kind of fantasy.\n\nIt is, specifically, a spy thriller, not a mystery at all; it's more closely related to the James Bond films (which are also largely fantasies) than to the Charlie Chan style 'oriental detective' movies of its own day.\n\nThis is the only widely - and cheaply - available Moto film. I've only seen one other Mr. Moto film, a long time ago, and I don't remember it well. It was a fairly faithful adaptation from the original Marquand material, and seemed very complicated, much as the Marquand novels can be. This film, to the contrary, is an original story. It is streamlined and linear in plotting. It appears to have been made rather quickly on not a lot of money, but the film-making is strictly professional. The pacing avoids a lot of lags, and there are moments of real suspense and real surprise.\n\nThus we have a well-made, enjoyable genre film here; but the main delight of the film is undoubtedly the performance of Peter Lorre. Lorre achieved some respect in Germany and England before coming to Hollywood - where, alas, he was not treated well, as the type for which he was usually cast - 'suspicious foreigner' - was very narrow. Mr. Moto here allows Lorre a star-turn, a hero's part, and surprisingly considerable latitude in interpretation. He is obviously having a grand time here, and delivers a wonderful performance.\n\nOverall, an excellent B-movie, very entertaining if taken on its own terms.",

                "text": "As originally created by author John P. Marquand, Moto was an icy and distinctly lethal Japanese agent; 20th Century Fox, which had earlier created the extremely popular Charlie Chan series, toned down his more deadly qualities, cast German actor Peter Lorre in the role, and between 1937 and 1939 made eight films featuring the character. Although they did not really challenge the Chan films, they were popular in their own right, and it was not until American sentiment began to turn against the Japanese that 20th Century Fox dropped the character.\n\nMade in 1939, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING is the sixth film in the series, and it finds Moto (Lorre) working to foil an attempt to set the English and French against each other by blowing up the French fleet as it enters an English-controlled canal in the middle east. Although the film has a slow start, it is graced with a gifted cast that includes George Sanders, John Carradine, and Ricardo Cortez, and it soon comes up a snappy pace and proves unexpectedly watchable.\n\nOver the years the Chan films have drawn considerable condemnation from Chinese Americans due to the fact that Chan was never played by an Asian actor; somewhat curiously, the Moto films have escaped the same degree of politically-correct derision. This is all the more odd because Lorre is even less of Japanse than Oland and Toler were Chinese. Even so, Lorre is always interesting to watch, and his unexpected physicality (Moto is a master of judo) drives the film remarkably well.\n\nMR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING is the only film in the series presently in public domain, a circumstance that seems more accidental than intentional. The Alpha release is very much in line with that: the picture is shaky, particularly in the opening segments, and the sound is quite weak. Fans of the series would do better to go with the series editions now in release through 20th Century Fox--but no matter which copy you lay hands on, you'll find the film an enjoyable bit of flyweight fun. Recommended to fans of 1930s mysteries, thrillers, and espionage movies.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Lorre not only plays Moto, but his cover, who runs an antique store.\n\nThe story concerns Moto's investigation of a conspiracy against the British and French governments. One of the \"conspirators\" is a British agent, and the two of them discover that the group has put mines in the harbor in order to blow up the French fleet -- the group had been desperately trying to find out the arrival date, and once they got it, set the bombs in place. Obviously, this is before Churchill blew the French fleet up in 1940 when the French refused to do so, which would thus give the Germans access to the fleet. The conspirators plan to blame the British for the bombing, hoping to start the Second World War.\n\nLorre does a great job, and Ricardo Cortez, as the head of the group whose works as a ventriloquist as his cover, makes an effective villain. Sanders uses a strange accent. Virginia Field, one of the \"ice cream blondes\" of that era was under contract to 20th Century Fox at the time; unfortunately, she never made it to the top, but she was in a lot of good films and is very pretty.

MOTO (1937), or at least hailed as one of the better products in the eight film series starring the one and only Peter Lorre in the title role. Based on the character \"Mr. Moto\" created by John P. Marquand, where the Kentaro Moto character is best described in the film as \"Nationality, Japanese. Age, 35-40. Short. Ju-jitsu expert. Uses various disguises. Adept at magic. Usually works alone. Has been known to use doubles,\" what really works here is the fine cast of supporting players, namely those familiar names Ricardo Cortez and George Sand, along with John Carradine and the lesser known Virginia Field making return engagements in the series, both assuming different character roles from earlier entries.\n\nOn the Valkin vessel bound for Port Said, an assortment of passengers are introduced: Madame Delacour (Margaret Irving) and her six-year-old daughter, Marie (Joan Carol); the French accented Eric Norvel (George Sanders); Rollo Van Debass (Robert Coote), a novelist and buffoon Englishman; and Mr. Moto (Teru Shimada) of the International Police. It is revealed that Norvel is being spied upon by the famed Japanese detective, with Captain Hawkins (Leyland Hodgson) secretly filling Norvel with details about Mr. Moto. After the boat docks, Moto encounters a Japanese man, the real Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) who passes him a Japanese written message to keep watching Norvel. After going through customs and into the streets, Norvel drives by and offers the fake Mr. Moto a ride to the Hotel Khedive, turning out to be Moto's final destination. With \"Mr. Moto\" out of the way, the real Mr. Moto must act as well as keeping his identity secret. As Moto keeps close tabs on Norvel, he also watches a ventriloquist act performed by Fabian the Great (Ricardo Cortez) and his prize dummy, Albert, the Sultana Theater Music Hall. Also in the audience is Danford (John Carradine), known only to Moto as Richard Burke, British Agent S-14, also on assignment to foil a dynamiting plot of the French fleet at the entrance of the Suez Canal that's to disrupt Franco-British diplomat relations. With Mr. Moto posing as Mr. Hykoroki, an shopkeeper at an antique shop of Oriental treasures located across the street from a pub called Connie's Place, owned by Connie Foster (Virginia Field), a woman with a shady past and Fabian's assistant of six years, Moto meets with some near death experiences along the way, but nothing as deadly as coming face to face with its dangerous ring leader.\n\nIn the tradition of the initial two entries, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING is simply 71 minute of fast-paced action and guessing. With the use of the Mr. Moto impersonator fails, the real Moto traditionally goes through measures of disguises, one as a juggler, another as a shopkeeper speaking in Japanese dialect. Near death experiences occur with one tense moment revolving around a ticking bomb hidden inside Moto's shop only moments before it's set to explode. Moto even does some underwater Tarzan-type diving and swimming as he attempts to rescue a victim thrown over and left to drown while tied inside a sack, and to foil a bombing attempt on the French fleet almost simultaneously. There's one moment of unpleasantness where one of the agents is left to die through suffocation while trapped underwater inside a diving bell with no method of escape. Among the villains, Ricardo Cortez comes off best as the most deadly, killing his victims with no remorse. His ventriloquist act is reminiscent to Erich Von Stroheim's performance in THE GREAT GABBO (1929) where he not only performs with his dummy, but converses and treats it as if he were human. Others featured in the cast include: E.E. Clive (The Port Commandant General); Holmes Herbert (Bentham); John Davidson (Hakim); and briefly, Bert Roach (The Hotel Clerk).\n\nFor being the first 1939 release, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING gives every indication of this being both a withheld release and one not released to theaters in the chronological order of production. Possibly produced and filmed late 1937 or early very 1938, aside from George Sanders' name listed fifth in the cast as opposed to third, and that Sanders, Peter Lorre, Virginia Field and Joan Carol having already appeared opposite Dolores Del Rio in LANCER SPY (1937), there's further evidence revealing its earlier production being out of date by 1939 standards during a movie house sequence with the marque reading, \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\" with Warner Oland. Due to Oland's passing in mid 1938, \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\" eventually did go into general release by year's end, but starring Sidney Toler as the new Chan.\n\nUnlike the other Moto entries, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING became the only one in the series to fall into public domain, and only one in the series readily available on video cassette from various distributors dating back to the 1980s. Two decades later, this and other Moto escapade, became available on DVD with some informative profiles about the series as part of the extras on individual discs. Television revivals for MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING during the cable and home video era of the 1980s were often broadcast on public or independent television stations through the 1990s before turning up on cable television, most currently on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered October 29, 2004.

The biggest problem I have with it is the pacing. Moto films usually have more life and energy to them. This one sort of drags in spots. I can't put all the blame on director Norman Foster as I don't necessarily think this is the best script he was given to work with. The script doesn't seem to have as much \"meat\" to it. I don't have any proof, but there is probably more padding in Mr. Moto's Last Warning than the other Moto films.\n\nStill, this is Moto so it's still going to be a fun movie. Lorre is as good as always. I've typed this a couple of times recently, but I don't think he ever gives a bad performance. Mr. Moto's Last Warning has one of the best supporting casts you'll find in one of these films - Geogre Sanders, Ricardo Cortex, John Carradine, Robert Coote, Virginia Field, and E.E. Clive. What a cast! The rest of the movie is great. Technically, as with all the Moto films, it looks like an A-movie.\n\nOne small thing that I've always enjoyed about Mr. Moto's Last Warning is the reference to the film Charlie Chan in Honolulu. I understand that this was done in part to pay tribute to Warner Oland who had recently passed away. Nice touch.",

Then too, when Chan is in a scene, he's always the center of attention. But not so with the recessive Moto. Note how he kind of lurks around the edges. Sometimes you even forget he's there. It's a really shrewd way to use the cagey Lorre since physically he's hardly a commanding presence. But he does convey a sly and calculating presence, such that when Moto chooses to pounce, he's very believable. It's a cleverly thought out character, a distinctive contrast to the many other sleuths of the period.\n\nOf course, Moto is not really a sleuth; instead, he's an agent of international intrigue. Sort of an unglamorous, non-gimmicky James Bond of the 1930's, skilled in what was then the exotic martial arts. The narrative contains no mystery, only the suspense of how Moto will foil an international plot to blow up French ships and start a war. What lifts this entry above standard series entries of the day are the production values. Notice the diving-bell sequence and how well done it is, both in detail and in concept. Cheaper productions could not have mounted this set-piece. Also, the sets are better furnished than normal, lending more atmosphere to the results. True, the action never leaves the back lot, but the attention to detail really helps. I also like the business going on in the background of the seedy saloon, where for example a drunk gets his nose plopped into a flagon of beer. It's colorful touches like this that raise a production above the routine.\n\nThere's also the eerie business with the ventriloquist's dummy. I kept wondering if someone connected with that great British horror trilogy Dead of Night (1945) had seen this programmer. My only reservations are with the sometimes hard-to-follow screenplay and with George Sanders' awful French accent. Odd too, to find the imposing Sanders in such a secondary role\u0097likely the result of being under contract. Anyway, it's a colorful little entry in the Moto series.",

The greatest interest in Mr. Moto's Last Warning lies in keeping track of how many deaths Mr. Moto will cause in the pursuit of his kind of justice. By my count it was a draw with the bad guys, with one ringer thrown in. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. \n\nWe're in Egypt and an unknown country is plotting to create an incident involving the Suez Canal that will have France and Britain at each other's throats. A master criminal and his gang, taking orders from this nameless country, will set mines at the entrance of the Canal. When the French fleet starts to pass though...kablooie! False evidence will point to Britain. However, Kentaro Moto of the International Police has been working to expose this plot for weeks. He knows the master criminal is in fact Fabian the Great (Ricardo Cortez), a smooth, quick-thinking and ruthless individual posing as a ventriloquist at a seedy Egyptian music hall. It would be hard to decide which is worse, Fabian's utter lack of scruple or George Sanders' awful German accent. (He plays Eric Novel, who tends to show up too often at places he shouldn't be.) Moto quickly finds he is alone. Every time he thinks he can call for assistance, death gets in the way. Finally, with only a foolish Englishman, played to perfection by Robert Coote, to help, Moto prevails and world peace is insured for a few more weeks. (The movie was made in 1939) \n\nPeter Lorre continues to do a fine job as Kentaro Moto. He gives Moto an interesting blend of innocence, shrewdness and ruthlessness. Ricardo Cortez, a great success as a leading man in the silent movies, was by now doing movies like this. He may be a stolid actor, but he still is interesting enough to carry the role without breaking a sweat. George Sanders, however, is just about as bad as his accent. My heart, however, was captured by Virginia Field as Connie, proprietor of Connie's Place, a seedy dive. Connie loves Fabian too much but at least she can tell the difference between right (smuggling) and wrong (blowing up the French fleet). Field plays Connie as a kind of dime-store version of Joan Blondell...blond, plump, good-hearted and luscious. \n\nFor those who also like to keep score, here's what I came up with. Caused by the bad guys: Death by knifing; death by diving bell. Caused by Kentaro Moto: Death by judo chop; death by too much Suez water. Caused by the ringer: Death by bullet into the chest.",

The story is a pretty good one but what really works here is the wonderful cast of character actors who really make this a must see. It's fun seeing Lorre's Moto up against various other actors who played famous roles themselves and that includes Perry Mason and Sam Spade (Cortez), The Saint (Sanders) and Dracula (Carradine) too. Seeing the four character actors share the same film makes for a lot of fun and the story itself also helps build some drama and that includes a wonderful underwater sequence that certainly won't be forgotten by anyone who sees it. The story is certainly a bit far fetched but it's made believable due to the actors all giving very good performances and Foster handles the material very well. The ending contains some great action with our hero kicking it into high gear to do major damage. The guys get to have a lot of fun but so does Virginia Fields in her small but fun role. Lorre is great as usual but it's actually Cortez who steals the film as the ruthless villain.

Plus, it's not hard to see that in ALL the fight scenes, Moto is NOT being played by Lorre but by a stuntman. Given that you can look past all this, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING isn't a bad B-movie detective film--nor is it exactly memorable either.\n\nMr. Moto is inexplicably investigating a plot to blow up French and English ships around the Suez Canal. This is inexplicable because back in 1939, the Japanese could have probably cared less about this AND because the country behind this plot (which, is NEVER mentioned in this film) must be Germany--and a Japanese detective is a very, very unlikely candidate to unearth this Nazi plot. Heck, I would have probably expected Moto to be the man behind this conspiracy! Despite these shortcomings, the film is pretty good. Ricardo Cortez was an excellent actor and was effective as the bad guy and the rest of the supporting actors, EXCEPT for George Sanders, were very good. Oddly, in Sanders' case, they had him playing someone with a heavy accent (I think it was supposed to be French, but at times it was tough to tell). Also, John Carradine played an English guy. He wasn't bad in the role, but I couldn't see why they didn't just give the English agent role to Sanders and let Carradine take a stab at Sanders' role. I think the highlight of the film for me was the diving bubble section, where Carradine is lowered onto the ocean floor by the bad guys. What a creepy scene.\n\nSo overall, the film had a decent number of flaws and was definitely far from being one of the better B-movie detective films. There are simply better series out there that are better--such as The Saint, Sherlock Holmes or Charlie Chan. A watchable time-passer and that's about all.",

Of course the difference between Sky Giant and Island in the Sky is the difference between RKO's back lot version of the Arctic and Warner Brothers in the early fifties shooting Island in the Sky on location.

A whole stream of good girl heroines. Both would break out of that mold in the forties roughly around the same time.\n\nSky Giant is a good product from a studio that mostly did B films of this nature.

However, she is blond and pretty and makes the most of it.\n\nLike her sister, she had to make do with the kind of role that supplied the romantic interest while the men (RICHARD DIX, CHESTER MORRIS) move the plot forward. And while they do move forward, it's still a rather plodding aviation story that had been done many times before with a bigger cast and budget.\n\nDix and Morris do well enough as the male buddies who antagonize each other with practical jokes (think Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy in TEST PILOT or Errol Flynn and Fred MacMurray in DIVE BOMBER). The flying scenes are fun to watch and provide a modicum of suspense, especially for the finale where their plane crash lands in the Arctic. The only other matter to be cleared up is whether Joan will end up with Dix or Morris as a suitable mate. For that, you have to watch the film.\n\nSister Olivia de Havilland was starring in the same sort of film the following year when she did WINGS OF THE NAVY at Warner Bros. with George Brent and John Payne as rivals for her affection. But in 1938, while Joan was playing this kind of starlet role at RKO, Olivia was already riding a horse in Sherwood Forest for what became one of her most famous roles opposite a charmer called Errol Flynn in a little gem called THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD.\n\nAs programmers go, SKY GIANT is above average in appeal, clearly a film made on a small budget but showing that Joan Fontaine was an ingenue who had promise.",

The men strike up a 1938-type friendship bond but fall in love with the same perky and fetching Meg (Joan Fontaine). The plot thickens when the two men and a third pilot from the school crash in the arctic during a mapping run for a new travel route. They say \"swell\" a lot and each man asks Meg to marry him after knowing her for only days (typical 1930's I suppose). A fun movie with a very pre-war feel and some great old airplanes and aerial footage. Lots of, \"awww Ken...ya know I love ya but don't go back into the air...\" kind of lines.

It's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but it's not at all like any of his better-known films. The offbeat premise leads you to expect a 1930s-style screwball comedy, but instead it has a different brand of humor altogether.\n\nThe tone of the film blends together the screwball plot idea with Hitchcock's dry sense of humor and the upbeat charm of Carole Lombard. It's something of an odd combination, but it works all right as long as you don't have too many preconceptions.\n\nLombard and Robert Montgomery work well as \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\", who find out at the beginning of the movie that they are not really married. Most of the story that follows moves at a decent pace, and although there are never any big laughs, there is some good material. It never really hits high gear, but once you get used to the pace, most of it works well enough.\n\nIt does slow down quite a bit towards the end, as things run out of steam, and this keeps the movie from being better. A grand climax in the screwball tradition might have made it a very good movie. Instead, as it is, \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" is a pleasant, generally amusing, slightly above-average romantic comedy.\n",

Everyone else, Gene Raymond as Jeff and Jack Carson as Chuck (he's especially hilarious; I wish he had had even more scenes!), and everyone else, too, is constantly hitting bullseyes.\n\nUnfortunately, in the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film, it begins to fall apart, after the plot moves to Lake Placid. First off, it's begins to grow tiresome. Lombard is starting to come off as unnecessarily cruel. The faux drunken mumblings of Montgomery aren't as funny as they're supposed to be.

Thank goodness for that! \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" is a rarity in that it was directed by that master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The film pays in ways that only a crafty Hitchcock would know how. The director takes Norman Krasna's screen play and gives it an elegant treatment.\n\nThe idea of a technicality annulling a marriage is at the center of the story. When David Smith is told about it, he sees the possibility of not telling his wife. Ann and David have a strange marriage life. They love each other dearly and they seem to work at maintaining their union as a fun enterprise where they are playful and do unexpected things to please one another. David miscalculates Ann's reaction to his playing a joke and not telling her about their new status.\n\nThe revelation at the beginning of the film is made known to Ann, who goes along with the joke expecting to be asked that same day to run to a justice of the peace to get married again. When David doesn't act on what for Ann seems to be essential, she flies into a rage and vows to get even with David. This is the basic premise of the comedy. Things get complicated, but we know all will be right at the end as Ann will come to her senses. David also is expected to legalize their status.\n\nThe film is a joy to watch because of the two stars. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery were two charismatic performers that had an uncanny sense of timing. They make a delicious couple that deserve to be happy, even at the expense of making each other crazy in the process. Just to see a playful Carole Lombard giving a razor shave to Robert Montgomery is well worth the prize of admission!\n\nThe rest of the cast is outstanding. Gene Raymond plays David's partner, Jefferson Custer, an upright man who admires Ann from a distance. Their scene when they get stuck in the rain at Coney Island's parachute, has to be one of the highlights of the movie. That whole sequence after they return to Jeff's apartment and he gets the \"liquor\" medicine from Ann is hilarious.\n\nThere is a cameo from the director that passes by too quickly and if the viewer is not paying attention, it will be missed. Jack Carson is excellent as the bad influence for David. Philip Mervale and Lucile Watson are seen as Jeff's parents.\n\nThis film proves Alfred Hitchcock could have tried his hand at more comedies because he seems to be a natural to the genre.

                "text": "Because it is somewhat unique in Hitchcock's works, there has been a continuous attempt in recent years to upgrade public opinion about MR. AND MRS. SMITH. Hitchcock explained to Francois Truffault in HITCHCOCK/TRUFFAULT that he always wanted to work with Carole Lombard, and she prevailed on him to do this film with her. But that does not really explain the choice of material.\n\nLombard, of course, is best recalled for her wonderful daffiness in screwball comedies like NOTHING SACRED, TRUE CONFESSIONS, and MY MAN GODFREY. Her co-star, Robert Montgomery, had been in many delightful comedies (PETTICOAT FEVER, PICADILLY JIM) too. But both performers had been in dramatic films. In this period Montgomery (fresh from his great performance as Danny in NIGHT MUST FALL) had made RAGE IN HEAVEN with Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders, and Lombard did VIGIL IN THE NIGHT with Brian Ahearn. They were both highly capable of dramatic performances.\n\nSo why couldn't they have sought a more typical Hitchcock screenplay? My suspicion is that Hitchcock chose to make a \"screwball comedy\" as an experiment. He did that frequently when he felt like stretching his abilities, and sometimes the results were not too good. When it was a technical experiment like ROPE or DIAL \"M\" FOR MURDER he still had the strength of the film script to fall back on if his nine minute shots or his use of three dimensional film did not quite work wonders with the audience. But when he tried humor, he had less success.\n\nHitch's sense of humor is not bad - but it works best when he uses it sparingly. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956), Hitch sets up a delayed joke involving Hillary Brooke and another actor coming to visit their friends Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day in London. Stewart and Day leave their flat because they are going to try to rescue their son (in the hands of the kidnappers). They apologize and tell Brooke and her husband they'll be back presently with their son. Brooke and her husband look confused as they leave. The remainder of the film, and the melodrama in the embassy is played out. Final scene shows Brooke and her husband have fallen asleep waiting for them. Day, Stewart and their son come in, wake up Brooke and her husband, and proceed to act as though nothing has happened for three or four hours.\n\nThat is an example of when the Hitchcock humor works. But then comes his full scale \"black comedy\" THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, and the viewer has mixed feelings. Individual moments work, like the manipulation of the dull sheriff Royal Dano. But one finds most of the humor about moving a dead body fairly unimaginative...surprisingly so from Hitch.\n\nMR. AND MRS. SMITH is not a black comedy, but it's type of bedroom farce situation would have been better handled by Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey or Preston Sturgis. The joke is that the surface-warring Smiths are really in love, but discover that their marriage was illegal. Montgomery had said he'd marry Lombard again if he had to (prior to the discovery of the illegal marriage), but instead of rushing Lombard off to any nearby church or justice of the peace he hesitates. And Lombard wonders what kind of man she has been illegally married to. So she turns to his partner Gene Raymond, who is interested in her.\n\nThere are some interesting moments in the film (Hitchcock has to be of interest always). The scene where Montgomery pretends to be talking to the pretty woman sitting next to him (incurring the ire of her date) is good, culminating in Jack Carson trying to stop a bleeding nose on Montgomery by using a \"cold\" knife as a cauterizing instrument. There is also a funny moment when Lombard and Raymond, on a trip to an amusement park, get stuck on a ferris wheel on top of it during a heavy thunder storm. But these moments are far and few. As a romantic comedy it is mediocre, despite it's stars and (unfortunately) because of it's director. Hitchcock must have realized it too - until THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY he never attempted a straight comedy again, and (as mentioned before) THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was not a romantic comedy but a \"black comedy\".",

It's an OK comedy but did anyone else notice how annoying Carole Lombard's character is? Even the people around her are a bit offbeat. She is so annoying shrill and dreary one wonders why Robert Montgomery is working so hard to get her back. Alright for your Hitch collection but not really a fantastic film. It's a look back into the social mores of yesterday as Montgomery exposes Carole as a married woman so the store she's employed at fires her as it's the store's policy not to employ married women. One wishes the characters could have been played a little more warmly instead of the tart,sharp way they were directed by Hitchcock. Since he wasn't crazy about the project,he might have injected a bit more cynicism than he thought.",

                "text": "There seems to be little consensus on this movie; most people love it or hate it. I can see why. The movie has its golden gleaming moments, and then it has its moments that fall flat with a hollow thud. Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is the hollowest thud of all, and smacks almost of soap opera.\n\nAlso, Lombard hardly seems herself in this movie; she plays the foil to Montgomery's gleefully devilish protagonist, and only occasionally does she steal a scene. Hitchcock (or perhaps the screenplay) seems almost determined to keep her locked down. A pity.\n\nStill, Montgomery's leering eyes and wicked yet boyish half-smile are by themselves reason enough to watch this movie. The whole issue of forbidden, illicit sex is handled beautifully, because, after all, the two are man and wife in everything but legal technicality. It seems odd that Lombard's character reacts with such savage anger about the whole thing. Considering the way she plays fast and loose with the affections of her husband's partner, even though she can't deny that she has been a common law wife of three years standing, one wouldn't expect such a prudish attitude from her. More likely, she would have joined her erstwhile husband in enjoying the hint of illicit passion. But it's best, in movies like this, not to examine the logic behind the story too closely.\n\nAlthough Montgomery is the heart of the movie, nevertheless, perhaps the best scene in the movie is when the strait-laced genteel Gene Raymond proceeds from tipsy directly to dead-drunk and delivers possibly the funniest (because the most realistic) rendering of inebriation ever filmed. There's a point where he plants a foot on a step in front of him, a very low step, and one would think that in so doing he had just climbed Mount Everest. Priceless.\n\nOthers have noted, and I agree, that outside of Lombard, Montgomery and Raymond, the other characters are mere cardboard props and simply not funny. One can see that Hitchcock himself recognized this. When Raymond is closeted with his concerned parents in the bathroom at his office, the director is reduced to using gurgling plumbing sounds to punctuate the dialog--and for no apparent reason other than for some kind of comedic effect, because the dialog so clearly lacks any. When plumbing steals the show, you know you're in trouble.\n\nOne might see, in the trip to the rustic resort, an echo of Shakespeare's comedies, in which the scene always changed from the banal to the fantastical to underscore or even effect the transformation of the characters. But that doesn't happen here. Everyone continues to act the way they did before. That's not surprising, for in Shakespeare, the change in scene always happened at the beginning, not the end. You can't teach an old dog new tricks, and the personalities of the characters are engraved in marble by this point.\n\nThese scenes mark the final transition of a movie that was already verging on stage-bound into more or less just another play on celluloid. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does little to revive the movie's already fainting comedic momentum. It attempts the usual farce, door-slamming, rushing to-and-fro, characters affecting dramatic poses, but it doesn't really work, and that devilish grin of Montgomery's seems long, long in the past. He becomes a cipher for the last part of the movie, Raymond's character was a cipher to begin with, and that leaves only Lombard, whose character was hemmed into a cage of shrewishness by the script (or the director) from the very beginning. The ending, therefore, is arbitrary and unsatisfying, and worst of all, not the least bit funny. The movie turns too late to pratfall comedy, and the image of Lombard tangled in skis simply doesn't work. She's been far too efficient and capable until now to be believable as the hapless, helpless, love-lorn buffoon.\n\nNevertheless, the movie was well worth watching. I'll never forget those gleaming eyes and that almost forward-leaning stride of Montgomery, as if he just couldn't wait to barrel into the next scene. One is almost tempted to forgive him his chumminess with the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nAlmost.",

                "text": "First: a warning.\n\nI recently saw this movie on DVD in the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection' series. The source print looks to be in immaculate condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video. The framing is far too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cropped. I gather from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version available.\n\nMr and Mrs Smith is just a footnote to Hitchcock's career.\n\nIn his lengthy interviews with Francois Truffaut in the Sixties, Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work, but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to Carole Lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed Norman Krasna's screenplay.\n\nIn truth, there is not much more that needs to be said.\n\nIt is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as It Happened One Night, His Girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being 'adorably' unreasonable.\n\nRobert Montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband, but it is hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the movie the audience is saying: \"dump the silly cow, she's not worth it.\"\n\nGene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged. He is supposed to be a courtly, 'old family' Southerner, although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene (which he otherwise plays very well). He is an honourable, generous, teetotal gentleman, so of course he is bullied and patronised by Robert Montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes - although he is not as badly treated as the similar Ralph Bellamy character in His Girl Friday.\n\nThis movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation, but hadn't actually seen one. For example, a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on-going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap. Here, all the comedy elements are just strung out, like beads on a necklace. This is screwball comedy by the numbers.\n\nIt is the same with the direction. Typically, these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end. Hitchcock doesn't get this. His direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over-written (but under-nourished) and slightly too long. He was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it. They do OK.\n\nHitchcock had a good sense of humour, which he frequently used in his thrillers, but he had no feel for comedy as a genre. His later Trouble with Harry was also a misfire, for similar reasons to this movie, but at least he was involved in that picture. Here he is just going through the motions.\n\nAll the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad. It just feels a bit derivative, over-familiar, over-long and ultimately rather flat.\n\nMr and Mrs Smith is one for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock completists only.",

                "text": "The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character is, as another user put it, \"unnecessarily cruel\". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling Robert Montgomery. The movie has some funny moments, especially when Montgomery's character goes to great lengths to try to get his \"wife\" back. Understandably, she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal, but she only finds out three years into it.\n\nLombard's character seems quite cold to her \"husband's\" sincere attempts to woo her back. While not being highly adept in that effort, Montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving, and yet Lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice. There are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie, and it is hard to see any sort of comedy- even dark comedy- in that aspect. To some extent, the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone, with Lombard's character getting a \"kick\" out of her husband's feeble efforts. While one might consider this another 'Battle of the Sexes' type of movie, the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle, if that: Montgomery's character, while certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist/misogynist (an excellent example of that is Michael Douglas in 'War of the Roses'). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed by not only the sharp dress of Montgomery (which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort in attempting-but failing- to play the role of a womanizing bachelor. His only major flaw is his vanity, but that fault does not balance out with his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love. This is what makes it so cruel, and sad. Montgomery's character simply looks weak. In reality, no wife would want a man so weak unless she \"wears the pants\" in the marriage. But then again, a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on. Hence, the whole theme seems weird. This movie is neither a champion of feminism (Lombard's character does show some signs of the sort of independent-oriented woman of the 60s, but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s), nor an even-sided battle of the sexes (as Montgomery's character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause).\n\nThis movie is, on the surface, a slapstick, but beneath that veneer it is really much darker, with sadistic undertones. All of which makes its resolution appear, well, odd. (Maybe that oddity was the whole point?). In any case, slapstick this movie is not.",

Almost all of his films contain humour and some (like The Trouble With Harry) are overtly comic, but they all retain macabre or thriller elements. This on the other hand is in the classic style of the time - you can almost see Hepburn and Tracy in the roles - and as such it seems a little contrived in Hitchcock's hands. It's a lot of fun though, with good dialogue, and fine performances from all three leads; Montgomery (the father of Bewitched TV star Elizabeth) is agreeably resigned to his life's complications, Lombard is terrific as always as the needy, sulky, over-analysing shrew, and Raymond is wonderfully patient and strait-laced as the third point of an extremely grating love triangle. There are plenty of funny moments to keep it going, like the dialogue about the cat or the scene in the bathroom with the noisy plumbing, but it doesn't have the tension or objective sweep we are accustomed to with Hitch's films.

His reply of 'Honestly, no' is not what she had been expecting. Coincedentally, on the same day David and Ann discover that, due to a technical glitch, they aren't really married after all. Like all, screwball set-ups, havoc quickly ensues.\n\nThe problem with Mr and Mrs Smith is that too many jokes simply fall flat on their face. The film does not have enough gags that truly work, with only a few moments that gain a genuine smile. Also, Lombard's character is also portrayed at many times as being unnecessarily cruel.

There a few good scenes, and probably the funniest is when Montgomery tries to make Lombard jealous in a restaurant.\n\nIt's remarkable that this is a Hitchcock film- it feels so American in style.

He manhandles Ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. Ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what he did in Paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet. \"I forgave you that!\" she says, as if it was big of her.\n\nFor David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his \"mistress\" before tying the knot for good.

Hitchcock claimed he made the film as a favor to lead actress Carole Lombard; Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the only screwball comedy the famous suspense director ever made. Starring along with Carole Lombard is Robert Montgomery; the pair plays a married couple who find out that their marriage is unofficial, and instead of going through the legal paperwork to make their union legal, they question each other and their feelings. Out of his element, Hitchcock put forth a classic comedy that oddly still feels like a Hitchcock film, a true treat for the serious fan as they wade through Hitch's body of work. \n\nElite New York couple Ann Smith (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) have enjoyed an affectionate, loving, wedded bliss for three years. After individual visits from their lawyers, however, they learn that a municipal technicality prevented their union from being legally recognized. What should be a simple fix, turns into a possible breakup for the couple as they start to wonder how much in love with each other they truly are. The day the couple was told of the technicality, David commented over breakfast that if he were to start his life over, he would never marry. Despite his love for his wife, David feels as though an immense amount of sacrifice of himself has taken place due to his marriage to his wife. That comment has stuck with Ann as she decides what to do about her defunct marriage to her husband. Ann decides that a separation is in order and she begins to live the life of a single woman, even re-adopting her maiden name. As Ann enjoys her new life and freedoms, David sets his sights to stop at nothing to win back the devotion of his wife. Winning back Ann's hand becomes much more difficult as she begins dating other men. As David becomes increasingly more disgruntled with life without his wife, he begins to realize that maybe he wouldn't remove his wife from his life if he had the chance to do it again.\n\nAs a fan of classic cinema, I was both surprised and embarrassed to realize that this was the first film I had seen of classic star Carole Lombard. I was happy to change that status and finally see her of a film; I found Lombard's acting exceptional and engaging, and cannot wait to see more of her work. This film is a lot of fun with the slight nods to silent cinema it seems to employ. The ways in which Mr. & Mrs. Smith plays out like a silent film, prove to be a perfect match to the plot of men's and women's relationships of the 1940's. As Lombard gains independence, she enjoys life without her husband more, therefore illustrating the liberation of women in the 40's. Although Mr. & Mrs. Smith has a very Howard Hawks feel to it, it is also clear that there are many aspects recognizable as Hitchcock touches. For instance, this journey through Alfred Hitchcock's filmography, I have grown quite fond of the way in which the auteur films faces. That same unique way faces are filmed are present in this film and are fun to watch. Sure, the film is a comedy, therefore Hitchcock touches are few and far between, but the film doesn't feel foreign to fans of Hitchcock and one can see his touches in it throughout the film. Fans of Hitchcock must see this film, if for no other reason, just to see the famous suspense director trying his hand at comedy; although, if given a chance, one won't be disappointed with a Carole Lombard film, either.",

Seeing Hitchcock's name as director in the opening credits also added to my quandary. Not known for comedy in general, Hitch would often use humor and light touches in his dramatic films, but even that seemed to be absent here. The picture just didn't work for me. Maybe if Cary Grant had the lead here opposite someone like Ann Sheridan or Rosalind Russell (See \"His Girl Friday\"), they might have pulled it off. The film needed a lot more energy than what was provided by the principals here.\n\nThe main problem I guess I have is with Carole Lombard's character, Annie Krausheimer Smith. In the early going she managed to bother me with her clingy attachment to husband David (Robert Montgomery), but then when the story's reveal occurred about their 'non-marriage', she went totally in the opposite direction. Had the couple any sort of chemistry to begin with they might have made the situation work to comedic effect, but the whole time I was waiting for it, the humor never materialized.\n\nI did have one sit up and take notice moment though. How about that scene where Jeff Custer's (Gene Raymond) father called Annie 'white trash'! Wow, was that the first time the term was ever used in a movie? I had that term pegged as a more recent colloquialism and here it turns out to be at least seventy five years old! \n\nWell I'm generally in the minority on most of Hitchcock's directorial efforts. Notwithstanding the man's reputation as one of the best, I usually encounter something that just doesn't click with me in a lot of his pictures. On that score, most everything didn't click with me here, and I'm tempted to say that there's probably more humor in the 2007 movie of the same name starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. And in that one, they're a pair of assassins!",

For me, the storyline was a little too talky, especially several later extended scenes that appear to grant actor Raymond's character more screen time. What's needed, I think, is more spark, the kind provided by Jack Carson's steam room Lothario or the lively nightclub scene that's a real hoot. Otherwise, Lombard shows her comedic skills in a rather difficult role, while Montgomery mugs it up in unMontgomery fashion. However, pity poor Gene Raymond who's stuck with a boring role that appears out of sync for a comedy with the exception of his one well-done drunk scene. Overall, this sophisticated farce is a little too smooth and polished to really impress. And, despite scripter Krasna's many crafty innuendos, likely over-written, as well. Nonetheless, many amusing moments do remain. It's just not front-rank or what we might expect from an all-time great like Hitchcock. Rather, Hitch excelled at amusing moments, but as this effort shows, comedy as a format was not his world-class strength.",

                "text": "Sandwiched between two more typical Hitchcock directorial offerings (\"Foreign Correspondent\" and \"Suspicion\"), 1941's \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" is a screwball comedy based upon an unlikely premise and teased to the limits of credulity and beyond. So far beyond that the screwball formula fails and the film falls flat. Though it is tempting to hypothesize that romantic comedies were so far out of Hitchcock's wheelhouse that his direction failed, the blame should be given to the screenplay.\n\nIt is said that Hitchcock strayed so far afield because he wanted to work with Carole Lombard (Ann Smith). And that he directed the film as written because he recognized his limitations in the genre. He certainly had a (dark and mischievous) sense of humor and the story could have used more of his sensibilities. One has to wonder if wartime concerns for his homeland left him distracted or somewhat alienated from comedy.\n\nThe film starts with the happy title couple enjoying one of their tiffs with playful give and take and humorous teasing. David Smith (Robert Montgomery) is later notified that their marriage is not technically legal. Viewing it as comical, he plans to inform his wife later, but she learns of the technicality first. Initially she downplays the news, but her humor quickly turns to suspicion and then anger. And this is where the film turns from comedy to comedy failure. From that moment on, her actions are that of a woman bent on revenge, with no intentions of continuing her marriage. Within twenty-four hours, she goes out with another man and makes no attempts to reconcile.\n\nThis is not to say that there are no humorous elements in the remainder of the film. It's just that are undercut by the film's prevailing dark tone.\n\nThe film is firmly rooted in the mores of its time, which is something of an annoyance for modern viewers. Concern over \"What will the neighbors say?\" is a common theme in many films, but here it feels inflated to an unnecessary level, especially since there is no reason to believe any \"neighbor\" would ever be aware of the glitch.\n\nThis could have been a marvelous film, considering the talents of Lombard and Montgomery. One can imagine an alternative script that would have been lighter in tone, with both character's actions escalating to limits of silliness. Then Lombard's fire would have been channeled into a comedic battle of wits and wills. And Montgomery would have been less a victim and more a combatant.",

                "text": "\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" is a good comedy about a couple who learn that they haven't been legally married the past three years as they thought they were. The \"un-marriage\" is based on an absurd notion, but it sets the stage for what follows. And what follows is a comedy of errors and airs in which the groom pursues his bride all over again, while she plays hard to get.\n\nRobert Montgomery and Carole Lombard are the leads as David and Ann Smith. She reverts to her maiden name, Ann Krausheimer when they split up. This isn't one of Carole Lombard's funnier roles, but Montgomery is funny as he jumps through hoops to try to win his wife back. His law firm partner, Jeff Custer, also wants to woo Ann. Gene Raymond plays his part superbly as a real male wallflower. He's straight faced, overly considerate, and straightforward about a relationship with the one-time wife of his best friend and partner. It makes it that much funnier \u0096 and frustrating for David.\n\nSome of the funniest scenes are with Jeff's parents. Lucille Watson plays Mrs. Custer, Jeff's mother. She was one of the consummate Hollywood supporting cast who played superbly the role of a shocked mother, or mother-in-law, or snobbish, Puritanical society dame. Philip Merivale is equally aghast as Jeff's father, Ashley Custer. An uproarious scene occurs when Jeff introduces them to Ann. Just as they think she is a sweet, young thing, David enters the office and talks about their coffee together over the morning breakfast table the past three years. The crunch comes when he asks about his laundry, and says he doesn't have any more clean shorts. A type of this scene replays toward the end of the film \u0096 with hilarious portrayals of the dumbfounded and astonished Custers.\n\nIt's a good thing that David and Jeff owned their own law firm. No one else would have been able to take so much time away from work as David did to pursue Ann. Some reviewers are surprised that this film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitch was well established as a versatile director before he came to the U.S. just before the start of World War II. He became known for his mastery at mystery films. But he had done a number of comedies, romances and dramas before, and even did one successful musical drama.\n\nThis film came out at the end of January 1941. A year later Carole Lombard would be dead. She was killed in a plane crash in Nevada while returning home to California from a war bond drive. She was only 34 years old, but she is remembered today from some of the wonderful films she was in, especially her comedy roles. She was in 80 films in a 16-year career.\n\nOn the other hand, Robert Montgomery isn't as well known today. He played a variety of roles in more than 60 films, but ended his silver screen career at age 46 in 1950. He spent the rest of his career in television. His last acting was in 1950-51 in his long-running TV series, Robert Montgomery Presents. After that, he continued to produce that show until 1957 and did some more TV production until 1960. He continued to work in the theater in the 1950s and won the 1955 Tony Award as best director for \"The Desperate Hours.\" In 1968, Montgomery wrote a book entitled \"An Open Letter from a Television Viewer\" in which he lambasted the TV industry for its programming of violence.\n\nA favorite scene of mine in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" has Jeff and Ann riding in a sleigh to the cottages they have booked at Lake Placid in the Adirondacks. Ann says, \"I love the smell of snow.\" Jeff says, \"No one can smell snow.\" And Ann responds, \"I can.\" Jeff looks around as though he's sniffing, then looks down at the horses pulling the sleigh and says, \"That isn't snow.\"",

I went Googling and sure enough, the scar was the result of an auto accident when Lombard was 19.

By the end of the film, instead of being charmed and entertained by their antics, the two main characters have become very, very annoying.

                "text": "This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the \"screwball\" pictures of the 1930s.\n\nHitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text, forced to turn his technique to heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch.\n\nFirst, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous \u0096 the \"ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have?\" situation, and he was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light, tender touch is required and Hitch doesn't have it.\n\nSecondly, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock films could be funny \u0096 The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example \u0096 but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller \u0096 snappy opposing angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots \u0096 but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point, and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy \u0096 for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table \u0096 but such moments are few and far between.\n\nEven the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength lay, and he is boring here. This was of course exactly where \"Queen of Screwball\" Carole Lombard's strength lay, and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera, fails to perk things up at all. Of course, neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay, which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place, even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.\n\nThe only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry, and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness. However it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour, when the basic framework was suspense \u0096 as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot \u0096 that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.",

The script is elegant and witty, with razor-sharp interplay between the leads and many moments that will make you smile or laugh out loud(if it's not your cup of tea at the day, it's not a problem, Hitchcock's few ventures into comedy have all brought divisive opinions). It is a shame though that it is also one of those scripts that runs out of steam too early. There are also some great scenes that carry the slightly flimsy premise afloat, Robert Montgomery has the best moments, though Gene Raymond's tipsy to drunk scene is a joy and the razor shave moment is a nice example of the chemistry between the two leads. The two leads are wonderful and are thoroughly convincing together. Carole Lombard relishes her very showy role with great comic timing, not the most pleasant of characters mind you especially towards the end of the film, and looks radiant on screen. Robert Montgomery is much more subtle(no offence at all to Lombard) and has a more likable character, his comic timing is also spot on. The supporting roles are all solid, with Jack Carson and especially Gene Raymond the standouts.

The dizzy daffy dopey blonde of the superb 'My Man Godrey' in 1936 has finally grown up and stopped throwing temper tantrums. As a result, she's now, at last, fabulous.

It's not that they want to become comedians, but that they need to be able to add a comic touch to serious roles when appropriate.\n\nI think Hitch made Mr. and Mrs. Smith for the same reason: to master comic timing and nuance, so he could apply to other films. We see a wide palette of comedy in this movie, from subtle to slapstick. And I think Hitch demonstrated an understanding of how to move an audience to laughter without becoming hammy.\n\nThe problem is mainly in he script. It is difficult to keep this premise going for 95 minutes. The 1952 Fred Allen movie We're Not Married took 86 minutes to apply the same premise to five couples.\n\nThis would have been a pleasant enough flick to watch on a Saturday afternoon in the days before DVDs, VHS, or even TV. Studios needed to crank them out, and this would have been a satisfactory product. And remember, Alfred Hitchcock was not the household name in America he was to become.\n\nI think people here are being way too hard on Hitch. A good director doesn't want to always be making the same movie, even if audiences do. I think Hitch succeeded in what he set out to do. And then he moved on to make the classy movies he is famous for today.\n\nWhat made the Hitch thrillers distinctive was their precisely nuanced wry humor even in the most dramatic scenes, like Cary Grant driving drunk as a skunk down the hill to Glen Cove in North by Northwest. Hitch's style sparked a whole crime caper genre from other directors that included Charade, Gambit, Mirage and Goldfinger.\n\nAnd it all started with an exercise in comedy called Mr. and Mrs. Smith.",

                "text": "This screwball comedy has a naughty little premise behind it. A man discovers he isn't legally married and decides not to tell his wife. He'd rather be with her as if she were his mistress and have sex without the benefit of marriage. He finds the idea to be thrilling and exciting. Why he does isn't addressed. Perhaps the idea of defying society's conventions, or maybe the idea of gaining more power over his wife; a man can easily dump a mistress at any time; a wife, there's a long, messy divorce to deal with. Also, there's the sexual element behind it too; presumably sex with a mistress is more thrilling than sex with a wife.\n\nThe wife finds out and dumps the husband for trying to turn her into that kind of woman. She dates his law partner, a true Southern gentleman who's entirely prim and proper and would never think of touching a woman before marriage. In the end, the wife finds their relationship unfulfilling, especially when he does not resort to violence to protect her honor. She dumps him and turns back to her hubby, a \"real man.\" It's interesting that the movie ends with the husband getting exactly what he wants, sex with his wife before marriage. In effect, despite his wife's long protest, he wins; he now takes her as his mistress. This is a sex comedy where the man entirely gets his way; his sex dream is realized.\n\nQuestions this film asks: does one really have to wait for marriage to have sex? Is it better to have a wife or a mistress? The film also offers insight into the different social standards of the higher and lower class, especially in the scene at the upscale nightclub where Montgomery is embarrassed to be with low-brow Jack Carson and the two low-brow dames Carson brings with him.\n\nOverall, the cast is good, though the three principles all show signs of premature aging. It's interesting to watch movies of the early 40s and see what's become of stars from the late 20s and early 30s. Some are still stars, like Montgomery and Lombard. Others are fading to character status like Gene Raymond. He's almost unrecognizable in dyed black hair as the type of character Ralph Bellamy plays so well in films like \"The Awful Truth\" and \"His Girl Friday\"; it's a far cry from Raymond's leading man days of the early 1930s. Saddest of all is to see what happened to another leading lady of the late 20s, Betty Compson. A star from the great 1928 film \"The Docks of New York,\" she's truly unrecognizable here as the beat-up, low-class hag Gertie.\n\nNorman Krasna's script is serviceable, with a number of truly funny lines and scenes, mostly avoiding the sort of clich\u00e9-riddled, unfunny, idiotic cuteness that makes the 1943 film \"Princess O'Rourke\" so intolerable, a film for which Krasna inexplicably won the Academy Award for best screenplay. The first half of the film is the best half, before the focus shifts to Lombard and the boring Raymond. Hitchcock is serviceable too, though anyone could have directed this film. Obviously, Hitch didn't have the gift of an Ernst Lubitsch when it came to sex comedies. Neither did anyone else, and at least Hitch here makes no pretense as to having the \"Lubitsch touch,\" unlike Billy Wilder, who failed numerous times in trying to recreate it, in movies like \"Sabrina\"(1954). \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" does deal with some domestic themes that Hitch is particularly fond of though, namely the battle of the sexes and the husband getting his way in the end.",

Hitchcocks most notorious and memorable comedic scenes are those which appear in his most tense and thrilling films, working best because of the dark and sexually charged situations his characters find themselves in. In Mr and Mrs Smith Hitchcock spends the entire film dissecting the flaws and perks of married life- becoming overly accustomed to one another, yet knowing that no-one else could put up with them.\n\nAfter playing their usual, monthly truth telling game in which husband and wife ask each other a question which the other must answer truthfully, a game which will naturally lead to problems, Annie becomes annoyed with her husband David. She asks if he had to do it all over again, would he still have married her. He answers know as he misses his freedom, but says he does not regret anything he has done, and loves her. In an odd coincidence both David and Annie hear that their marriage is void and they simply must remarry. However, both decide to play with the rule unknown to the other, and soon all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe two leads are good, and the best moments, aside from the dialogue, are Hitchock deliberately showing the monotony of both married life, and the singles game, and the last few scenes in the log cabins involving husband and wife trying to make each other guilty. Unfortunately this is too soft, and does not have enough funny parts to deserve many watches, but is an interesting film nonetheless as it is a change of pace from what we would expect.\n\n6 out of 10",

His sense is rather subtle, expressed through ironical situations built up to give a light background to the main story. Screwball comedy is a whole genre where the comic situations make the plot go forward.\n\nThat's why here the Hitchcock humor works way better than the screwball comic simply because that's what he knows best. As a screwball comedy it lacks rhythm, a major problem all the good acting in the world will never make up for. Hitch fails to unleash his directing out of the serious concern about married life and the storyline constantly hesitates between the stiff Robert Montgomery and the whimsical Carole Lombard. Thus the best things come along the way: visual ideas to depict this weird couple in the beginning and a couple of good gags afterwards.\n\nThe best gag is certainly that one, halfway through the movie, at the the Florida Club -- not too dissimilar to the unknitting pullover gag in the beginning of The 1934 Man who Knew too Much -- where Mr Smith tries to make his 'illegal' wife jealous. The last 30 minutes are emblematic of the major failure. Out of the blank the set moves to Lake Placid where it lags till one last good but classical scene, making the reuniting of the couple merely incidental in the course of the movie while it should have been a climax.\n\nHence Mr & Mrs Smith is not a great Hitchcock which shows us the sense of humor is rather different than the sense of comedy.

                "text": "\nThis is an early U.S. directorial effort by Alfred Hitchcock, but don't look for spine chilling suspense here.  Instead, look for a surprisingly deft comedy, a sophisticated comedy of the same genre as THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, released about the same year.\n\nThe plot goes something like this; Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Robert Montgomery and Carol Lombard) are this evidently well to do couple (he's a lawyer who apparently can take days away from the office to resolve marital battles), who live on Park Avenue.  They have no children, and I bring this up only to say that the presence of kids would wreck the feel of the movie.  Well, all is well with the Smiths, who have always held that when a fight has erupted in the bedroom, neither can leave the bedroom until their dispute has been resolved and they are in each other's arms again.  Trouble comes in the form of an agent from the state where they were married, someplace like Colorado, who has the unpleasant task of notify some folks, the Smith's among them, that their marriages are not legal due to some mish-mash about county and state lines, etc.  The stage is now set, do either want to get married again?\n\nThe situations that face the Smith's are so funny and droll, that I find myself giggling at them, even after many viewings.  For example,  Robert Montgomery takes Carol Lombard to the old bistro that they used to go to when they were dating.  She has all kinds of expectations that he'll take this opportunity to re-pop the question.  She jams herself into the same chic suit she wore on her wedding day, only to find out that the few pounds she had put over the years causes her skirt to split at the seams, solved by carefully placed safety pins tucked from view.  When they get to the old neighborhood, they find that the trendy bistro they used to frequent has fallen on evil days, the whole neighborhood has, in fact, turned into a sort of slum.  They walk into the establishment...... a solitary man sitting at the counter with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth hails the cook by yelling \"customers!\"  The place has a cat hanging around begging for food. They ask to move the table out to the sidewalk as in the old days, and they are accommodated but only to have homeless children stand by staring at them with hunger and want.\n\nThe match-up of Montgomery and Lombard works well.  He is at his best as the sleek, well groomed, Park Avenue type.  He had plenty of practice at these types of roles going back to PRIVATE LIVES.  Carol Lombard is glamorous, high-strung, and hot tempered.  A good supporting cast including Gene Raymond and a young Jack Carson are on hand.\n\nThis is a delightful movie, and I wonder when watching it how nice it would be to be free of any money cares, and be able to spend my time involved in madcap romantic schemes.  There's a lot of fun to be had during this show.\n",

His humor is usually distinctly black but always essential and associated with the context of the story. However, one of Hitchcock's most hated pictures \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" is an exception in this, as comedy isn't a mere subtext, for the film is style-wise a pure screwball comedy. In the hands of any other director, the story would have gathered warm romantic tone but in Hitchcock's grip it reveals its cynic nature. This is partially due to Hitchcock's moral honesty. His uncompromising reluctance to embellish cruelty. \n\nHitchcock is always celebrated as \"the master of suspense\" and as the great teller of crime stories. But the crimes committed in \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" are of different nature. For they are precisely crimes of passion because they are aimed at pride, dignity and, in the worst case, love. In the 1960's, Hitchcock told Truffaut that he only made the film as a favor to Carole Lombard. In his own words, he only filmed what was said in the screenplay. In reality, however, the film has a lot of characteristic elements of Hitchcock's distinct style, wit and world view. The first scene, for example, is a brilliant expression of personal anguish in dysfunctional married life, introducing the film's satirical nature.\n\nAlthough the film is a lightweight comical comment on modern marriage, a dark variant beats beneath the surface. A constant emotion of the decomposition of love reigns. For its personal portrayal of marriage \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" is related to Hitchcock's other works, such as \"Rich and Strange\", in which the illusion of money and the silence of love are dominant themes, and \"Suspicion\" where marriage includes a strong shadow of doubt and distrust. For Hitchcock, marriage seems to be a normative institution, controlled by money and monitored by the community, which leaves no room for real emotions. It is as if all marital action was based on cheat, deceit and oppression. \n\nThe Smiths, for example, are instantly ready to divorce after hearing about a legal error -- their marriage was never verified -- because there had been no real feelings whatsoever for years. A mere technicality held the unsteady edifice of love together. Later on, the film warms up a little as the cool cynicism of the beginning settles. However, the pessimistically realist mood remains as an echo, a subtext, until the very end.\n\nIn the field of narrative, Hitchcock continues to develop the sensation of anxiety, presented in the opening tracking shot, by using poignant identification. In American comedy, objective observation is often used by filmmakers (screwball is a \"report of madness\", so to speak) but Hitchcock prefers to stick to the subjective perspective. It's crucial that he never alienates events, gags nor characters. As a consequence of this, the jokes never amuse the people to whom they are aimed at.",

Not only was she among the most effervescent of screen comediennes during Hollywood's golden age, at 32, she was simply that beautiful in this 1941 film strikingly transferred onto DVD. This was her penultimate film, released less than a year before her tragic death in a plane crash, but it provides a nice, if not spectacular, showcase for her skills in both screwball and drawing room comedy. As Ann and David Smith, a volatile married couple who find out that their marriage is not legal due to a jurisdiction technicality, Lombard co-stars with Robert Montgomery, who excelled in light comedy but remains relatively forgotten today compared to his peers, Cary Grant and William Powell.\n\nAt first glance, it is amazing to believe that Alfred Hithcock directed this confection given the master of suspense was between two classics, \"Rebecca\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\", but if you look closely enough, you will likely notice quite a few of his touches, including his cameo walk-on appearance in front of the Smiths' 72nd Street apartment building. There is an occasional odd close-up, for instance, of a lamp cord that Ann trips over, or subtly threatening scenes, such as when Ann shaves David with an open razor or when Ann and her suitor get stuck high above a crowd in a parachute ride - all these moments seem Hitchcokian in hindsight. However, it's really the clever though predictable script by Norman Krasna and the romantic sparring of the leads that dominates the film.\n\nThe bulk of the story is how David tries to win back Ann, who is smarting from the fact that David did not let her know they were not legally married. She finds out from the clerk who was assigned to inform the married couple of their illegal status since he is from her hometown. In the meantime, David is forced to stay at his men's club (the norm for thirties comedies), while Ann is courted by his law partner Jefferson, who is the epitome of Southern gentility. Plenty of shenanigans ensue until the inevitable ending, though the pacing of the film feels sluggish at times, which is a shame given its relatively short 95-minute running time. At the same time, I think this may have been intentional since it seems ultimately more a character-driven comedy than a situation-derived farce.\n\nMontgomery lacks Grant's erudite manner and physical dexterity, but he has an easy, pugnacious charm. Playing the stock Ralph Bellamy, third-wheel role, Gene Raymond - perhaps best known for romancing Dolores Del Rio in the first Astaire-Rogers musical, \"Flying Down to Rio\" - is a surprisingly sturdy comic foil as Jefferson. Along with the original trailer, the DVD package includes an informative sixteen-minute documentary, \"Mr. Hitchcock Meets the Smiths\", produced just in 2004. It includes comments from directors Peter Bogdanovich and Richard Franklin; film historians Robert Osborne and Richard Schickel; Hitchcock's daughter Pat; and his granddaughter Mary. They all wax fondly on the master director's dry, sometimes caustic sense of humor and how it came in handy making this film. This comedy is not in the same league as other screwball comedies such as \"Bringing Up Baby\" or Lombard's cherished \"My Man Godfrey\". However, any time Lombard shows up, the screen simply lights up. What a tragedy that she didn't have a longer career.",

                "text": "Wealthy lawyer Robert Montgomery (as David Smith) and beautiful Carole Lombard (as Ann \"Annie\" Krausheimer) frequently battle, but are nonetheless happily married. Then, due to some mistake concerning county ordinances, they are informed their marriage wasn't legal. Initially, this is taken as a chance to become newlyweds again - but misunderstandings lead to bickering and the couple wonder if they should really be \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\". Ms. Lombard dates his law partner Gene Raymond (Jefferson \"Jeff\" Custer) and Mr. Montgomery jealously follows them to Lake Placid...\n\nWhile not listed as a re-make of anything in particular, this is an old plot. With Lombard and Montgomery co-starring, you would expect much more. Having Alfred Hitchcock direct Montgomery giving himself a nosebleed wasn't exactly good comedy. Betty Compson (as Gertie) has a funny cameo, though, and the \"crossed ski\" end clicks. Thankfully, Mr. Hitchcock decided to concentrate on suspense thrillers. This was Lombard's penultimate performance; she manages to stay above the material here, and gets another fine film done before leaving this world in a plane crash.\n\n***** Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1/31/41) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Carole Lombard, Robert Montgomery, Gene Raymond, Betty Compson",

This is one married couple who likes to fight and make up, and when it's discovered that they need to remarry and Mr. Smith doesn't rush into it, Mrs. Smith becomes Miss Krausheimer again in a hurry and starts dating her pseudo-husband's business partner, Gene Raymond, a southern gent.\n\nThere are some very funny scenes and good performances, but I agree with the other posters that Mrs. Smith is one unforgiving woman, while Mr. Smith is quite a sympathetic character in his attempts to woo her back. Nevertheless, for fans of the actors and as a genuine Hitchcock artifact, it's worth seeing. Hard to believe that the beautiful Lombard would die after making just one more film.\n\nI thought Robert Montgomery was great in his role, and I particularly enjoyed the scene at the restaurant where he says, \"That cat knows something,\" when the cat wouldn't eat any of his soup.

                "text": "\nQuite a feat, to make Carole Lombard in her prime come across as dull and whiney!\n\nThe problems start with Krasna`s script. No one expects a striking storyline with this sort of comedy - the pleasure (if any) comes in the treatment.\n\n\nThere needs to be wit - woefully lacking here - but also real sympathy between the leads. Here, the set-up - Lombard`s \u0091rules of marriage', and not leaving the bedroom before settling a quarrel - comes across as pettifogging, not romantic. \n\nMontgomery keeps quiet about the marriage being null, but gets (or gives) no pleasure from the deception. And, when Lombard finally decides he's not going to tell her, she behaves like an outraged nun.\n\nThe delight of this sort of film, when well done, is the combination of worldweariness and genuine affection and zest for life - \u0091The Philadelphia Story' immediately springs to mind. Here, the couple seem at the start to be going through the motions of love (why else the need for rules?); and their separation is equally devoid of real passion.\n\nAny amount of one-liners won't compensate for this basic lack of heart - and there aren't too many of those anyway. And a film like this needs solid performances from the second bananas - here, from the steam-bath Lothario to Montgomery's vulgar blind date, they all disappear without trace. (Compare the \u0091Philadelphia Story''s Virginia Weidler (\u0091Lydia') and Ruth Hussey (hurting, but seeing the silver lining for her in her inexperienced lover straying with Hepburn).)\n\nHitchcock seems all at sea with Hollywood budgets and conventions in a genre with which he was unfamiliar. There is a bloated feel to the piece quite alien to his best English work. In \u009139 Steps', just six years earlier, with much slenderer means, he produces stunning performances from the three main actresses. And scenes between his leads Carroll and Donat where humour and mutual affection arise organically. He uses conventions from the silent era freely, and is comfortable with his way of working.\n\nEssentially a transitional - almost an apprentice - piece: for Hitchcock scholars only. (Except the first shot of Lombard in bed, dollying in just for her right eye and nose to emerge from beneath the covers - the most adorable of her that I've seen. But scarcely worth renting the video for!)\n\n(Lombard joined a long line of actresses who didn't do much in films after working with Hitchcock - pity this had to be her penultimate feature.)\n\n",

I found that Jeff (Gene Raymond) got most of the laughs playing the straight man - he has a great drunk scene.\n\nSo, it's no great shakes as a comedy, but it has interest in other categories. For one thing it is interesting to get a take on the times from when the film was made. \n\nWhen Ann (Lombard) and David (Montgomery) find out that their marriage of three years was never legal, they pause to reevaluate. Although we know how things will end up, the very idea of marriage not being the ideal living arrangement comes close to violating the \"Production Code\" in force at the time. Also, if Jeff were to appear in a recent film, he would probably be assumed to be gay - a successful, handsome, intelligent, unmarried man in his 30s who takes great pride in having decorated his own apartment.\n\nAnn strikes out on her own and gets a job (in an early foreshadowing of the women's movement), but when David clouds the issue of her marital status with her boss, the boss says that the company is not allowed to hire married women due to job shortages.\n\nThere are some Hitchcock directorial touches like the scenes at the fair - the parachute ride in particular. \n\nI had trouble with Ann and David's relationship. I could never see what it was about Ann that had David so much in thrall, particularly the way she treated him during their separation. And they never seemed to have any great chemistry between them on screen.\n\nI suppose seeing Hitchcock's one stab at comedy is of some historic interest, but he wisely turned his efforts elsewhere, as a potential viewer of this movie might as well.",

It is his story and script that makes the whole thing work and it is a type of film he seemed to do well with. The concept is a bit forced early on but the majority of it moves with such wit and sparkle that I really didn't mind too much. The script has plenty of nice scenarios that are amusing and, although I didn't roar with laughter, I did really enjoy it. The characters aren't deep enough to get into, but luckily the performances are strong enough to carry that side of things and keep us with the characters.\n\nLombard in particular is good and she has the showier role \u0096 or at least the louder one. Montgomery is as good but in a different way, being much more subtle and drawing many funny moments out of little things. Support from Raymond and others is all good enough and matches the general humour of the piece but really it is the lead two who make the film work well.\n\nOverall an enjoyable and amusing comedy that is witty and sparky throughout.

And this time, the accent is on his girl troubles. It's kind of amusing just to see the pretty ANN RUTHERFORD and a very young LANA TURNER throwing themselves at Rooney the way they do--I mean, let's fact it, he was never a looker.\n\nGone are the days when teens dressed like they do here--Rooney wearing a derby on a bright summer day and not a pair of jeans in sight. The script has Ann Rutherford's Polly going away on a Christmas visit to an aunt, which gives Rooney an excuse to discover Lana Turner's Cynthia at a swimming pool. She serves as his playmate for this particular Hardy story and it's easy to see why MGM kept her under contract for years to come.\n\nJUDY GARLAND is Betsy Booth, who announces right at the start that she's \"going to be on the stage some day\"--and was that a good prediction! She also gets to sing a few numbers in the now famous Garland style.\n\nThe plot ambles along predictably and pleasantly, as most Hardy films do, and suffice it to say that Rooney's fling with Lana Turner is the most enjoyable aspect of the story and well played by both youngsters. But boy, could he mug! Yes, even then, he dispensed with some pretty extravagant bits of mugging that became more and more pronounced as the years went on. Some called it talent--others may have disagreed. Whatever it was, he was a very popular box-office star at the time this one was made.\n\nSumming up: Pleasant enough for Hardy fans, and certainly a reminder of how different times were for teens in the late '30s.",

Seitz.\n\nAndy loves Polly, but when a friend asks him to take care of the beautiful Cynthia, he complies. Enter the girl-next-door, Betsy, and the problems begin. As usual, the fatherly figure of Judge James K. Hardy, is there to guide his young son into doing the right thing. In fact, Andy and his parents didn't suffer from the generation gap that became prevalent later on; the openness of family relationships of that time is so refreshing and shows how much has been lost. It probably had to do with a loving mother, Emily, who stayed home and supervised her children.\n\nThe cast is delightful. Mickey Rooney shows why he was one of the most loved actors of the time. Judy Garland is a sweet Betsy and has an opportunity to sing three songs in the film. Lewis Stone and Fay Holden as the Hardy parents, are good and solid. Cecilia Parker is sister Marian.

But when you've got Judy Garland, Lana Turner, and Ann Rutherford all chasing you in the same film, you must be doing something right.\n\nThose who followed the doings of the Hardy family in the theaters back in the day and on TCM now are aware of Mickey's girl friend Ann Rutherford who plays Polly Benedict in the series. Ann's going away from Carvel for the Christmas holidays and Andy has no one to take to the winter dance. Then at the same time he meets Judy Garland who is staying next door to the Hardys visiting an aunt and gets introduced to his friend Beezy's girl friend Lana Turner. Somehow the image of Lana Turner ever going out with a person named 'Beezy' doesn't compute.\n\nStill Beezy who is played in the series by George Breakston is also going out of town and before long Rooney's got two dates to the dance with Garland and Turner and an unexpected Ann Rutherford returning home.\n\nNow since this was right in the beginning of the Hardy series, you know Mickey got out of it and lived to romance another day. But Love Finds Andy Hardy if it belongs to anyone in the cast, the film is definitely Judy Garland's. Her personality so winning, there was never a question about her becoming a great star. She has some good songs to sing with In-Between and It Never Rains, But What It Pours which she sings well, but should have been Mickey's theme for this film.\n\nWhat I liked best in the film is how Judy with a little psychology managed to get Rooney out of his entanglement with Turner. That's worth seeing the film alone for. There is also a couple of nice subplots involving a wayward juvenile before Judge Hardy played by Gene Reynolds and the fact that Mother (Fay Holden) is away at Christmas time tending to her mother. \n\nLove Finds Andy Hardy is an average film for the series, but it's a milestone in that two screen legends who were very different types on the screen got significant career boosts from this film.",

I didn't not think it was going to be very good but it was amazing, not only that it was very funny. Judy has three numbers (In Between, It never Rains but What it Pours, Meet the Beat of my heart) which she sings brilliantly. Judy's acting in this film is also very good, and her continuous attempts to impress Andy are a mixture of comedy and sadness. \n\nAs for Mickey Rooney, I have never seen him in a film before and he too is also very funny. So with Judy and Mickey you have the perfect pair. I now understand why they did so many pictures together and it is a shame they don't sell more of them on DVD. \n\nLana Turner and Ann Rutherford also are great comedy stars, acting as posh, spoilt brats. \n\nAll in all I think Love finds Andy Hardy is a amazing film and everyone should own a copy of it on DVD or Video!\n\n  ",

So, while I was out for the day visiting the family I let my VCR record about three or four of these things. I just randomly began with this one, which I enjoyed and have since read is considered one of the better installments.\n\nHere we have Mickey Rooney (I can't believe he was actually 18 when he made this) getting involved with two other girls once his main squeeze Polly (Ann Rutherford) has to go away to visit her grandma for Christmas. Andy's been looking to raise twenty dollars (!) to buy a car he's had his eye on, so while Polly's gone, Andy accepts his friend Beezy's offer to get paid to date his girlfriend Cynthia (Lana Turner) while Beezy's also out of town for Christmas. From there, \"troubles\" erupt when Cynthia gets way too stuck on Andy, and then his singing neighbor Betsy (Judy Garland) also starts to fall in love with him. Wish I had problems like that when I was 15! \n\nWhile watching this film, you can't help become aware of how drastically times have changed in 70 years. This is a wholesome family affair. It was a joy watching Lewis Stone as Andy's old dad, Judge James Hardy, trying to bridge the generation gap (such as it was in the '30s) between father and son, and having his heart to heart talks with his boy. Mickey Rooney's characterization of the highly animated Andy Hardy was infectious, and I thought all three of his well-known leading ladies were cute. Judy sings a few tunes, of course, and I didn't mind them a bit. It seemed to me, though, that she was relegated more to the background for this story, unfortunately.

All he has to do is date his best friend's girlfriend (Lana Turner) while he's out of town as he doesn't want her going around with any other boys. Things don't go as planned but at least Andy has his new neighbor (Judy Garland) who just happens to have a few plans of her own. This fourth film in the series is often considered by man to be the best but I'm not certain I'd go that far. If someone is looking for pure laughs there are funnier films in the series but at the same time it's easy to see why this one would get so much attention due to the terrific cast. I guess you could say Andy is the luckiest guy in the world if his biggest problem is dating women like Garland, Turner and Rutherford but that's the major of the film's storyline. There are a few minor subplots dealing with Judge (Lewis Stone) having to take care of the fort when his wife (Fay Holden) leaves to take care of her ill mother. I'm guessing mom was pretty much written out of this one simply because you had so many other characters that needed attention. Apparently this film was shot in just 19 days and was released to theaters less than two months after it was given the green light. It's hard to imagine any movie being written, shot and shown in such a short period of time but I guess you have to give the MGM factory credit for this. Even though I wouldn't name this the best of the series there are still enough good moments to make it a must see. The majority of the charm comes from Rooney and his energy as he tries to get through all these situations while at the same time learning various life lessons. It's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Andy Hardy as Rooney is pitch perfect for it and he matches well with the three females. He and Rutherford always had that great charm in each film but the real shock was seeing how good he was with Turner. The two really seem to have great chemistry and this comes across during a terrific scene in the woods where they kiss and Rooney lets out a scream of pleasure to which Turner then laughs in hysterics. Garland certainly gets the majority of the screen time and she does a fine job as well. She also gets to sing three songs, which she does a good job with even though none of the songs are all that memorable. It goes without saying but Lewis Stone is at the top of his game as normal. LOVE FINDS ANDY HARDY is certainly a flick that any film buff should see simply because of the great cast. It's hard to think of a film with more young talent but they all deliver the goods and make this an entertaining little gem.",

                "text": "If \"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry\" was the seed that planted the idea of a Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland pairing in Louis B. Mayer's mind, then this film becomes the root that puts it all together. It is a likable, if sheer fantasy, story of teen love during the post-depression and pre-war days of America. Louis B. Mayer thought that the American family was the glue that would keep us free, and if he wasn't exactly Judge James Hardy in real life, he certainly tried to emulate him in the minds of his stable of MGM stars. In the case of the three young stars here (Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Lana Turner), he was a major factor in their growing up period, good or bad.\n\nThe story covers Andy's dilemma of not having a date for the Christmas dance after his girlfriend Polly (Ann Rutherford) announced that she would be away for the holidays. One of his friends asks him to take his girlfriend (Lana Turner) to the dance since he is being taken away by his family as well, and Andy agrees. Then, there is the visitor next door: the younger but somewhat more level-headed Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) who has an instant crush on Andy. She cries out \"No glamor!\" about herself when he politely rebuffs her, but later saves the day when Polly returns, finds out Andy was taking out another girl, and he ends up at the dance anyway thanks to Betsy. Garland gets to sing three songs, two of which are at the dance, and Andy is surprised to find the girl he considered a baby was not that at all. And when Betsy is asked to lead the \"Grand March\", she asks Mickey to accompany her, making him realize that she is more than he gave her credit for.\n\nThis film focuses more on Rooney and Garland than the rest of the family. Sure, Ma Hardy is away because her mother is ill, so the judge hires a cook (Marie Blake, aka Blossom Rock, aka Grandma Addams) to save the family from sister Cecilia Parker's cooking. Fay Holden makes a token appearance at the beginning and end of the film, and for this segment of the series, it is Betsy Ross Clarke, not Sara Haden, who plays Aunt Millie. Rooney and Parker do their typical share of sibling arguing, but it's all really over nothing and seems silly in retrospect. But when you've got two future superstars like Garland and Turner to watch, it's all harmless fun. Sure, this series, like \"The Brady Bunch\", isn't like any family, so young audiences of today might consider it ridiculous. It's also hard to watch Garland sing the sad \"In Between\", since she had to belittle herself in practically every film she did with Rooney by singing a number over her lack of glamor, inability to land a man, or how ugly she was in comparison to the other ladies around her. No wonder she had such insecurities, she has to shout them to the world up on the silver screen! Fortunately, the character is a lot less frenetic than her character in \"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry\", so she's a bit more real. Rooney is his usual bombastic self but the character is hard not to like, just in minimal doses. Three or more Andy Hardy films in one sitting can bring on a tooth ache! Turner is only in the film for several scenes, including one with Garland, but within two years, she would find the look that would lead her to super-stardom by the beginning of the war.",

According to TCM, Judy was 16, Lana 17 and Ann 18 at the time. But Andy's character is supposed to be 15, \"waiting to be 16.\" Remarkable how Judy has It here, the voice and the looks.

                "text": "\"Love finds Andy Hardy\" is one of the best among three Hardy films. This films greatness is largely helped by Ann Rutherford, Lana Turner, and a wonderful young Judy Garland. Judy is the girl who adds the sweet wonder to so many of her films with her innocence, her passion, her beauty, and that voice of an angel. Judy's \"I'm just an in between\" is tear jerking. It makes me so frustrated with Andy for hurting her feelings. Lana Turner is also beautiful and charming as Andy's friend Siggy's girl when Siggy promises Andy $8 for pretending to go out with her to keep the other fellas away. Ann Rutherford is the other beautiful, charming gal. Fellas, gals. I just love the way young people talked back then, such a far cry away from the way they talk today. It was such a nicer, more innocent world. Anyway, Andy wants to buy a car but he only has twelve bucks out of the $20 he needs for it. Siggy promises Andy the other $8 if he keeps the other fellas away from Lana. Meanwhile, Ann, Andy's usual girl, is going out of town for a couple weeks. But we still get a couple of sweet scenes with her, including a touching scene with her and Andy when she's returned and found out what's been going on. The scenes with Judy are wonderful, as always with Judy in her films, including the soda shop. Judy and Andy then both act in such a good wholesome way that no one would ever see young people acting today. How much of a heart of gold does this girl have, when so kindly offering to give Andy the $8 he needs. Andy declines it, but that is understandable being a gentleman in those days. But still, Judy's offers, she is so pure and full off true goodness. And she offers to give Andy the $8 too, not lend it. $8 in 1938 was equal to over $100 today. And then Andy ignores Judy, and she sings her \"In between\" with tears. It is sad but Judy didn't understand that she was just too young. Andy's dad Judge Hardy also has some good scenes while at work, and with the family. Judge Hardy and son also have their heart to heart, a common theme of the Hardy films. There's also some sadness with a family member getting a stroke. I often wonder why human beings are so enormously different today than they were back then. Just saying \"the times have changed\" isn't enough. Its also this: nearly every person that was around back then is now gone, except a percentage of the very elderly, all over 80, and they were only the small children back then. And just about everyone in the world today, except those over 80 years old, didn't exist yet back then. People haven't changed, it's just different people.",

The fact this was Judy Garland's first appearance in the series was the main reason I sought this out and boy, she's sensational when she sings here! Now that I'm watching each entry in sequence, I noticed how past eps are referenced such as Andy mentioning to Betsy Booth (Ms. Garland's character) teaching the Big Apple to some diplomats in Washington, D.C., in Judge Hardy's Children. Anyway, Andy is in a real pickle: He wants a car but he doesn't have enough money so he agrees-with pay-to date Cynthia (a young Lana Turner) while her boyfriend-and Andy's pal-Beezy is away while Polly (Ann Rutherford, of course) is also somewhere else. Betsy herself has a crush on Andy but he's oblivious to her. Judy really shows her feelings clearly here when playing her as a bit disappointed with how Mickey goes into how much he loves Polly or was initially excited by Cynthia. There's also a subplot of Emily and Milly having to leave to visit their mother when she's revealed to be in a coma which has Fay Holden and Betty Ross Clarke off-screen much of the time. Anyway, this was a most enjoyable entry of the Hardy family series mainly because of the three songs sung by Ms. Garland as well as Mickey's scenes with her and Lana Turner. Also, nice seeing the future Grandmama from \"The Addams Family\" (Blossom Rock, then known as Marie Blake) as the temporary family cook and Gene Reynolds-later a producer/director of \"Hogan's Heroes\" and \"M*A*S*H\"-as a kid who uses a ham radio to relay a message to Mrs. Hardy in Canada. So on that note, Love Finds Andy Hardy is highly recommended. P.S. The DVD I watched this on had a wonderful intro by John Fricke with a brief insert interview with Ms. Rutherford herself.",

This time around our clean-scrubbed but calculating protagonist is bursting at the seams to buy himself a car so he can dress up in his tuxedo and drive a smashing dame to a Christmas dance. He finds himself torn between two girls while admired from afar by another one. Mickey Rooney played the youngster from a teenage bachelor to an adult father with a wife and children. These family-oriented films presents a strong, morally-stable family unit with Andy respecting his stern but indulgent dad, the venerable Judge James K. Hardy (Lewis Stone of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\"), and his mother Emily (Fay Holden of \"Guns of the Pecos\") while enduring a contentious relationship with his older sister, Marion Hardy (Cecilia Parker of \"Riders of Destiny\") who never misses an opportunity to take him to task for something. \"Last of the Mohicans\" director George B. Seitz helms this romantic comedy focuses on the predicament that Andy finds himself in when he puts down $12 dollars on a roadster but must still pay off the balance of the cost $8 dollars in time to take his girlfriend Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford of \"Gone with the Wind\") to the Christmas dance. Meanwhile, Andy's mother Emily receives bad news from her own mother in Canada that she isn't feeling well. Naturally, Emily rushes to his mother's bedside while the Judge hires an experienced cook Augusta (Marie Blake of \"The Best Man\"), to take over cooking and cleaning duties when Marian cannot pass muster. The predicament that Andy's mom finds herself in constitutes the most dramatic thread in \"Oklahoma!\" scenarist William Ludwig's plot while Andy tries to extract himself from his own difficulties. The theme of responsibility and behaving like a grown-up pervades this adaptation of Vivien R. Bretherton's wholesome stories and characters. The action also involves Andy's temporary next door neighbor, Betsy Booth (Judy Garland of \"Broadway Melody of 1938\"), who is visiting Carvel while her mother rehearses for a musical comedy in Chicago. Predictably, Betsy falls head over heels for Andy. Andy tries to help another school pal, Francis Bacon Anderson (George P. Breakston of \"Geisha Girl \") who learns that his parents plan to take him out of town for three weeks. The problem is that Beezy--as he is called--has just hooked up with a beautiful, but haughty girl, Cynthia Potter (Lana Turner of \"They Won't Forget\") and he wants Andy to date her until he can return. Beezy promises to pay Andy the amount of $8.50 for serving as his stand-in while he is gone. Andy learns to his chagrin that all Cynthia likes to do is kiss, kiss, and kiss some more. She is a afraid to play tennis for fear of developing unsightly muscles and afraid to swim because of what is will do to her coiffure. This quaint, old-fashioned entertainment provides a snapshot of American values during the late 1930s as World War II swept over the rest of the world. Of course, there is a happy ending in this sappy nonsense and all crisis are resolved.",

In fact, the only decent acting (amongst the major actors) comes from Lewis Stone, but he looks so out of place with the rest of the cast, that at first you think he's the bad one. Stone's delivery is actually very well timed and delivered with aplomb, but this doesn't match the rest of the cast, and it is initially easier to put the blame on him, rather than the real perpetrators of the poor delivery. Oh yes, I should add that Judy Garland has considerable talents, but none of them are properly exploited in this filmic dross. 1939 was destined to be her best year (Wizard of Oz).\n\nThe script is dire, and worthy only of an essay written by an average 10 year-old. In fact, it is often worse, and quite confused. For instance, the scene where Rooney is asking Stone for money to buy a car is probably the worst bit of writing I have ever seen on screen. Actually, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' positively shines, and becomes worthy of an Oscar in comparison.\n\nOn a more personal level, I did enjoy the inclusion of the 'Ham Radio' scenes, as it was in its infancy in 1938. I found it interesting to see that all the procedures and conventions had already evolved into much the same form that is still used today. However, I should also add that this does not mean that the actors were up to the task of being convincing during the said scenes. Far from it, in fact.\n\nTo be fair, the technical values of this film are good, for the time. There are some nice camera angles and the use of light and dark was almost up to 'The Third Man' standard. Unfortunately, the script and acting let it down.\n\nI have not seen any of the other Andy Hardy films, so I have no way of comparing them. Now I have seen this one, I am a bit loath to 'dip my toes' in any of the others! Overall, I gave this film a 2/10 rating, but I wonder if that should really have been a 1?

Hassan enlists the aid of the chief Chamberlain, Faud (Frank Lackteen, untrustworthy as usual)and they send several henchmen into the royal palace, who then knock Kasim unconscious. Faud and Hassan, hanging around at the palace to tidy up their coup, dispatch a couple of different hirelings to take Kasim into another part of the town and murder him. But before they can find the correct part of the city in which to kill and leave a body, Kasin comes to and, after a furious fight among the stunt-men, Kasim gets away, but has been wounded.\n\nOmar (Ben Welden), a beggar, takes Kasim to his home and nurses him back to health. But, it takes a few weeks for Kasin to get healthy and, by that time, Hassan has a firm grip on the duties of a Caliph and the chances of Kasim walking back into the palace and taking back his job are slim-to-none. He wastes some good serial-action time by going to the public square and denouncing Hassim as an impostor, but nobody hanging around the square believes him, and it isn't long before the royal gendarmes or high sheriffs from the palace show up and chase him off.\n\nIn a storeroom, Kasim finds a coat of mail with a great hawk emblazoned across the chest and promptly decides this is the costume he will wear while fighting to get his old job back. The costume has a story and some history behind it, so Kasim just didn't decide he would don this costume just because it was the only item in the storeroom. Plus a hood and a cloak and a sword and a whip and a john-brown belt went with it, so it isn't like Kasim was going to wage war wearing just a shirt with a hawk stitched on it.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the palace, the Emir of Telif (Georges Remarent) shows up with his shapely daughter, Princess Azala (Mona Maris), with the intent of marrying her off to the local Caliph and, possibly ensure that in the event that the kingdom of Ahad rulers are looking to enlarge their borders, they will look in another direction other than toward Talez. But the Emir and Azala are under the impression that Kasin is the Caliph and they have good reports on him from some of the Talez citizens that have visited Ahad in the past. They do not know that the current-Caliph on the royal-throne is the evil twin-brother of the man they had gotten good reports on.\n\nKasin, as The Desert Hawk, sword-fights his way in and out of the palace and, after throwing some longing glances at the babes in what used to be his harem, meets Azala and is smitten. But, despite the fact he can not prove to her that he is nothing but an outlaw, who happens to look like the Caliph, he does win her confidence.\n\nSo, aided by Azala, Kasim/ the Desert Hawk begins his quest to foil Hassan's attempt to victimize the citizens of Ahad, while gathering proof that will expose the false Caliph.\n\nPlace this one near the top half of the middle-third of the Columbia serials, which makes it better than those that followed after Sam Katzman took over the serial-production for Columbia.",

Most serial fans are familar with the plot, and besides, it is posted right here on the internet, so I will go on to the cast. Tom Tyler, probably more familar to film buffs as Luke Plummer in John Ford's classic STAGECOACH, looks the part of Captain Marvel to perfection. He has relatively few dialog scenes in the serial, however, and to some people this is an added bonus, as his extremely gravelly voice is not to everyone's taste Young Frank Coghlan Jr. is remarkably good as Billy Batson, and deserves additional acclaim as Republic's only juvenile serial hero. The incomparable William Benedict provides unobtrusive comedy relief, as he was to do the following year in NYOKA AND THE TIGERMEN. Benedict is my all-time favorite serial sidekick, even though he only did these two. Louise Currie, who was also to make a return date three years later in THE MASKED MARVEL, is a very likable heroine, and as for the Scorpion, he has got to be the best villain in serials, thanks largely to Gerald Mohr's voice. His closet competitors are probably Dr. Satan(Eduardo Cianelli), Captain Mephisto(Roy Barcroft) from MANHUNT OF MYSTERY ISLAND) and Jim Belmont(George J. Lewis) from FEDERAL OPERATOR 99. Kenne Duncan gives a good performance as Barnett, the Scorpion's chief henchman, and Reed Hadley also stand out as Rahman Bar, the Scorpion's Siamese cohort. The supporting cast includes silent serial great Jack Mulhall, and, as suspects for being the Scorpion, Harry Worth, Robert Strange, George Pembroke, Bryant Washburn, Peter George Lynn, and the wonderful scene-stealer John Davidson as the superstious Siamese, Tah Chotali. The special effects are positively astonishing, and hold up a lot better than modern high-tech effects do. After watching the serial, you simply have to conclude that Captain Marvel CAN fly. This certainly deserves its reputation as the greatest serial ever made. SHAZAM!",

Of course, it has the usual failings of most serials -- low budget, short shooting schedule, a few bumps and wrinkles along the way -- but if that bothers you, you are probably one of those viewers who complain about the plots of Jackie Chan films. Frank Coughlan, Jr., does creditable work as Billy Batson, while Tom Tyler (Stagecoach, Red River) makes a robust Captain Marvel. Fans of Indiana Jones will love this, especially the sets in Chapter One. The best part about Capt. Marvel is his occasional shortage of a sense of fair play. (When was the last time you saw Superman machine gun three guys in the back as they ran away?) This is one super hero who doesn't play around. I also love Tyler's evil grin as bullets bounce off his chest and his propensity for pimp-slapping the bad guys when they don't answer his questions quickly enough. Also, look for Reed Hadley (Zorro) as one of the bad guys; unmistakable due to his superb voice. Hadley narrated A-bomb training films for the US government and had high level security clearance for the job. The other big plus of Capt. Marvel is the ground-breaking flying effects by the Lydeckers, using wires, dummies, reversed film and the leaping skills of stuntman Dave Sharpe. If you love adventure serials, you'll love The Adventures of Captain Marvel. Highly recommended is the DVD release from Artisan.",

                "text": "This is my first full-length serial, and, I must confess surprisingly, that I truly enjoyed each and every minute of it. The story tells of a young man named Billy Batson and how he, having refused to enter the tomb of an ancient people with a curse while being part of an archaeological/treasure hunting team, is bestowed great powers by Shazaam. Batson turns into Captain Marvel when he utters the word Shazaam. This serial is a lot better crafted than I initially thought it would be. The sets used in this Rebublic Pictures production are very good and believable. The acting is very adequate with Frank Coghlan Jr. giving a very honest and sincere performance as Billy albeit somewhat corny perhaps. Tom Tyler plays his alter ego Captain Marvel - and while looking somewhat haggard is acceptable. All the other performers are good with John Davidson standing out as Tal Chotali - a native guide for the group. The 12 chapters of this serial tell of how each investor in the team was given a special lens of a gold scorpion found in the ancient tomb. When all the lenses are placed properly on the scorpion, it can make gold out of anything. Well, a villain named the Scorpion comes into the mix. He is covered from head to foot in a mask and costume so as not to reveal his identity because he is one of the men in the team. Each episode tells of various plots the scorpion invents to secure the lenses and thwart Captain Marvel. In true serial fashion, each chapter ends with a thrilling and exciting cliffhanger of sorts. Originally these were shown weekly with pictures and made to be exciting and suspenseful so as to entice movie-goers to return each week. Directors William Witney and John English succeed in making the viewer want to see what happens. Each chapter was packed with action and mystery. Plenty of red herrings are thrown at you so as to confuse you to who could or would be the real identity of the Scorpion. It was so refreshing to see Captain Marvel be a real super hero. He doles out real justice to real crooks. No feminization of Captain Marvel here. Sure, some of the story is pretty hokey, and, yes, some plot twists totally unrealistic(how about the scene where Betty Wallace,Batson's pseudo-love interest, is careening around one bend after another in a garage while knocked out), but the product as a whole was very compelling. I had to watch all 12 chapters in one sitting just to find out who the script chose to be the Scorpion. This serial made me a believer and makes me want to check out some of these rather forgotten films of the past.",

So, after taking the machine gun away from some of the evil Scorpion Gang, he turns the gun on them and shoots them in the back as they run away with their hands raised!!!

I said to myself as to what type of a superhero movie they could make back in 1941. I decided I'll watch it to get a couple of laughs at their attempt to make one, knowing the limitations in cinema during the 1940's than compared with what we have today. Needless to say, I was quite impressed by what was done. It was truly a marvel to watch how much thought was considered in the production of this film.\n\nThe good writing along with some subtle twist of plots and cliff hangers on each of the 12 segments, were done in such a way to hold an audience interest. The flying scenes were more than adequate to fool an audience(kids), even if we could see a pulley line used in a few instances(in fact a pulley was used as part of the story for the characters within a scene, probably the same one in filming the visual effects, a little irony). The thought of miniature models for special effects by the Lydecker Brothers production of cars and volcanoes, were done so cleverly with different camera angle shots, it just demonstrated that they were really ahead of their time.\n\nEven if the same plot device was constantly repeated, this was so Billy wouldn't be recognized when he turned into Captain Marvel, it fitted the limitations of a 1941 film of a superhero movie. I enjoyed the fact this was made a serious tone for the most part, there were no real attempts to be funny from the villain or his henchman. Captain Marvel in his role here was strictly business. He rarely talked much, and was quite brutal in fighting, throwing men around without much a blink of an eye of their fate.It was also unusual towards the end of the serial did a character asked him to identify who he was. \n\nOf course, the characters speech rhythm, its story pace and a few comical character stunts are present of this films' era, but it doesn't detract from their attempt for a good production. I would go on to say I prefer this over Daredevil, both HULK movies(although the last one was better), the Ghost Riders series, who have far superior cinema technology for them to make a better superhero film.\n\nI recommend it for anyone who enjoys old films, the superhero genre, and curious how films like this were created, to go seek the time and view this serial picture.",

                "text": "This is one of the 2 best movie serials of all time. I would recommend that any fan of escapist cinema and classic movies see at least a couple of the chapters, since it is such a fine example of what a good serial could be. It is fast paced, has good fight scenes, and, for the time period, excellent special effects. In fact, until perhaps the 1978 film 'Superman,' there were no superior the flying sequences anywhere on TV or cinema. Along with these legendary sequences, the screen presence and performance of Tom Tyler really make this a magical experience.\n\nAt the time of this serial, Tom Tyler was a veteran (and underrated) movie actor, entering the downward slide of a career. Besides having about 15 years of fight scenes on his resume, he had been both a lumberjack and a champion weight lifter, so that he had a lean, athletic physique and carried himself like a strong and tough man. Also, his chiseled facial features, dark hair and steely eyes projected determination and formidability. Although given very few lines, Tyler was completely believable and magnetic in the role. Tyler's Captain Marvel is truly one of the most awesome serial heroes, right up there with Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon. Frank Coghlan Jr. is perfect as Cap's alter ego, Billy Batson, and the rest of the supporting cast is good as well.\n\nFans of the comic book and TV versions of Captain Marvel should be warned that this serial is, in several significant ways, very different from the Cap they remember. Part of this is due to the fact that whenever Republic Pictures adapted a comic strip, they took some liberties. The other factor is that this serial was filmed when the Captain Marvel comic strip was only 1 year old, before the tone and spirit of Captain Marvel had been established (the Captain Marvel comics did not really develop a consistent style or sensibility until about 1943 or so; it isn't till around that time that the really classic Captain Marvel stuff started coming out).\n\nWithout spoiling too much, viewers should be warned that on at least 2 occasions, Captain Marvel summarily dispatches some of the minor villains. Dispatch, as in sending them to meet their maker. This is understandable within the context of the times and 1930's ideal of a hero. In 1941, comic book heroes had not settled into their now ubiquitous code of non-lethality. The forerunners of the super-heroes, the pulp heroes such as the Shadow and the Spider, had no reservations toward casually gunning down a few thugs. Likewise, audiences in 1941 were of a generation that witnessed law enforcement officers summarily executing Bonnie & Clyde as well as John Dillinger.\n\nCaptain Marvel's readiness to kill might also serve as a rationale for Billy's hesitancy to use his alter ego. In this version, Billy gets into fistfights with thugs, even when he is outnumbered, rather than turning into Cap. For dramatic purposes, this makes sense because it allows for various death traps to be set and keeps the fight scenes exiting. But it also fits into a subtext that perhaps Captain Marvel has too much power, that he is perhaps like genie from a bottle, a quasi-demonic expression of the Id. This Captain Marvel, who gets a little too violent sometimes, and who Billy Batson only reluctantly calls upon, could be considered an early forerunner of the Incredible Hulk.\n\nDespite this Captain's occasional lapses into vigilantism, the overall spirit of this serial keeps within the norms of the era and the genre, and so is great fun and escapism. Moreover, the total experience of this serial truly captures the expansive sense of magic, power and possibility of the early period of comic book superheroes. This is vastly superior to either of the Superman serials (1948 & 1950) as well as the Captain Marvel 'Shazam!' TV series of the 1970's. On an ultra low budget and long before CGI, this serial captured the magic of the comics.",

I do enjoy good movies, both new and old. I was also brought up on the comics. It is sometimes easy to review such a film, sometimes it,s difficult.\n\nThe ADVENTURES of CAPTAIN MARVEL (Republic 1941) represented one occasion where the cart was before the horse. When age of being interested in super hero types in the comics hit me, Fawcett Comics magazines featuring the 'Big Red Cheese' had ceased to being published. Due to long standing litigation brought against Fawcett by Superman/DC Comics,CM's publishers hollered \"Uncle!\", thus giving in to end the dispute.* So,it was with very little familiarity with Whiz Comics,Captain Marvel Adventures,and all the other family of comic magazines that this writer first viewed the serial version. It was hard to be totally objective because every reviewer, be it in SCREEN THRILLS ILLUSTRATED or one of the Horror or Sci-Fi Movie Mags, had nothing but great reviews for CAPTAIN MARVEL.\n\nWell as usual, if one is to give analysis and commentary about an adapted character, the differences or changes must be noted and dealt with.While the serial boys in Hollywood are notorious for tinkering with the story lines,so in this case, they didn't disappoint us.\n\nThey made CM's alter ego,Billy Batson, a teen ager. In the comics he appeared to be about 10, certainly no older. They put him outside the U.S.A.,\"in a remote part of Siam\", in a mysterious Valley of the Tombs. It was here, during an excavation of one tomb, that Billy (Frank Coughlan,Jr., meets up with the spirit of the Wizard, SHAZAM!**, who tells him he is to become Captain Marvel (Tom Tyler).\n\nOn the other hand,as in the comics,Young Billy is still a kid Radio Commentator on Radio Station WHIZ and does so in the serial (chapter 2 and others). The Seral is filled with top action sequences, like all of Republic's.There are great sequences of the good Captain flying, taking off, landing and even administering a sort of savat maneuver to a bad guy.(French Foot Fighting, kind of like a pro wrestler's Drop Kick) All of these fine action scenes were a combination of trick photography,and use of a fine Stunt Man (David Sharpe)doubling for Mr.Tom Tyler.\n\nThe use of a very lifelike dummy was the top rate special effect of the Brothers Lydecker (Howard and Theodore)and was the last ingredient in achieving the flying sequences, as well as the various explosions, volcanic eruptions, fires, etc. Their special effects topped most of those in the 'Big Studios'.(This dummy was later used in KING OF THE ROCKRT MEN and COMMANDO CODY, TV and Serial versions.)\n\nOne may find some of the story line and action a little more brutal than expected for juvenile fair. In particular, when the Malcom Archaeological Expedition is attacked by the tribesmen (led by Reed Hadley), Captain Marvel comes to their aid, using all of his super strength, flying ability,etc., then CM turns one of the attackers own machine guns on them, mowing down a whole line of attackers! In all fairness, any of these criticisms brought forth here are really minor, for the whole serial, chapter by chapter delivers the way it is supposed to.It is unfair to expect any adaptation to be exactly like the comics page it was taken. Besides, we know that it brought the kids back, week after week to see not 'if', but rather 'how' Captain Marvel saves the day.\n\nIt is interesting that the sort of humor that was always such a feature of Captain Marvel that does not make it to the screen. I once was asked by someone to tell them the difference between Superman and Captain Marvel. Well there is the obvious Science(or Science Fiction) vs. Magic. I thought a moment and came up with; \"Captain Marvel is like a cross between Superman and Lil' Abner.\" You may quote me on that. \n\n*In the lawsuit(s) between DC and Fawcett, Captain Marvel's publisher agreed to cease publication of their alleged plagiarism of DC's Superman. After a hiatus of a little over 20 years, DC bought the rights and began publishing Captain Marvel & Family in SHAZAM! Comics.\n\n** In the Origin Comics Story, Billy Batson is led down a dark subway tunnel by a mysterious, dark cloaked man. Eventually he is in the presence of the Great Wizard SHAZAM, who explains o Billy that he has been chosen to be Captain Marvel, and possess the powers of the great heroes and gods whose initials form the acronym SHAZAM, which is also the magic word to effect his change to the adult,Captain Marvel. They also bestow their particular powers to Billy. They are: Solomon (Wisdom),Hercules (Strength),Atlas (Stamina), Zeus (Power), Achilles (Courage), Mercury (Speed!",

Tom Tyler is a very robust Captain Marvel who manages to impress during the action scenes (you watch Victor Mature in 'Samson and Delilah' and the assistance from wires, while lifting bad guys, is pathetically obvious, while Tyler's heavings move on a natural arc), though the voice is a bit uncharacteristic for a superhero.\n\nThe supporting cast is pretty run-of-the-mill, and fills the slots of the character categories that seem obligatory in every serial, but the pacing, the tension, and the conflicts keep the story moving.\n\nDuring this time the issue of superheroes killing bad guys was still evolving as evident here with Captain Marvel, early on, subduing villains who were firing at him with a machine gun, only to turn it on a second wave of them charging at him. Then later we see Captain Marvel gorilla-pressing a thug, then tossing him off the roof of a big skyscraper.\n\nOverall a worthwhile film when it comes to experiencing a cinematic artifact, and enjoying a good story.",

A genuinely interesting storyline (especially for those of us who grew up on comics and/or pulp magazine reprints), augmented by some of the greatest flying effects ever devised (man-made, hands-on fx, courtesy of the Lydecker brothers), makes ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL a fanboy's dream come true. There are, of course, the usual deviations from the source material (inevitable in the transition to The Big Screen), but these can easily be taken in stride. Like the earliest (comic book) version of The Bat-Man, Captain Marvel has no compunction when it comes to killing: he doesn't hesitate to machine-gun fleeing thugs (shooting them in the back) or to toss them from dizzying heights with just a hint of gleeful abandon. Most unnerving of all has to be his almost arrogant sneer as he advances on hapless, would-be killers as their bullets bounce harmlessly off his chest; he advances like an unstoppable automaton, seeming to relish the thought of the destruction he's about to unleash. There are some truly spectacular slow motion stunts (including takeoffs and landings), a brawl in which literally every single prop or piece of furniture in one room is demolished, a molten mountain that has to be seen to be believed, and what are quite simply the coolest flying effects ever conceived. Tom Tyler appears to have been born to play Marvel, and Frank Coghlan, Jr. as Billy Batson would've made a good Marvel, Jr. (his knock-down, drag out fight is another of the many highlights of this serial). In a neat twist in Chapter 8, villains are killed by a fellow villain's deathtrap. In Chapter 9, torture is tastefully handled with shadows cast on a wall (and it's mercifully brief, too). The direction, by William Witney and Joe English, is simply outstanding (as is the writing, handled by a 5-man crew of scribes). No expense was spared and, in so doing, the producers of ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL set the bar impossibly high. Nothing else ever really came close.",

                "text": "In preparing to watch several superhero movies this summer, I finally-after about 30 years of reading and hearing about it-decided to watch the first of the cinema adaptations of a comic book costumed fighter, usually with \"special powers\" as they were then referred as, that appeared at a neighborhood theatre near you: Adventures of Captain Marvel. This 12-chapter serial has it all-thrills, some humor, and plenty of good old fashioned derring do. Tom Tyler-often considered the strongest man of that time-is perfect as The Big Red Cheese (though his costume was actually blue/gray in order to look better in black & white) with his alter ego Billy Batson done in a nice brave and optimistic turn by Frank Coghlan, Jr. And his sidekicks, Betty Wallace (Louise Currie) and Whitey Murphy (William Benedict) also bring their own charm to the proceedings. Now I'm sure some would be disappointed to not see the classic villains like Dr. Silvana or Mr. Mind here but the created-for-the-screen The Scorpion is good enough for this outing especially when he's suspected of being one of the archeology team Billy and his pals accompany to a cave which is, incidentally, where the wizard who gave Batson his powers, Shazam (Nigel De Brulier) resides. By the way, Nigel was supposedly the inspiration for the guy who mentors Mickey Mouse in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" segment of Fantasia. Sure, there are some flaws-like why do the bad guys keep shooting at Cap's chest when they already know bullets won't hurt him-but overall, Adventures of Captain Marvel still provides thrilling entertainment galore (I was especially impressed when that driverless truck provided some POV shots that must have temporarily made some kids dizzy when they watched this at their theatre). And while in some scenes it's obviously a dummy flying, those sequences as created by Howard and Theodore Lydecker would indeed-as a tagline for Superman: The Movie can attest-insinuate \"You Will Believe a Man Can Fly\". Nothing more to say except, a good time should be had by all when watching this. (and while I willingly sat through the whole thing seeing this on the internet with the only break between chap. 6 & 7, some may just want to take a break with each cliffhanger that comes along...)",

                "text": "In this 1941 Republic \"Captain Marvel\" serial, the real-life actor, Gerald Mohr, was the \"voice\" of \"The Scorpion,\" the villain of the piece. Gerald Mohr is given credit only on the \"Full Cast and Crew\" URL .\n\nGerald Mohr, as a screen actor, has his own IMDb \"page.\" Here, Mohr is given credit for being the voice of \"The Scorpion.\" However, the \"The Scorpion\" link here does not refer back to the \"Captain Marvel\" serial at all, but rather to something else, something seemingly very different, something which does not seem to know the 1941 Republic serial.\n\nIn addition, this IMDb \"page\" on Mohr does not know the fine work that Gerald Mohr did in what is now called \"Old Time Radio (OTR),\" during the remainder of the (1941 - 1962) \"run\" of OTR, after Mohr's appearance in this-present 1941 \"Captain Marvel\" serial. Just as one example ( from ca. 1950), of Mohr's presence on OTR : Mohr was the radio voice of \"Philip Marlowe,\" the fictional detective character created by Raymond Chandler. You can find something \"towards\" Mohr's OTR roles in his Wikipedia page.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that the Republic \"Captain Marvel\" serial adumbrated ( and possibly inspired ? ) a technique used decades later in the *STAR WARS* series of feature-length films: The technique of using a face-mask to change the voice of the person behind the mask. The mask is constructed in such a way as to change the voice. Talking through the mask changes the sound of the unmasked voice, so that the one cannot be recognized in or from the other. As an example ( from *STAR WARS* ), recall the scene in the third and final episode of the original *STAR WARS* trilogy, when \"Darth Vader\" is finally unmasked and his helmet is taken off. The man . . . still inside the suit, but now without the helmet . . . has a very different voice from that of the real-life actor James Earl Jones, who was the \"voice\" of \"Darth Vader\" when the character was in full costume.\n\nWhile . . . in *STAR WARS*. . . the voice-changing quality of the face-mask may have been used for effect, nevertheless, in the Republic \"Captain Marvel\" serial, the technique is used for concealment, to hide the real identity of the villain. This has its effect in the episode in which a henchman of \"The Scorpion\" cannot recognize the voice of \"The Scorpion\" in the voices of any of the possible suspects around the conference table in the meeting-room. The mask has the ability to change the natural voice of its wearer beyond all recognition. Thus, the villain cannot be identified --- from his voice alone --- even by his own henchmen. Thus, he cannot be betrayed by any of them.\n\nCould the \"Captain Marvel\" serial have inspired *STAR WARS* in this respect, of using a face-mask so to change the quality of the voice? \n\nIn addition, the ending of the final episode (Chapter 12 ) of the serial has the offending weapon being destroyed by being thrown into a running river of molten lava. Is it just coincidence -- or is it more than coincidence ---- that the Ninth Ring, The Ring of Power, meets its own fate at the end of *THE LORD OF THE RINGS* (*LOTR*) by falling into a running river of molten lava? \n\nI do not give the \"Captain Marvel\" serial a specific number-vote, in the sense that I do not want to get into a discussion of which Republic non-Western serial was the best. I think that all three of \"The Fighting Devil Dogs,\" \"Comando Cody,\" and \"Captain Marvel\" were about equally good. They all did what they were supposed to do : Keep the kids entertained of a Saturday afternoon at the Bijou!",

Whitey is a very good sidekick. Reed Hadley's voice is excellent as always and his acting is very professional. John Davidson is believable and I liked his acting. The henchmen's hats stay on during the fight scenes, just like cowboy westerns, but the actual fights seemed to be staged well. The story was very good; it carried my interest in each chapter. The cliffhangers were probably the best of all serials. They really made you want to see the next one. The music was absolutely wonderful.

Great and interesting Captain Marvel casting with the complete change of the actor's role between the magical change from Billy to Captain Marvel. I always felt that in the 50's Superman TV show, the actor's Clark being the same actor as Superman's was a mistake and they should have done as Captain Marvel folks did with changing the actor completely. Also I found out that the makers of Superman copyright sued and won against the copyright holders of Captain Marvel. It was a battle against Superman was lost and as part of the superman winning settlement was that Capt Marvel took a cash settlement to stop making it's projects. Captain Marvel disappeared from the popular minds. But, Republic Pictures is back and re-releasing their archive of films. The home studio of early John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and other matin\u00e9e serials was in the present CBS Radford studio lot in Studio City, CA. The flying figure on a wire of CM was done and the same as Republic's 50's Commander Cody's rocket pack shows.

                "text": "Any time you have Roy Rogers and George Gabby Hayes on the same screen it will be a winner. Although the story line was similar to some other westerns, it still held enough twists and differences to keep one interested to the end. Roy was great as always. He seems to have a natural born talent for acting and it was probably because he was just being himself - an easy going, decent person of character that good people would follow anywhere. In this picture he was a man who was trying to put his gun handy ways behind him. Of course, the bad guys wouldn't allow that when they pushed him too far. Also starring was the ever wonderful Gabby Hayes as the owner of a traveling medicine show, with Roy as a trick shooter and singer plus the energetic and cute, Sally Payne as a singer and assistant in the show. Gabby was supposed to be her father. You may remember her playing a flamboyant Belle Star in Roy's \"Robin Hood of the Pecos\". Something unusual crossed my mind as I watched this in that the good guys were Roy, Gabby and Sally. Yet they were working towns doing a medicine show, and medicine shows were known for the \"snake oil\" sales of liquids that did nothing for the person but make them drunk or dead. Sally even sold bottles from the wagon and Gabby made the comment he was going to make more if he could find some snake juice. But hey, that's the movies. Now over in town, things were controlled by a group of very bad men including a guy named Ripper played by Hal Taliaferro (aka Wally Wales), Jake Marvel played by Ralf Harolde and Monte Burns played by Jay Novello. Novello is that character actor you have seen so many times playing a little weasel (as in this movie), who also showed great comedy ability playing on I Love Lucy and McHale's Navy to name just a couple. Hal Taliaferro is a name you've seen in numerous movies in a supporting role. Another helper of the bad guys was the sheriff, interestingly played by Monte Blue himself. Most people will remember him as a leading man in the silent movies opposite famous females like the Gish sisters, Gloria Swanson, Clara Bow and Norma Shearer. Roy's love interest was played by Carol Adams whom I am not familiar with. But she reminded me of the girl that plays Elaine on Seinfeld, only Carol Adams had a sweeter, not so hard look about her. One of the stage coach drivers was the greatest stunt man and stunt director of all time, Yakima Canutt. For anyone who wanted western stunts done, including large scale stampedes and fights, they just didn't come any better than Canutt. I'm not going to spoil the movie for you, let's just say it was the battle between good and evil, Roy and certain townsfolk forced to live outside of town vs the bad guys who took away their businesses and murdered friends and family....and Roy was the one man people will always follow to fight the injustices perpetrated by bad guys. As an aside, the head of the bad men was played by Henry Brandon. You may recall him playing the part of the menacing Indian chief Scar, in \"The Searchers\" with John Wayne. Now here is something only a joker like me would notice. In \"Bad Man of Deadwood\", I was surprised by the difference in height when Brandon practically towered over Roy when they met in the newspaper office. Well no wonder, Brandon was 6'5\" tall. Roy looked to be a more normal height of maybe 5'11\" there abouts - don't know for sure. I thought it strange because I remembered in \"The Searchers\", when The Duke and Scar came face to face for the first time, they stared eye to eye level. Looking up The Duke explained it, as he was 6' 4-1/2\" tall. I never realized John Wayne was that tall. As you can see, I don't analyze movies so much as I just enjoy them (or not) for what they are, and am more interested in the tidbits and history of the actors and the film. \"Bad Man of Deadwood\" is well worth watching. The acting was great and the inter-relationships between the actors was well written and also well directed by Joseph Kane. If you like the old style westerns you will like this one. And yet, it went a step beyond the normal western to make for very entertaining viewing.",

I was amused by the name of Roy's character in this one, as he went by Bill Brady, the name of his long time sidekick (Pat Brady) in films and TV for many years. The name Bill Brady is an alias for our hero, his past as Brett Starr is mentioned a couple of times but without too much revelation. It's assumed that he was trying to put a gunman's past behind him.\n\nThe trio have a good rapport as they battle Deadwood town boss Ripper (Hal Taliaferro) and a whole passel of baddies, notably newspaper editor Carver (Henry Brandon), theater owner Marvel (Ralf Harolde) and henchman Monte Burns (Jay Novello). Novello's character is unbelievable - he's everywhere! Every time you turn around, Burns is there, spying on the good guys, in the Judge's house, hanging out with Marvel, and mixing it up with Brady. It's too bad he didn't make it to the end of the picture.\n\nRoy's romantic interest in this one is played by Carol Adams, and it was kind of hard to warm up to her character because she never smiled. She was pretty enough, but it never came through her serious demeanor. It made me wonder why Roy took such a fancy to her, ready to drop his adventurous ways with the medicine show to settle down at the drop of a hat.\n\nFor his part, Roy shows some unusual athletic ability in a couple of running side mounts over a pretty tall fence while chasing a bad guy. At the same time though, there are a couple of credibility defying scenes where he escapes a large group of town folk when they think he's the bad guy, and when he's cornered by outlaws who think he's a good guy. It doesn't say much for the story writing at the time, when these oaters were churned out at a rapid clip to capitalize on the lead actor's ability to draw an audience.\n\nStill, this is a pretty enjoyable little flick that breezes by, as most of Roy's flicks do, in just about an hour. Gabby's fully whiskered in this one, but unusually well groomed too - you'll get a kick out of seeing him in a gentleman's jacket, top hat and walking stick after coming into a large inheritance!",

Given that the story is adapted from a work by Alphonse Daudet there are no surprises but lots to savour like uncredited fine work by Jean Tissier and Robert Le Vigan but genuine French film buffs should be prepared to roll over and play dead when the great Arletty turns up in the late stages and steals the whole thing effortlessly with one hand tied behind her back.",

                "text": "The 1939 Paramount version of Hotel Imperial is an enjoyable film, but a flawed one. \n\nIts greatest virtue is its atmosphere. You really feel you are in a little town in Eastern Europe during WW I, as the Russians and Austrians battle for possession of it. The limited battle scenes, the narrow streets, the muddy roads in the rain, the dark night scenes, the scenes in the inn (complete with Russians singing and dancing), are all very well-filmed. \n\nThe story is interesting: A woman whose sister committed suicide -- by delicate implication due to her sexual mistreatment by an unknown Austrian officer -- seeks revenge on the perpetrator and sticks around the Hotel (despite the risk of the imminent capture of the town by the Russians, with the likelihood of her own imprisonment or death) to find out who the cad was. I won't say what happens, as it would spoil the plot, but there are two or three twists or turns in her quest.\n\nI don't think the final screenplay did justice to the plot, and so the execution of the film doesn't live up to the promise. I don't mean the story is incoherent; the events unfold quite logically; but it is not nearly as surprising or suspenseful or emotionally powerful story as it could have been, with more focused writing that was not in such a hurry to establish a romance and stuck more to developing the main plot ideas. (I believe this film had difficulties in production, with stars and directors in and out until the last minute, and that is probably why it ended up with a screenplay that was less than polished.)\n\nDirector Robert Florey had done one or two horror films for Universal; perhaps that is why the small-village Eastern European setting is so well done! Ray Milland is reasonably good as the Austrian officer, though I think the slightly stiff script cramps him. Isa Miranda, who appears to be offered as a Greta Garbo clone in the film, is good, and very attractive, and even does a musical number for the Russian officers. However, again the weak script makes her less effective than she should be; her romance with Milland isn't really built up to properly, and the emotional darkness of her quest for vengeance isn't played up enough in the writing, so she doesn't get a chance to shine as a serious dramatic actress (as opposed to a light romantic lead). Gene Lockhart is, as always, good in his humorous character-actor part. J. Carrol Naish is good in his non-humorous role as well, though again, an anemic script doesn't give him a chance to show his full range as an actor.\n\nThe main problem with this film, other than the weak script, is that it doesn't seem sure whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama. A drama can of course have lighter moments; they help to set off the serious parts. But there is fair bit of clownery with Lockhart and his assistant at the hotel, and the Russian general, a central character, is played largely for laughs (reminiscent of the father of the princess in Korda's Thief of Bagdad). Thus, there is a clash between the dark character of the basic plot (a tale of a woman's vengeance on a morally debased officer that she can't yet identify), and the generally grim wartime goings-on (Austrian prisoners being shot by the Russians and so on), and the attempt make several of the characters lovable buffoons. The movie lacks a consistency of mood and tone.\n\nI certainly enjoyed watching the film, and probably will watch it again, to enjoy certain moments; but it remains stuck between the A-film aspirations of the plot and a B-film formulaic execution. The current rating of the film on the IMDb is 7.1 out of 10, and I have to admit that it doesn't deserve much higher than that. For photography, sets, and atmosphere, maybe an 8 would be justified, but in all other respects the film is a B-minus effort. \n\nI add that while the IMDb and Leonard Maltin both list this film as 67 minutes -- a short length which would not be likely for a Paramount film of this type in 1939 -- it was in fact originally longer, and a nearly 80-minute version exists (Loving the Classics); my review here is based on that version. (If any shorter, 67-minute version actually exists, it would only exacerbate the problems of the longer version, since even at 80 minutes the story suffers from underdevelopment. Cutting out major scenes would add discontinuity to script weakness. So if you can, get the 80-minute version. And no, I'm not working for the vendor; I just hate shortened versions of films and like to let people know when fuller versions exist.)",

                "text": "I am surprised that I write the first review for Hotel Imperial. This movie is a little gem, and should be officially released in DVD by Universal, after proper restoration. Today only a DVD release by Loving the Classics is available, but only a real remastering by Universal could take away the dust and let its sparkle come to the surface. \n\nThis is one of those few movies that combine social satire, adventure and romance in a unique way... During World War I, a little Austrian town is conquered alternatively by Russian and Austrian troops, so that its inhabitants no longer know who is to govern them tomorrow and they finally learn to live with this. The \"Hotel Imperial\" is a sort of headquarters for the masters of the day, with its whole clientele departing in a hurry one day, only to be replaced by a new one, but in different uniforms, shortly after.\n\nIsa Miranda plays Anna, a theater singer from Poland, who disguises as the hotel's chambermaid, in order to find the Austrian officer who was the cause for her little sister's suicide. Her humble clothes, however, cannot conceal her striking beauty nor her strong personality, determined as she is for revenge. Young Austrial lieutenant Nemassy, (Ray Milland, heavenly handsome in his Hussar's uniform!), falls for her, and their adventures begin.... We have two genuinely hilarious characters in the hotel's porter and the hotel's general duties clerk (Gene Lockhart and Curt Bois respectively), whose roles are very cleverly written. Also the eccentric Russian general Videnko, marvelously played by Reginald Owen and the corrupt Austrian officer and spy Kuprin (Carrol Naish), among various other characters. I should not forget to mention the excellent Russian male choir, that sing Christmas songs and the dancers who perform traditional Russian dances and are really a treat. Hotel Imperial is very expertly directed by R. Florey who leads us, at a pace that never slacks, to the well deserved happy end. What I like most in this movie is the ambiance, this feeling of constant change and constant danger, and how the human nature reacts, adjusts to this and tries to survive and make the most of it. \n\nHotel Imperial is a delightful movie and should not be missed by anyone who loves the romantic and the adventurous, with a touch of satire on the side.",

To the town comes Ann Warschaska, intent on avenging the suicide of her sister, who has killed herself after being betrayed by an Austrian officer. She knows no more about his identity than the number of his room at the \"Hotel Imperial\". She gets a job at the hotel as a maid but soon combines this work with modeling, when an eccentric Russian, General Videnko, with a passion for painting asks her to pose for him. Breaking into the fatal Room 12, she finds Lt. Nemassey, a young Austrian officer who has taken refuge there after being separated from the army. Thinking him the betrayer of her sister, she plans to hand him over to the occupying-Russians, but relents when she learns that there are two Room 12's. The man actually guilty of the crime is a Russian spy who holds a commission in the Austrian army. Believing him to be a fellow-soldier in distress, Nenassey makes plans to help him escape, but finds out at the last minute that he is a Russian spy. A strange turn events allows Nenassey to aid Anna in her mission and rid his country of a dangerous enemy at the same time. General Videnko, meanwhile, is giving a grand-style banquet for the man who will never be able to attend another."

What starts out to be a rather predictable wartime \"B\" light comedy, emerges shortly as a full-blown screwball comedy of the most delightful sort. Ida Lupino, of all people,shows that she can do comedy as well as Carol Lombard. After her years at Columbia, Warner Brothers finally discovered her broad acting talent. (Would that Columbia and MGM had discovered the comedic abilities of Lucille Ball decades earlier.) This low-budget gem, based on a play, reveals quite a bit about wartime America's economy and socio-economic structure. But mostly it's about a romantic entanglement and mistaken identity, two much-used devices that need first rate acting to pull off. Here, it happens. Even Sidney Greenstreet manages his atypical role in an impressive way. I don't know why the producers decided to insert a meaningless nightclub scene featuring two minutes of Louis Armstrong \"and his orchestra,\" but perhaps this was just a way to attract more viewers. By the way, this is one of Willy Best's best films. He was finally given something to do in a movie that didn't involve Charlie Chan. Paul Harvey and William Prince also handled their roles admirably. In short, this is a long- forgotten winner.",

Jean (Lupino) finagles an army officer (Prince) to pose as her husband so she can get restricted housing in a motel court. Naturally, \"who sleeps where\" type complications ensue as they work to keep up appearances. The pace picks up as the difficulties mount, ending finally in madcap farce.\n\nThe cast tries hard to make familiar material for the time work. Still, seams do show, especially with Lupino's sometimes over-eager performance. Clearly, she's anxious to show she's as good at comedy as she is at dramatics. Then too, when movie buffs think Greenstreet, comedy doesn't come to mind. But here he plays an unlikely over-weight colonel to pretty good effect. (Note how the script deals with this fudging of army fitness standards.) \n\nThe colorful mix of supporting characters includes a mischievous little Robert Blake, a busybody Ruth Donnelly, a bug-eyed Willy Best, and an addled Stuart Erwin. Together, they manage to keep the chuckles coming. The movie, however, doesn't rise to the first rank, perhaps because the elements don't blend into a seamless whole\u0097you can almost see the characters and situations being assembled. Nonetheless, it's a generally entertaining glimpse into what titillated audiences coming out of the big war.",

Of course misunderstandings abound.\n\nIda is charming and adept at comedy, William Prince is fine but it's a shame that since she rarely did comedy she didn't have a chance to costar with one of the master of the form like Cary Grant or Clark Gable.

As it was during WWII, women were assuming many jobs held by men and Ida does this to help out with the war effort. However, she turns out to be pretty bad at sales and by the time she gets to one remote location, she's desperate. But things only get worse, as there is a military base nearby and so there are no spare hotel rooms. On a lark, she checks into a motel designated for spouses of servicemen. However, she's single and lies to get the room--and unless she wants to get tossed out, she'll have to find some guy to pose as her husband. The unsuspecting shmoe is a young lieutenant (William Prince)--whose nice gesture completely blows up in his face. And now, they are stuck together--otherwise the Lieutenant will be in serious trouble with his Colonel. Can all this be straightened out and Lupino and Prince avoid serious consequences? \n\nThis is a nice screwy comedy that was pretty timely--as there was a severe housing shorting during the war. In many ways, the theme is reminiscent of the wonderful comedy \"The More the Merrier\"--though this latter film is much more of a classic. \"Pillow to Post\", on the other hand, is rather slight...enjoyable but slight.\n\nsnafu",

All of Hollywood's top female dramatic stars did a comedy at some point in their career, and this was Lupino's turn. It's another World War II crowded conditions comedy, and like \"The Doughgirls\", this features a woman scheming to pretend to be married just so she can get a room. Ida's a business woman near San Diego who desperately tries to find a lieutenant to be her husband, and a ton of complications occur. \n\nThe unlucky lieutenant she grabs onto is William Prince, and he is unaware that his commanding officer (Sydney Greenstreet) lives in the auto court run by acerbic Ruth Donnelly. Barbara Brown adds a few giggles as Greenstreet's squeaky voiced dimwit wife who interferes in the \"newleywed's\" business. More laughs are added by Willie Best as \" Lucille\" the handyman. He actually gets to say, \"I never forget a face, especially when I sat on it!\", although with total innocence. Louis Armstrong appears to entertain the troops with an unknown Dorothy Dandridge. \n\nWhile Lupino had played some lighter parts earlier in career, by this time, she was one of Warner Brother's top drama stars, but if Davis, De Havilland and Stanwyck could do comedy, then Ida could do it as well. Ironically, other than a brief musical appearance in \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" before this, she never varied from drama again. However, for a rare foray into comedy, she seems pretty comfortable and manages to enjoy herself. Not quite worthy of a \"Garbo laughs!\" slogan, she's nevertheless a lot of fun.",

Ida is attractively photographed and costumed, but is otherwise sadly wasted. Fortunately, the first half of the film is brisker and more lively than the second half. In fact, in the last 30 minutes or so, the screenwriters give up their attempts to open up the stage play, and are content to let the play's over-verbose dialogue take over. Greenstreet struggles vainly to make something of his role, but without good material to work with, he flounders helplessly. And alas, Louis Armstrong and his orchestra (with vocalist, Dorothy Dandridge) are but briefly glimpsed during a night club interlude. To cap it all off, production values are very moderate and Vincent Sherman's direction totally lifeless and uninteresting.",

Her reactions aren't varied enough, she almost always seems to be on the verge of tears and simply doesn't seem to be having much fun.

There's much more bad about it than what's good about it. I don't care for the \"exotic\"  Arabian locales, I like my westerns to be set in the American west. Seeing William Boyd  dressed in Arabic robes made him seem somewhat ridiculous! I prefer Hoppy in his all- black outfit (translation= \"ready to take care of business\"), but here he wore a gray shirt  with black pants & hat, then got into the robes, & that just doesn't do it for me! Here are  the positive points of this film: it starts out in Gila-Bend, which is nice; Hoppy identifies  himself as a \"county Deputy Sheriff\"; California gets to ride Topper for a few minutes  while Hoppy is breaking in a horse. That's it, even the comedy from California is weak.  On the negative side, we have: the clothes issue (above), the absurdity of traveling to  Arabia with Topper in tow (& I assume his side-kicks' horses as well), the very slow  pace, the unexciting action sequences (3 gunfights, but apparently no one is even so  much as wounded in any of them), the song by Brad King (although he's far from the  worst of Hoppy's young sidekicks, see Jay Kirby & Jimmy Rogers for that \"honor\"), & the  miscasting of Duncan Renaldo (TV's \"Cisco Kid,\" who I like a lot) as an Arabic Sheik  (whose Spanish accent creeps through at times, although he was \"educated in\n\nEngland\"!). There's really not much to recommend here. As of this writing, imdb voters  gave it a 7+ rating, which makes it one of the higher rated Hoppy movies. That's hard to  believe, because there's 65 other Hoppy movies out there that are better than this one!  This is the only film of Hoppy's that I'd rate below a 5/10, & I give it a 3/10.",

The story is simple enough. A doctor about to die is saved by an evil spirit in the guise of a mysterious woman, but as we know, there is always a price to pay for undeserved immortality.\n\nThis was, without question, a \"B\" movie dressed up to be more stylistic than most. As in those Val Lewton movies, all the performances are understated. The principals drift into indecipherable monologues that leave you numb. Many of the scenes are shot in shadow and the whole atmosphere is spooky. There is no bloody violence to speak of, but there is enough heart stopping shock to satisfy the blood-lust in most of us.\n\nGeorge MacReady leads the cast. This should tell us something. He was a fine character actor, but only in a low budget thriller would he ever be given the lead. His evil muse is played by Rose Hobart. I have to admit I never heard of her until I saw this movie, but she did a more than adequate job. In fact, she was downright frightening. The rest of the cast is nameless, although I may have seen one or two of them in an old Dragnet episode, but not one of them let the story down.\n\nThis production is well worth watching - if you can find it. My only complaint is that it comes with a prologue and an epilogue. In fact, it comes with a testament to good over evil. I don't know, it was made in 1944. Maybe they had no choice.",

His wife, played by a solid Jeanne Bates, wishes at the family fireplace for any force from heaven or hell to save him as she has lost faith with her god. Her wish is instantly granted by an unseen Satan as Rose Hobart plays a sort of 'Soul Master' who coldly arrives on the scene and saves Macready. Her action, of course, has a price.\n\nWithout revealing too much, this seems to have tried to copy the Val Lewton formula, which was popular at the time. The film opens and closes with a narrative quote. The direction is adequate. There is a long \"chase\" scene in the middle that seems to go on forever. The two characters walk as if elderly people on prozac. It is meant to be suspenseful, but it's just too darned long to keep up the suspense.\n\nThe film has very few \"horror\" moments, but some nice cinematic ones. There are shadows aplenty, but the best touch is the arrival and departure of Rose Hobart's character. The film changes to a negative image and then back to positive. I hadn't seen that technique used before in a classic horror film and there were some effective dutch angles that did a good job of building the suspense.\n\nA decent film that unfortunately is just never too interesting, it's worth viewing for hard core classic horror buffs only. 5/10",

Rose walks some more. Bland co-lead Jim Bannon even goes for a stroll. In fact, there's so much shoe leather burned in this film that I humbly offer Sole of a Monster as a more suitable title. It's all shot well by Burnett Guffey, and there IS a modicum of Lewton-style atmosphere, but the stifling straitjacket of Christian spirituality (not to mention the cheat ending) ultimately undoes whatever good work went into this production.

Admittedly, it's very preachy and didactic with a load of pretentious spiritual dialogue, but it's far more advanced than any of the \"Monsters jumping out at you\" brand of horror that most studios were doing in the 40's. George Macready (always great) is a dying surgeon whose wife pleads with the forces of darkness, or any forces, to save him. Enter Rose Hobart, a mysterious woman who somehow brings him back from death's door. But Macready is now a changed man: moody, vicious, mean, distracted. He eventually leaves his wife and goes to live with Hobart. His friends try to save him, but he nearly kills one of them, then allows another to die when he could easily have saved him. This is all shot in a dreamlike style that takes place in a nightmarish night-world where every action seems to be a choice between life and death, every thought is about salvation and damnation. It's not perfect, but it's very unusual and very worth catching. Wish it were out on DVD.",

The dreamlike atmosphere and effective almost noir like cinematography are some of that legendary producer's trademarks that are present here. And while this isn't nowhere near as good as \"Cat People\" or \"I Walked With a Zombie\", its still an interesting if deeply flawed film. The otherworldly atmosphere is what makes the film work ultimately. It almost prefigures the cult classic \"Dementia\" at moments. However, the film is brought down by being both pretentious and preachy. There's a religious message here thats sappy and clich\u00e9, even if you are of the faith.\n\nOn a technical scale, the film is pretty uneven. The direction by Will Jason is decent, but the movie drags a bit too often. Far superior is the cinematography by Burnett Guffey. Guffey is what ultimately makes the film worth watching and lends a whole lot of atmosphere to the proceedings. The acting is hit and miss as well. George Macready and Rose Hobart both make effectively hiss worthy villains. However, the protagonists don't fare as well. Jim Bannon is wooden and uninteresting and Jeanne Bates, while a beautiful woman no doubt, is far too over-the-top and histrionic. Both of them get rather annoying after a while. Still, this is an interesting and unique film thats worth checking out if it turns up on television. (6/10)",

                "text": "\"The Soul of a Monster\" cinematically is a treat in following the Val Lewton style of story telling and photography, which it does so well that this could almost be mistaken for a toned down Val Lewton production.\n\nMacready, a renown doctor, is dying, and his wife offers a prayer to the dark force that he live. The story follows through on this premise, with the good doctor living on soulessly and changing into an inhuman person under the tutelage of a devil's assistant, played by Rose Hobart. However, there is a fight for his soul, in which the doctor must participate before the matter is resolved.\n\nBecause of this supernatural element involving the devil, the story is classified as \"horror\", but it's also religious in nature. There is no attempt to scare anyone or show anything horrific or horrible. There are no exorcisms, no fangs, no stakes and no grotesque monsters. Instead, there is a battle for a man's soul. Therefore the movie has a central religious message. This will not be what a good many people in the modern audience expects. It needs to be approached with sympathy for its merits, just as one must do the same for modern films.\n\nJudged on its own turf, this is not a bad little movie, It's unpretentious. The script attempts quite a lot for a one hour b-movie. The Lewton movies are far more in the horror vein, in providing mystery, chills, thrills, fear and suspense. This one is fairly tame by that standard, yet it's not bad. It has its moments that are quite eerie. I'm glad it was made, and I'm very glad to see it in such a beautiful print.

                "text": "What little reputation this film has is very mixed, so it is no surprise my own reaction proved likewise. Revolving around an intriguing concept, yet the script (by genre regular Edward Dein) is seemingly at a loss about what to do with it: an eminent and much beloved physician (George Macready) lies dying and, in desperation at the unfairness of it all, his wife (lovely Jeanne Bates \u0096 who, late in life, somehow got to appear in two David Lynch movies!) renounces God and asks the Devil for help; immediately afterwards, a mysterious woman (Rose Hobart \u0096 from the 1931 DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE) turns up, restores Macready to health and basically starts running his life. While happy to see her husband get better, Bates soon notices that his personality has changed \u0096 becoming distant, aggressive and even loses interest in his work: in short, alienating everyone around him \u0096 so that she actually wishes he had died back then! All of this sends her running into the arms of Macready's best friend, Erik Rolf (looking like a cross between Glenn Ford and the young Orson Welles...or, for that matter a local film-buff friend of mine, Robert!!): his character and relationship to the couple is pretty ambiguous \u0096 he acts almost as their spiritual adviser (thus being instantly and openly averse to Hobart's machinations), yet is a constant presence even at social engagements, hardly deigning to keep the 'love triangle' situation in check! Anyway, Macready's negligence costs a colleague's life and the once-respected doctor is put on trial\u0085only this takes us back to the very beginning, so that all that went on in the interim turns out to have been nothing more than a death-bed hallucination \u0096 the moral being that one must face up to death with dignity and resignation, apparently after having done one's bit for the good of mankind (which should have especially resonated with wartime audiences)! The film offers more than adequate atmosphere (courtesy of future double Oscar-winning cinematographer Burnett Guffey) and Hobart (with an icy demeanor and a devilish coiffure to boot) is quite good \u0096 the combination of which leads to its eeriest moment, the very first appearance of the Devil's envoy in which she is unperturbed by a car running her over and then, after following her in a tilted camera angle shot, no less, she is seen literally electrifying her surroundings! However, as I said at the start, the plot is insufficient as Macready is not seen doing much of anything after he is revived (what was the point, then?) and Hobart actually has to prod him towards committing murder (naturally because it constitutes the extremity of an evil deed)! That said, the choice of target (the 'pastor'/rival) would benefit each of them \u0096 only he flubs it and, so does the film, since this clearly Lewtonesque sequence is kept on going much longer than necessary!; consequently, the inherent suspense in having the 'sleepwalking' Macready (armed with an ice pick long before BASIC INSTINCT [1992]!!) stalk Rolf by night out on the streets is gradually diffused\u0085particularly with the unintentionally comic off-screen effect of the sudden opening of a rising street elevator's hatch sounding like Macready had bumped into some dustbin or a mailbox around the corner! Mind you, I am glad I acquired the film also because, as it happens, this viewing actually urged me to get back to work on my unfinished review of the slightly similar but far superior ALIAS NICK BEAL (1949; which I had originally watched on my birthday back in August) \u0096 in which Macready now actually (and atypically) takes on the role of the Minister Of God who strikes fear into (and eventually brings down) the Agent Of Hell.",

Infected by an incurable disease, from one of the patients that he saved, George is now in the hands of the Almighty waiting for his final curtain call.

Not the kind and caring saint that he was before he fell into the deadly coma that's slowly taking his life away from him. It turns out that Ann summoned this \"Evil Spirit\" in the form of Lilyan Gregg, Rose Hobart, who despite giving her husband back his life forgot, on purpose of course, to give him his soul back with it. \n\nNow fully recovered and in excellent health George was not exactly the person that his friends family and patients knew him as. Stuck up and irritable as well as rude to everyone, including his loving wife Ann, he came in contact with it's obvious that George just isn't himself. It's George's best friend Fred Stevens, Eric Rolf, who soon sees the metamorphose that he went through and in an effort to save George's soul tries to get the poor and confused man help. It's then that Lilyan trying to keep George under her evil control turns George,like a guided missile, on Fred only to be stymied when Fred who happened to find a crucifix, lying there in front of him on the sidewalk, in just the nick of time to stop the crazed and icepick waving George in his tracks.\n\nIt soon become a struggle between George who's Godly goodness, despite him having no soul, is slowly getting the upper hand over the evil Lilyan.

It's this way that Lilyan can have George by being sent to the place where the sun don't shine, and where it's hot as blazes all the time, all for herself for eternity.\n\n*****MAJOR SPOILERS****The surprise ending is a bit uneven in that it left you up in the air to just what exactly it's trying to tell you. Not in George's mental state but in the condition he finds himself in as the movie ends. Still \"Soul of a Monster\" is by far one of the best, as well as one of the most unknown, movies about the struggle between \"Good\" and \"Evil\" ever to come out of Hollywood. The film is surprisingly nowhere as corny or predictable as you would have imagined, before you saw it knowing it's storyline, it to be and that by far is the biggest surprise, together with the surprise ending, in the movie.",

Unfortunately, despite a great premise and an excellent start, the movie was undone by lousy and very heavy-handed script writing.\n\nGeorge Macready played a saintly doctor was on his deathbed. His distraught wife is angry that such a good and selfless man should die so young and she rejects assurances and platitudes from a friend that he's \"going on to a better place\". And, in a weak moment, she announces that she wants her husband well and could care less who could help--be it Heaven or Hell. Well, not unexpectedly, he DID recover--thanks to a strange woman who appears and magically heals him. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, she turns out to be evil (though exactly WHO she is working for is never revealed) and she is able to control Macready with her evil mind!!! Now all this seemed great except for two problems. Despite her voice appearing in his head with instructions to kill, Macready never really got around to doing that much evil--and he never did icepick victims like the voice commanded. However, much worse was the ultra-heavy-handed moralizing that accompanied this. It seemed like all the fun was missing from the script and it was just a very preachy message about good versus evil--and not in a good way. It was almost like combining \"Davey and Goliath\" with a 1940s horror film--with much more emphasis on the Davey and Goliath aspects. It was embarrassing bad--so bad I nearly turned off the film. \n\nA low budget does NOT mean that a film must be dull or poorly constructed. Don't let this film turn you off the genre!\n\nAlso, I read through the mostly VERY favorable reviews for this film and this left me baffled. Sure, I could understand a person liking this film (we all have different tastes), but to say this small film deserves a rating of 9 or 10 is madness! Even the truly great films like THE BLACK CAT, THE MUMMY and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN have many reviews that were scored much lower than this!!! The overall IMDb score of 4.9 would NOT indicate that this is a 9 or 10. Such super-high scores should be reserved for only the great films--not run of the mill \"cheapie\" films like this.",

She calls on the dark powers to save him. A rather severe and intimidating women appears out of nowhere to save his life.

It's him as the noble and saintly Dr Winston that I just can't picture.\n\nSoul of a Monster has a bit of the Devil and Daniel Webster and Cat People and even a bit of Frankenstein written into it's story.As I said Rose Hobart stands out and its her performance that makes the picture worth viewing. Erik Rolf plays Fred Stevens a family friend who is the conscience of the film. He is the Christian voice in the movie. Rolf always reminded me of Nils Asther. Soul of a Monster is really trying to sermonize about keeping faith in God and not losing morality in times of stress. It's not a terrible film but it ain't great either.",

He cracks the first open into a hot skillet with no problem. But when he starts to break open the second shell, a fully-formed chick plops directly into the cooking pan, immediately running around in circles, shrieking, \"What are you trying to do--give me a hot-foot?!\" Before the carnage gets too bad, this chick runs back under Mom, hunkering down for safety (after emerging briefly to display a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign).",

Daffy, his assistant, tries to get a customer a hamburger but the mice ate it leaving this note: \"Greetings Gate, you're a wee bit late.\" (The first two words were Jerry Colonna's to Bob Hope on his radio show) Also, one of the eggs that Porky gets out of a mother hen, spouts a chick that complains about a \"hot foot\" when he cracks out on a frying pan before going back to his mom! When Daffy spots a cow as potential burger, he chases him to a barn but then gets stuck with a bull that causes havoc to the leads for the rest of the cartoon. Perhaps not hilarious like other Clampett cartoons but amusing enough for me to recommend to any Warner cartoon completists out there. And dig the musical number in the beginning!",

Frances Marion, the screen writer, was famous in the silent era, but when the talkies came in, her scripts had to be re-written by others for dialog. She simply had no talent at all for that; her mastery was in plot and action.\n\nWhale was coming off of 'The Man in the Iron Mask' which made lots of money for its producer, and Whale's agent told him that if he made 'Green Hell' it would put him back in the limelight.\n\nThe budget was good enough, $685,000, and he had a reasonable thirty-six days to complete it. He had the help of Karl Freund and Ted Kent, his long time favorite editor, and one of his favorite assistant directors, Joe McDonough.\n\nThe ambient temperature was screamingly high that summer; Freund's large bank of carbon arc lights didn't help. The problem with the film was the script. The dialog was worse than inane, audiences were falling out of their seats, laughing.\n\nI think Whale may have been bipolar. He had periods of manic activity, interspersed with complete disinterest in what he was doing. He was a director who was not afraid of demanding re-writes, and he did have a talent for judging scripts. He must have known that he was attempting to turn a color-by-the-numbers canvas into a work by Picasso, but when Ted Kent approached him about the script, Whale, according to James Curtis, Whales biographer, said merely that it was \"very good. Great.\"\n\nFrancis Marion wanted her name taken off the credits. But she wrote the script, and very little had been done to change. Her credit remained, and it was the last script she ever sold.\n\nThe reviews were terrible. In his memoirs, Douglas Fairbanks doesn't so much as mention the film. Famous Productions had lasted for the length of this one movie, the company failed before the film was released. Harry Edington, according to Curtis, \"took a job as production chief at RKO.\"",

The fun thing to do with this film, is that knowing that director James Whale was gay, is to look at the characters in another light.

When you see South American natives that look and sound like they came right off the farm in Kansas, it's tough to take the movie seriously! The sets were pretty hokey, too, and the dialog was really corny.\n\nThis was another movie that started off strong and the quickly became horrible and stayed that way.",

Really, the appeal of competence fades in the light of earnestness. As soon as it appeared, the participants realized it was a disaster, but you rarely know that when you are making the thing. It had name talent and a reasonable budget. The narrative stance has no irony or folds. It was intended to hit straight on, and even if the arrow did not score, it was shot with the intent to kill. And that matters.\n\n\u0097 The film world had long since developed a shorthand for black sexual malevolence by depicting the risky jungle. Two touchstones were \"Kongo\" and \"King Kong\" both of which exploited the (then) visceral fear from racism. The same is attempted here, but I do not believe that any of the natives are played by blacks. The effect is startling, a now comic understanding of how transference occurs. You have the deep seated fear of sexual arousal out of control in the American populace. Deep, and strong. That gets transferred to an innocent people, only recently by the time of this film. That in turn gets denoted in unambiguous ways by the jungle and jungle people in film. At each step, there is a trailing disconnect, so that by the time you get to this film, the people in the jungle do not have to remotely look native. (It is not Africa, but that is irrelevant.)\n\n\u0097 the script has all the elements. Sexual betrayal. Sexual competition (separately). Ancient magic attached to gold. Sexual imagery with phallic structures and blasting through walls to release floods. All the competitors (stereotypes) locked in a small space fighting the inevitability of death. It doesn't work, like \"Kongo\" does. But there sure as heck are all the parts.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

He and another man Frank Vincent were partners in a talent agency and according to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in his memoirs, Eddington had always wanted to be a producer. He was well liked by his clients and the cast members he assembled were from mostly his free lance clients who did a favor for him. He got Frances Marion to write the script and James Whale to direct and sold the whole business to Universal.\n\nOther than some establishing shots the entire thing was done on the sound stage of Universal. It all looks phony, even the King Kong jungle at RKO was better than this. Of course American movie companies were not shooting abroad in tropical climates at this time. Fairbanks remembers that while the sets were all phony, the humidity due to lack of air conditioning wasn't.\n\nThe story is set in South America at the Amazon headwaters where one of those movie lost cities has been found. Rumors of Inca treasure has brought a motley concoction of adventurers on an expedition headed by archaeologists Alan Hale and ramrodded by Fairbanks. Vincent Price is part of the group, but he's killed off before a third of the film is done. But when the native porters bring back medicine to help him possibly survive poison arrows, they also bring back his wife, now his widow Joan Bennett.\n\nAnd Joan is dressing pretty chic for jungle travel, she's got all the guys panting after her. But when those headhunters who killed off Price come back, it's starting to look more like the Alamo.\n\nGreen Hell is a curious concoction that's part Trader Horn, part Rain, a little of the Alamo and a little of John Ford's Lost Patrol. Vincent Price as well as Fairbanks used to cheerfully make fun of this film. \n\nWhat some people won't do for a friend.",

Preparing to set off,Brandon is asked by David Richardson if he can join in his search.Warning Richardson that they could be away for at least a year,Brandon sees Richardson display a real determination, which leads to him being invited to join all of the other guys on the mission.As the months start to pass,the group start to break into factions when Richardson's wife Stephanie decides to join them.\n\nView on the film:\n\nGiven a big budget by Universal after The Man in the Iron Mask proved to be a smash hit, (with Universal spending so much on the sets for this movie,that they ended up re-using the sets for years after in order to make up for the box office results!)directing auteur James Whale & cinematographer Karl Freund stylishly place objects around the corner of the screen to give the jungle a real depth of field.Following each footstep in the jungle,Whale and Freund scan the title with gliding tracking shots which basks the heat from the jungle midst onto the audience.Keeping the gang solely consisting of men,Whale smartly uses the arrival of Stephanie Richardson to continue one of his major themes,as each of the explorers tidy's themselves up,and try to hide their original class.\n\nWhilst she was never truly comfortable writing for the \"talkies\",the screenplay by Frances Marion (and an uncredited Harry Hervey) keeps the film moving at a quick pace,thanks to offering a smooth mix of tense Adventure and downcast Melodrama.Although the decision to keep them apart on screen is rather strange,the writers give the Richard's a real sense of longing for each other,whilst trying to get to grips with their haunted memories.Sending the group out into the jungle,the writers offer a delightful mix of quirky character highlights (\"Home on the range!\") with gripping action scenes,as the group get a less than warm welcome.\n\nDespite not being happy with his performance in the movie,Vincent Price actually does very well at showing David Richardson's never truly fitting in with the rest of the adventurers.Joining Price, Joan Bennett smoothly dips the film into moody Melodrama as Stephanie Richardson,whilst George Sanders delivers some heart warming charm,as they all prepare to enter the green hell.",

His story is preposterous but told in such an entertaining manner that the story hardly matters. All you need to do is grab a bag of popcorn, sit back and enjoy an early variation of what audiences in 1981 got a kick out of with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". O.K., so there aren't any Nazi's for Douglas Fairbanks Jr. to chase in the jungles of South America, but there are plenty of arrow-flinging head hunters as well as a tomb filled with golden artifacts, leading to an adventure-filled flick that may not have done its director any good (considering his horror masterpieces such as \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Old Dark House\", as well as the marvelous 1936 movie version of the musical \"Show Boat\"), but remains marvelous entertainment.\n\nJoan Bennett enters the scene about a third into the film after her husband (a non-villainous Vincent Price) becomes the first victim of a head-hunter's arrow. Much like Deborah Kerr in \"King Solomon's Mines\", she brings romance into the story, distracting Fairbanks from chasing the film's one villain (Francis McDonald) and leading to an obvious conclusion. George Sanders is profound as another member of the team who faces death with dignity as the natives approach their fortress, and Alan Hale (Sr.) is the wise doctor amongst the group. Hundreds of extras in native costume fill out the population of guides and head-hunting natives. Considering that he appeared in practically every other Universal film of this nature, it is surprising that Andy Devine wasn't cast here to provide comic relief. The one acting embarrassment is John Howard as a cowardly member of the team. While Bennett is gorgeous in her new Hedy Lamarr make-over, her character here is not as memorable, being rather lady too lady-like and not at all like those vixens she would begin playing a few years later in a series of memorable melodramas and film noir.",

Green Hell doesn't look that lavish and the sets are rather hokey. The dialogue is unbearably corny and the story is full of predictability, a complete lack of credibility(I agree about people sounding too much like they come from Kansas) and contrived situations. James Whale's direction seems disengaged and does little to make anything exciting or thrilling, the two main things that a jungle adventure does need. The acting looks great on paper, but most take their roles too seriously(Douglas Fairbanks Jnr, Joan Bennett) or try hard but are not in the movie anywhere near long enough(George Sanders, Vincent Price). Overall, not a complete disaster but ludicrous, contrived and corny and possibly the worst films of Whale and Price(possibly Fairbanks as well). 3/10 Bethany Cox",

The complete box-set print is absolutely pristine and gleamingly atmospheric as was only achievable with nitrate stock.\n\nThe plot you can liken to a game of keeping a ball in the air, the members of the cast who let it drop to the ground get murdered. It's impossible to explain the complexities of it all - in short Nick's trying to prevent a murder, then trying to catch the murderer - from a dizzying array of suspects. This is Red Herring City, right up to the very end when Nick unmasked the surprise murderer and even the housekeeper's motives are explained in a dismissive sentence - but not corroborated. If you want to work out whodunnit for yourself my advice is keep a very open mind! If you don't like whodunnits at all watch this solely for the astonishing dance routine by Rene & Estela - Fred & Ginger were awkward in comparison!\n\nI'm going to have to watch this again, soon and sober to tie up some of the threads I lost along the way.

MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith) who is being threatened, blackmailed and terrorised by ex-employee Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard).\n\nWhen MacFay is murdered in the night, Church becomes the prime suspect, but the affable, scotch swigging Nick Charles believes otherwise. He intends to prove this by once again coming out of retirement and investigating the case as only he knows how.\n\nAll the great Thin Man ingredients are here, the suspense, the mystery, the romance, and above all the comedy as Powell and Loy, one of cinemas most frequently paired and enjoyable double acts once again spar off each other to perfection. Its plain to see why their films were so popular. Never before or since has Hollywood seen such a perfectly matched comedy partnership.\n\nSuspects in this murder include Otto Kruger, Nat Pendleton, Tom Neal, Virginia Gray, Patric Knowles, Abner Biberman and Don Costello, and in a typical Thin Man ending, Nick gathers them together to pick out his man. \n\nThis movie maintains the wit and humour of the first two offerings, and Powell and Loy's screen chemistry is never better. All in all, a great addition to the series and one in keeping with two previous movies, but alas all good things must end. \n\nIt was plain to see, that with the obvious war clouds looming, Nick and Nora's sophisticated banter and well-to-do lifestyle would soon be out of touch and out of date with the difficult times that lay ahead. In point of fact I believe that when we watch this film, we are witnessing the last true great Thin Man film to be made.\n\nThe series struggled on through three more disappointing efforts, before ultimately being laid to rest, and I think the reason for their failure was purely down to changing times and attitudes. In the next two films Nick and Nora live in a modest flat, and references to their vast fortune, have been sensitively toned down if not obliterated as a nod to a sombre, struggling and rationed war-time audience.\n\nHowever the public could not accept The Charles family in a mediocre fashion so the films suffered as a result from the gesture.\n\nBy the time the final film, Song of the Thin Man was made in 1947, and with the war still fresh in the publics mind it was too late to bring back the humour and attitudes of the prosperous and carefree days of the late 1930's and the Charles' had irreparably lost touch with their audience.\n\nLuckily we still have the first three movies to show us what a true screwball comedy mystery should be, and why William Powell and Myrna Loy will always be remembered as two of the greatest.",

Aubrey Smith, that craggy paragon of old-fashioned values, beaten, shot and stabbed to death and then finishes with Shemp Howard, one of the Stooges, dandling a baby, you might believe you're in some odd alternate universe. In a way, you are, but the universe is the world of Nick and Nora Charles and the movie is Another Thin Man. It's the third film William Powell and Myrna Loy made about the debonaire amateur sleuth and his wealthy wife. If it doesn't quite reach the heights of witty sophistication of the first two, it'll do. \n\nNick and Nora, together with their new baby and Asta, are at the Long Island estate of the aging and imperious Burr MacFay (Smith), the partner of Nora's father before her father died. He's a financial wizard who still manages much of Nora's wealth...and he believes he's a man under a death threat. Within hours of their arrival, late at night, a fire starts in the ornate bath house, a fuse apparently blows taking out all the lights, the huge dog of the house is found killed...and MacFay is discovered shot, beaten and stabbed. Yet everyone seems to have an alibi. And what a bunch there is: MacFay's adopted daughter, Lois MacFay; Dudley Horn, the man she plans to marry who seems to love her money as much as he says he loves her; Freddie Coleman, MacFay's young, baby-faced secretary who is smitten with Lois; Mrs. Bellam, the curiously uncurious housekeeper; and Dorothy Waters, the nanny Nora engaged to help look after Nickie, Jr., who suddenly disappears. Those are the ones in the mansion. Lurking outside is a former employee of MacFay, Phil Church, who went to prison and now has schemes to cash in; his girl friend, his loyal goon and a slow-speaking piece of muscle who wears thick glasses. Nick and Nora head back to New York as soon as they can, but the mystery and the threats follow them. It takes a visit to the apartment of a woman no one seems to have met and some clever thinking before Nick brings everyone together in the Charles' hotel apartment where the ruthless murderer is exposed. Even that is complicated by Nickie, Jr.'s boithday party thrown by some of Nick's disreputable acquaintances and their kids. \n\nIn the meantime, we get to enjoy the imperturbable, affectionate and wittily ironic relationship between Nick and Nora, and delight in the expert playing of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Nick and Nora, especially Nick, enjoys his martinis and scotch, but this time around it's a little less obvious and a little more fun. \"A Bacardi,\" says Nick to the waiter in a Latin nightclub. He glances over at Nora and adds, \"Two Bacardis.\" Says Nora with a straight face to the waiter, \"I'll have the same.\" The waiter brings four Bacardis. The mystery is complicated and, in my view, a little too much time is spend on it at the expense of time with the two of them. Still, the movie's extended nightclub scene shows just how witty, light and affectionate Powell and Loy could be when they had enough time to work their characters together. They made 14 movies together over 20 years, including the six in the Thin Man series. Individually or together, Powell and Loy were class acts. \n\nAnd yes, Shemp Howard really is there. So's a chest-thumping Marjorie Main.",

Director W S Van Dyke fully utilises the comedic opportunities offered by a trick-playing dog and a cute baby but even to me, who normally finds such distractions annoying do not mind one bit and actually enjoy them.\n\nIf you already enjoy the Thin Man films, then you will like this one, too. Some say that by this point the franchise had already lost its magic and sparkle and I suppose they could be right. However, it is still enjoyable and Loy and Powell are ever beguiling and sophisticated.",

On the way to the house Nick spots a dead body by the road but, when he investigates, the body is nowhere to be found. Continuing to the estate Nick discovers that MacFay fears for his life; in particular from Phil Church who wants revenge for a past wrong and claims to have foreseen MacFay's murder in his dreams. When MacFay is found murdered the police start a manhunt for Church, but it is all a bit too tidy and convenient to convince Nick.\n\nI must be honest and say that the idea that a baby had been added to the mix made my heart sink and made me worry that, as with some modern films/TV shows, the addition of a baby was an attempt to freshen up the series and that it would rely on this infant too much. Fortunately, although it may have been added to freshen things up a little, the film generally sticks to the aspects of the original that made that film work well enough for us to get to film three in the series even if it has drifted away from the tone of the original a little bit. The mystery story starts well, with plenty of interesting aspects but I didn't feel like it did enough to maintain that sense of mystery and build on it. It was still interesting enough to do the job but maybe not as strong as it could have been. The comedy still has plenty of laughs and sharp lines but it isn't as great as the original. In the original film everything seemed to exist within a tongue-in-cheek, winking cocktail hour to which we were all invited, here it can't help but seem a little more straight-laced even if it is still fun.\n\nThe cast are as good as before although the leads are not quite as fresh as they had been a few years earlier. Powell is funny and he works well with Loy, who holds her own again and has a good chemistry. The support cast are a bit more colourful than the usual b-movie fare; Pendleton makes a nice return, Smith is larger than life in his early role, Kruger is good as the rest are generally, meanwhile it is nice to see Asta back even if the dog hasn't got a great deal to do.\n\nOverall this is an enjoyable film but, like most of the sequels, doesn't really get it as right as it did in the original film. The mystery starts well but only fades as a result while the comedy is funny but not quite what I had hoped for despite the cast doing all they can. Worth seeing of course because it is an enjoyable film in an enjoyable series but those who have not seen the first film in the series would do better to start there.",

The Thin Man himself in the first movie wasn't a reference to William Powell's character, but to a missing inventor thought to be a murderer at the beginning of the film. Following the events of \"After the Thin Man\", one might expect that this story would have something to do with those little booties Nora Charles (Myrna Loy) was knitting at the end of that picture. This one does start out with new addition Nickie Jr., but his presence is only a slight distraction before the main event gets under way. I'll have to see how this all plays out with the remaining films I've yet to see.\n\nWell I might have missed a beat watching this one because the resolution to the story by Nick Charles (Powell) seemed overly complicated in the telling. With a body appearing and disappearing on the side of the road on the way to McFay's (C. Aubrey Smith), it appeared that the screen writers were doing their best to keep anyone watching off balance and in a constant state of puzzlement. Especially perplexing to me was a reference made to Sheldon Leonard's character Phil Church as the 'Dream Butcher'. He did look a little shady, but gee, that seemed a little harsh to me.\n\nSay, did you catch that dance number at the India Club with the Latin duo? Wow, was that ever smooth! I've been around for a while now, and I've never seen a routine performed like that before, and that's after countless movies and having watched more than a fair share of variety shows going back to the late Fifties and early Sixties. That couple was the epitome of elegance, simply gliding across the floor with a grace that seemed effortless. Man, I'd love to be able to dance like that.\n\nI guess if you go back and watch the picture a second time the story makes a lot more sense. For example, the character of Dorothy Waters (Ruth Hussey), Little Nickie's new nanny, looking all shifty eyed and nervous and then disappearing after the MacFay murder, eventually gets explained reasonably enough. The bit with the musical chair babies near the end of the picture seemed a little far fetched, something you might have seen in a Three Stooges flick, and then all of a sudden, there's Shemp Howard right in the middle of it! Oh well.\n\nSo with three down and three to go, I'll stick with the original 'Thin Man' as my favorite for now. However with Powell and Loy as the leads, you're going to be entertained no matter what, so I'll just go with the flow and see how things go from here.",

                "text": "'The Thin Man' series of films, starring the perfect cinematic coupling of William Powell and Myrna Loy, is fast becoming one of my favourite movie collections. For the first two outings, the emphasis of the films has been on the witty marital banter of the keen detective couple, Nick and Nora Charles. The murder mysteries themselves took a noticeable back seat to all of this, reaching a perfect balance, and making sure the final products are wonderfully funny, mysterious, witty and suspenseful. 'Another Thin Man' is the third movie of the series, out of a total of six. When we left off last time, Nick's incredible criminal intellect was failing to grasp the connection between a pair of baby's bootees and a coming addition to the Charles household.\n\nSince the release of the original film in 1934, critics and fans had been using the term \"The Thin Man\" to refer to Nick Charles, when, in actual fact, it referred to the secretive inventor Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), who went missing. However, for the first time, the filmmakers go along with this common misconception, with the title \"Another Thin Man\" referring to the one-year-old Nick Charles, Jr. Perhaps surprisingly, given the addition of a baby to the mix, the film is noticeably darker than its predecessors. Among the heinous crimes committed are numerous murders, the slaughter of a pet dog (not Asta, I can assure you), and Nick's family being verbally threatened with bodily harm. The comedy is most certainly still there, but, in this case, it seems to have taken a back-seat to the mystery. Baby Nick Charles has little to do with the plot \u0096 just like Asta before him, he is just an amusing sidekick to provide the occasional physical gag.\n\nWhen Nora's paranoid uncle, Colonel Burr MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith), suspects that an unfriendly former-employee, Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard), is out to kill him, our favourite couple \u0096 with Nick Jr. (William A. Poulsen) and Asta in tow \u0096 reluctantly arrive to investigate. However, it isn't long before a string of sinister practical jokes escalates into the old man's murder, and there is a host of suspicious suspects for Nick and Nora to interrogate. Significant supporting are played very well by Virginia Grey, Otto Kruger, Ruth Hussey, Nat Pendleton, Patric Knowles, Tom Neal, Phyllis Gordon and Don Costello, with Harry Bellaver as a hilarious, overly-enthusiastic ex-con who is determined to throw little Nick Jr. a birthday party. Though perhaps not quite the solid comedy that the first films were, as a mystery film, 'Another Thin Man' is still one of the best you'll find from the 1930s. And, with more twists and turns than a windy mountain road, you'll never guess who the murderer is.",

I never quite understood what made it different than the other THIN MAN FILMS until I read some of the other reviews listed here at IMDB.com.  I guess it, as some have described, is darker film or perhaps grittier would be a better word.  Anyway, the next three THIN MAN sequels all followed a very basic formula.  All that changes were the names and faces but the people were all the same.  Those three films were, in my opinion, targeted at the current fans.  No doubt the fan base was large and guaranteed a good return at the box office.  However, the love bickering that went on between Nick and Nora was no longer fresh.  The plots all followed the same formula and even Asta the dog was no longer as amusing as he first was.  In general all the other sequels followed the time old Hollywood tradition of redressing the same old story to lure fans back to the theater and wring some more money out of them.\n\nANOTHER THIN MAN did seem to leave some of the overt comedy behind and focused on plot a little bit more.  I didn't notice as big a change in the formulas as others have but it is clear that VanDyke was trying to approach the film from a different angle.  As this was only the second sequel to the original THIN MAN the view, if he/she watches all six films in the order they were made, may not notice some of characteristic plot devices.  More than anything else I think this is the last THIN MAN film that showed Nick and Nora's playful bickering and loving digs at each other and it still seemed believable to the viewers.  By the fourth film it no longer seemed genuine or practical.  Instead of falling into the dull married routine in later films Nick and Nora still playfully feel each other out and take pleasure in pushing each others buttons.  To me this didn't seem that realistic for an old married couple but it was still fresh in ANOTHER THIN MAN.  \n\nThis film should appeal to all THIN MAN fans as well as the more casual viewer.  If this is the first film you've seen of the THIN MAN movies I suggest watching THE THIN MAN and AFTER THE THIN MAN before watching any of the other THIN MAN films.\n",

And the banter in this film gets high marks for its cleverness, keeping the film light-hearted at every turn.\n\nAmong the other actors are a few worth noticing--Sheldon Leonard in only his second credited role in a feature film, Marjorie Main as a funny landlady, and Shemp Howard who is uncredited.\n\nBut William Powell and Myrna Loy really shine in their roles, thanks to their glib delivery and some smart writing.",

                "text": "The third and most entertaining of this big-budget, six-picture series, Another Thin Man is a must-see for all but the most impressionable youngsters who might find some of the scenes a little too frighteningly noirish. The script is rowdy and witty and full of delightfully off-beat characters. In fact, on a 2014 viewing of Warner's superb DVD, maybe some of the characters are way too off- beat for audience recognition. The pace is deliberately frenetic in order to cover holes in the plot. A successful stratagem! At the end of the movie, Mickey Mouse could have been produced as the culprit with no lesser loss of credence. A group of talented main and cameo players are given plenty of opportunities to embellish their roles with humorous bits of business. The identity of the murderer is certainly well hidden and, considering the occasional ineptitudes of After the Thin Man, Van Dyke has directed with remarkable gusto, pace and craftsmanship. As for the camera-work, my guess is that William Daniels photographed all the noirishly moody C. Aubrey Smith footage and that Oliver T. Marsh did the rest of the picture. \n\nBased on a short story, \"The Farewell Murder\", originally featuring Hammett's Continental Op (a nameless operative for the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, the character is modeled both on Hammett himself and James Wright, assistant superintendent of Pinkerton's Baltimore office, who was Hammett's former boss. The series recounts many of Hammett's own experiences as a Pinkerton detective).",

Aubrey Smith), the former business partner of Nora's late father, begs (or rather commands) them to come to his estate on Long Island, under the pretext of wanting Nick to help him with his tax declaration. But he soon admits that he fears for his life: his business transactions weren't always quite... on the level in the past, and when the irregularities came to light, engineer Phil Church had to take the rap; and now that he's out of prison after ten years, he threatens to kill McFay...\n\nAs was to be expected, he soon IS murdered; and in exactly the way Church had described mysteriously, talking about seeing things in his dreams that always come true the third time... But when soon afterward the fianc\u00e9e of McFay's adoptive daughter Lois is killed, too, we know that we have to take into account others as well: the young detective novel writer who's also in love with Lois, the somewhat strange housekeeper who knew Church from the time of the financial affair and who later admits that she's Lois' mother, Church's buddy \"Dum-Dum\" and his girlfriend Smitty - and even Lois herself, who of course is the sole heir to McFay's fortune! But Lois has got an alibi, because she was with Nick and Nora when the shot fell - and Church has got an alibi as well, as we learn later on...\n\nThis second sequel, like the original \"Thin Man\" movie, is loosely based on a story by Dashiell Hammett; and it's a REAL good old-fashioned crime puzzle, with lots of suspects, plot twists, and an ending that'll take everybody by surprise who didn't pay attention every single second and to every little detail of the film! Nick and Nora are once more hilariously funny with their playful squabbling; and this time they've got another co-star besides terrier Asta: their baby, which in the end during one of the few really serious moments of the movie even becomes the protagonist for a short while...\n\nA VERY worthy part of the series, almost better than the previous one; and a REAL enjoyment not only for the many fans of Nick and Nora, but for every friend of classic crime movies with a sense of humor!",

The swimming pool's on fire.\" (A lady speaking in a extremely calm voice).\n\nThe problem here is that the movie is too busy and with too many characters. You even get a rather strange interlude at a night club with a rumba dancing segment. What is that? Apparently, that was entertaining at that time.\n\nAs for suspects, you get a goon named Church, his moll named Smitty, his manservant or crony named Dumb Dumb (again: what is that?), another goon named \"Diamond Back\" Vogel (I still don't know what that means) etc. etc. You can't count them on two hands.\n\nWhen we finally see the case solved, it may come as a surprise who the real murderer is but only because we have been distracted so many times, that we actually forgot to pay attention to the scenes that advance the plot. There is even a baby party hosted by the mob for Nick and Nora's baby. What happens there? Bedroom farce.\n\nThere are some genuinely good times to be had, watching it and no one plays sexy innocence better than Myrna Loy.

                "text": "ANOTHER THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by W.S. Van Dyke II, returns those society sleuths, Nick and Nora Charles, to the screen for the third time. Following the earlier successes of THE THIN MAN (1934) and AFTER THE THIN MAN (1936), it's by now official through these titles that Nick Charles has assumed the identification of \"The Thin Man\" rather than the character enacted in the initial film. In keeping both the popular pairing of William Powell & Myrna Loy and the series going, its creator, Dashiell Hammett, who contributed to the story, makes one minor change in the format by adding in a new central character, another thin man, Nick Charles Jr. With the responsibility in parenthood, Nick and Nora continue to find time enjoying themselves and solving some new murders to what's supposed to be their quiet weekend together.\n\nReturning by train to New York from San Francisco, Nick and Nora Charles (Powell and Loy), along with their terrier, Asta, and almost year old son, Nicky Jr. (William Anthony Poulsen), register at the Hotel Northampton with an assortment of individual crates and suitcases, plus Asta's plastic fire hydrant. Not long after settling down in their suite, Nora receives a phone call from Colonel Burr MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith), her guardian and retired manufacturer, wanting her and Nick to spend the weekend at his estate, but doesn't reveal why. As MacFay's chauffeur (Horace MacMahon) drives the family, accompanied by Nicky's nanny, Dorothy Walters (Ruth Hussey), to the country home in Long Island, a dead man is seen along the side of the road. As Nick gets out to investigate, both the body and their chauffeur have disappeared. Later, Nick and Nora learn that MacFay, in fear of his life, is being threatened by Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard), a former business associate who served ten years in prison based on the colonel's testimony against him. MacFay doesn't approve of his Dudley Horn (Patric Knowles), a man engaged to his daughter, Lois (Virginia Grey), though Freddie Coleman (Tom Neal), MacFay's secretary, makes it known he's in love with Lois. A series of mysterious events soon take place starting with swimming pool fire, the killing of Jesse, MacFay's dog, and finally MacFay himself. When Nick suddenly gets death threats himself, he comes out of retirement, joining forces with his friend, Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton), to investigate, while at the same time keeping Nora from interfering in their latest caper. And so goes Nick and Nora's quiet weekend in the country.\n\nOther featured members of the cast include Otto Kruger (Ben Van Slack, Assistant District Attorney); Phyllis Gordon (Isabella Bellam, MacFay's housekeeper); Don Costello (\"Diamond Back\" Vogel); Harry Bellaver (\"Creeps\" Binder); Muriel Hutchinson (Smitty, Phil Church's mistress); Abner Biberman (\"Dum-Dum\"); and Marjorie Main (Mrs. Dolley, landlady of the Chesterfield Apartments). Familiar faces of Bert Roach (\"Cookie\") and Shemp Howard (\"Wacky\") are briefly seen to good advantage. Of those newcomers introduced to the screen, Sheldon Leonard (the future TV producer and director) makes a lasting impression through his distinctive voice and tough guy personality, while Don Costello's mystery man with thick glasses, a true reminder of Raymond Burr a decade later, a little menacing, through not easily memorable.\n\nWhile not up to the initial two entries the developed into the \"Thin Man\" series, ANOTHER THIN MAN (originally titled RETURN OF THE THIN MAN during production) is still quite satisfying. One would have assumed by its new title, ANOTHER THIN MAN, that the Nick Charles character gets to match wits with either his twin brother or encounters a look-alike villain. Either way might have developed into a better screenplay. On the other hand, Powell's Nick Charles is still played as confident as he is witty. He's also well liked by many, especially the unusual characters bearing oddball names whom he sent to prison during one of his earlier investigations, none holding any grudge against him. Even in between his constant boozing, Nick is able to obtain enough evidence to gather the motive and close in on the killer as well as arranging a birthday party for his year-old son. Nora, still a sophisticate, has now acquired a new pet name from Nick, \"Mommy.\" Nora's dance sequence with a South American gigolo (Alexander D'Arcy) at the West Indies Club as observed by Nick is one of the comedic highlights. Asta, isn't given much to do this time around, but still an attention grabber whenever he's around, whether barking or doing summer salts. Nat Pendleton, appearing nearly an hour from the opening credits, returns for his second and final go round in the series, making this his last out of five screen appearances opposite Powell. \n\nThe popularity of ANOTHER THIN MAN constituted three additional episodes in the series spanning through 1947. All distributed to home video and later DVD, the six \"Thin Man\" mysteries can be seen and enjoyed by mystery lovers whenever tuning in on Turner Classic Movies cable channel. Next installment: SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN (1941). (**1/2)",

But all these plot machinations serve to do is get in the way of giving us what we really paid to see: Powell and Loy. Is it any wonder that the most memorable scenes in this film are those in which the charismatic pair take time out from sleuthing to trade a sarcastic insult, or a smile, or a kiss? When Powell approaches a table in a nightclub surrounded by a group of men, and then realizes as the men pull away that the object of their attention is his wife, the smile Loy flashes him as she sits there looking adorable is alone worth sitting through the movie for. But this sequel, like \"After the Thin Man\" three years before it, isn't able to recapture that quality that made the first \"Thin Man\" film a totally unique cinematic experience.\n\nGrade: C",

Hers is a formidable but somewhat overpowering presence. On the other hand, the movie's nominal heroine, the lovely Evalyn Knapp, hardly figures in the action at all. And as far as third- billed Robert Kent is concerned, he may as well not have been cast in this quickie. It's Frankie, Lillian and Matty Fain who do all the running. Admittedly, when young Frankie and stocky Lillian are not hogging the screen, there is some good, fast chase action footage along the way \u0096 though I suspect some of it is stock. Directed in a thoroughly routine style by Howard Bretherton, this Wanted will mostly be unwanted by everyone except diminutive Darro's keenest fans. Available on a very good Alpha DVD.",

                "text": "\n\tWhen it comes right down to it, what you `think' you want isn't necessarily what you `really' want, nor is it likely to be anything you need.  But finding the answer is up to the individual, a prospect that's explored in the satirical `Sullivan's Travels,' directed by Preston Sturges.  Movie director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) has made a career of churning out one successful comedy after another, yet he remains unfulfilled.  He longs to do a `serious' film, one with meaning, a drama that will leave his mark on the industry and the world.  And he has a property that he thinks is perfect, a screenplay entitled `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'  The studio he works for, however, balks at the idea; Sullivan's comedies are not only good, they're a cash cow for the studio, so why fool with success?\n\n\tSullivan is adamant, though, and determined to make his film he strikes a bargain with the studio and gets the green light.  But once he's given the go-ahead, he wants to do it right-- and he realizes that to make a truly meaningful film, he must first experience himself the hardships of life he will be examining in `O Brother.'  So with only a dime in his pockets, he sets out on the road to find out what `life' is really all about.  And before it's over, he will get all he's looking for and more, in an odyssey that will be unforgettable for Sullivan, and for the audience, as well. \n\n\n\tFilled with pathos and poignancy, Sturges' film is an insightful sojourn across the territory of the human condition.  It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, as along with Sullivan you come face to face with some hard truths about reality.  And Sullivan's eventual epiphany regarding his personal wants and needs may be your own, as well, because this is a film with a definite message that is honest and undeniable.  A lesson in life delivered subtly and sensitively by Sturges, who makes it entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  It's refreshing, in fact, t discover a film that delivers such an impact without having to resort to any kind of sensationalism, relying instead on the inherent humanity of the story, which Sturges conveys masterfully.  With exceptions, of course, it's a sensibility few of today's directors seem to possess.  Some notable exceptions would be Ang Lee with `The Ice Storm,' Kenneth Lonergan's `You Can Count On Me' and Tom DiCillo's `Box of Moonlight.'  All are films that, like `Sullivan,' are journeys of discovery, profound in sentiment without being overly sentimental.  There are more, to be sure, but they seem too few and far between.\n\n\tOne of the elements that makes this film so engaging is its colorful cast of characters, and the actors it employs to bring it to life, beginning with it's star, McCrea, who hits his stride as Sullivan with facility.  He credibly reflects Sullivan's ideals and principles with a look, as well as an attitude, that makes it work quite naturally.  You can believe this is a man with, perhaps not a naive, but certainly a rather guarded perception of life in the real world.  Which is not to say he lacks insight or wisdom; it's merely one of the basic truths this film points out-- that people live within parameters of their own design, established through personal experience and frame of reference.  And that's the John Sullivan McCrea presents here, with a portrayal that is honest and incisive.\n\n\tVeronica Lake was one of the hottest actresses around in 1942 when this film was made, and as the girl who becomes a part of Sullivan's journey, she lends considerable charm and a bit of mystique to the film.  It's a fairly straightforward role that benefits from her sparkle and personality; a notable performance that adds a touch of humor and some class to the proceedings, without being particularly exceptional.  But watching her, it's easy to understand the attention she received, especially after draping her long blond hair across her eye, peek-a-boo style-- which started a craze that swept the country, while creating an indelible image that ultimately defined her career.\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes Robert Warwick (Mr. Lebrand), William Demarest (Mr. Jones), Franklin Pangborn (Mr. Casalsis), Porter Hall (Mr. Hadrian), Byron Foulger (Mr. Valdelle), Margaret Hayes (Secretary), Robert Greig (Sullivan's Butler) and Eric Blore (Sullivan's Valet).  Call it a lesson in life, or a lesson about human nature; however you see it, `Sullivan's Travels' is an experience you're going to remember.  Entertaining, enjoyable and enlightening, it's an uplifting appreciation of the way things are, and not necessarily the way you `think' they should be.  It's a film that celebrates the comfort to be found in finding your own niche and realizing the importance of whatever it is that you contribute to your world and those around you.  It leaves you with a sense of purpose and the understanding that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  And it makes your own grass look pretty good in the bargain.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.     ",

                "text": "\nSturges' most daringly double-edged film, laced with bitter ironies.  It is also arguably the most audacious film in Hollywood's (mainstream) history, audacious because it takes the kinds of risks that can so easily fall flat on their face, and right until the final image, as Sturges becomes increasingly ambitious and multi-layered, you wonder how long he can keep it up without getting ridiculous.  It never does, but the film is so full of contradictions, tensions, suppressions, clanging lurches in tone - 'Travels' is ostensibly a comedy, and one of Hollywood's best, but the last twenty minutes are truly painful to watch, harrowing and not at all funny.\n\nThe overriding source of tension, of course,  is the film itself, the plot, and the emotions that are supposed to be elicited.  It is very difficult, and frequently impossible to gauge the tone of any one scene.  Sometimes this is straightforward, as when information is deliberately withheld from the audience, it is asked to make a judgement, and then shown to be wrong, as in the scenes where the studio moguls claim a background of deprivation (which is historically plausible).  This kind of comedy is familiar enough. \n\n\nBut what about the later montage of Sullivan and the Girl experiencing the 'reality' of poverty - are these scenes supposed to be genuine representation of poverty?  Are they part of a wider satire on pious films like 'Grapes of Wrath', which dubiously aestheticise poverty - there are a lot of Expressionistic flourishes in this sequence?  Are they a kind of abstract purgatory through which Sullivan finds spiritual understanding? \n\n\nThere is a big difference between the representation of poverty in this sequence and the one where Sullivan is attacked and sent to prison.  But is one more 'authentic' than the other - the second one bravely rejects the view of 'noble' poverty, shows how it dehumanises people, turns them instinctual and brutal; but it also provides a neat moral, which suggests that if you do somebody wrong, you will be (horribly) punished for it.  This realism, therefore, is as contrived as the first.  Is this Sturges' point, that the good intentions of realism are always tainted by ideological assumptions, patronising good-will, or motives of elevation.  This sense of artifice, of a film comprised of varying self-reflexive modes rather than a plausible narrative, runs through 'Travels', with characters talking about the film they're in as a plot - in direst danger, Sullivan acknowledges the need for a helluva twist which duly arrives, filmed in silent slapstick with barely concealed Sturges contempt (and did his friends seem terribly put out by his death?).\n\nThis would seem to uphold 'Travels'' ostensible theme, its celebration of comedy as a sugar with which to sweeten the harshness of reality.  This is a very cynical view of comedy, and a highly manipulative, conservative one - distract an unhappy populace from the injustice of their lives.  The best comedies - from 'Sherlock Jr' and 'Modern Times' to 'Playtime' and 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' have always been about real life, encouraging their viewers to think harder about the society they live in, much more effectively than so-called naturalism.  \n\n'Travels' is no exception.  It might be a celebration of comedy, but this is comedy a million miles from 'Ants in your Pants'.  What other 40s film still manages to show the brutality of poverty, of the prison system, of race relations, the fate of young women in sexually voracious Hollywood (the Girl's ease with her body in the swimming pool scene speaks volumes), however we choose to read them?  When Sullivan's determination at the end to continue making populist comedies is endorsed by the ringing laughter of the world's meek and suffering, the disjunction is grotesque.  This is a man, on an airplane, completely removed from reality, surrounded by wealthy toadies.  Those happy laughs could so easily be contemptuous guffaws, because what Sullivan wants to do, and Sturges hasn't, is hide the inequalities of capitalism, the system on which Hollywood thrives, and the flaws in which they would be only too happy to cover up with inanity.  But to even suggest this is to fall into the 'Capra' trap mocked at the beginning.\n\nThis difficulty is what makes 'Travels' such a stunningly modern film - its shifts from sophisticated verbal wit to elaborate slapstick to blatant Carry On-like innuendo (the matronly sister dusting  the bedpost after seeing a sweating, shirtless Sullivan work) to tragedy to hallucination and dream to satire foreshadows Melville and the New Wave, while the privileged rich man who cannot escape Hollywood would transmute into the guests who can't leave the house, or can't get dinner in later Bunuel films; or the film that begins with an end.  The opening sequence takes off 'Citizen Kane'.  The deadpan genderplay is quietly gobsmacking, and Veronica Lake as a (gorgeous) tramp would be alluded to by Jeanne Moreau in 'Jules et JIm'.  But the joys are all Sturges', as he democratises comedy (see again that swimming pool sequence);  I love in particular those glorious supporting actors: my favourite being the immortal Eric Blore and Robert Greig as Sullivan's servants.",

Preston Sturges showed he was an original with this story about self-discovery for a man that has a different view of the world. In a way, this is a satire about the movie industry.\n\nHollywood in the early years, wouldn't touch any project that it deemed non commercial. Which is why when John Sullivan, a successful director of film comedies decides to do a movie based on a serious book, the studio thinks he must be going crazy. Why would this director want to make the movie going public think? It was a preposterous notion then, as well as today, when basically all movies making any points are independently produced. After all, the industry wants everyone to have a great time, be entertained, and not make them think about at all.\n\nJohn Sullivan gets much more than what he bargained for when he decides to take to the back roads of the country, dressed as a hobo and with only ten cents in his pocket. The first check on reality comes when he meets the kind girl at the road side diner. He is hungry, but what can one get for a dime? This girl, who has had it trying to make a name in the movies, orders ham and eggs for him, no strings attached. If there is a more kindred soul than this young woman who wants nothing in return, we haven't met her yet.\n\nSully and the girl go back on the road where they witness the reality of America's indigents traveling back and forth in empty cattle cars all over the country in search of jobs, or perhaps a better living. Sullivan ultimately wants to give money anonymously to the poor people he has met, but he meets with disaster and ends up in jail, the victim of circumstantial evidence and he is sent to jail. One night Sully discovers the great mystery about the allure of the pictures: It's the laughter stupid! Sullivan realizes how far off the mark he has been in trying to bring drama to the masses.\n\nJoel McCrea makes a fantastic Sullivan. This under estimated man was a great comedian, as well as an actor that is always believable. The whole reason for watching this movie is Mr. McCrea's performance. His chemistry with the ravishingly beautiful and young Veronica Lake is one of the best things in the film. Both these actors, under Mr. Sturges' direction do their best work on screen. Sturges makes fun at his own expense when the girl asks Sully if he can introduce her to the great Hollywood director, Ernst Lubitsch. Mr. McCrea and Ms. Lake seem to be having a fun time together.\n\nMr. Sturges always surrounded himself with a group of actors that one sees in his movies. Robert Greig, Eric Blore, William Demarest, and the rest of the cast contribute to make this a winning comedy. The best scene that involves most of these actors happen at the beginning of the film when they are chasing Sullivan in the R.V. and things inside the trailer begin falling all over the place. That was priceless movie making.\n\nPreston Sturges combines a social commentary with comedy in this brilliant film that is a tribute to his genius.",

It's an anti-message film, loaded with humor, with a most sublime message indeed.\n\nJoel McCrea plays director John Sullivan who's tired of making silly comedies and musicals for his studio. He wants to make films of social significance with a message about the troubles in today's world.\n\nProblem is that he doesn't know anything about poverty and unemployment, he's a rich kid who's been to boarding school. So off he sets, several times it turns out, to discover how the other half lives.\n\nThat last time he sets out is a bit unplanned and through a combination of circumstances he winds up on a prison chain gang in some southern state. He learns some really profound lessons from that experience.\n\nBut that's the serious side of Sullivan's Travels. Before that the film has some really gut splitting funny moments like McCrea learning about the speed of a whippet tank, being accused of stealing his own car. But my favorite is when he falls in the clutches of spinsters Elmira Sessions and Esther Howard. McCrea sets out to learn about poverty and deprivation and the two sisters see him as the answer to some poverty and deprivation they've been suffering for some time. Maybe the chain gang didn't look so bad.\n\nVeronica Lake in her memoirs said that one of the films she enjoyed most was Sullivan's Travels where she plays an disillusioned Hollywood hopeful who befriends the tramp McCrea without knowing who he really is. The following year Lake would be paired with Alan Ladd who was closer to her height. She said McCrea was a kind and decent man and wonderful to work with. The disparity of their height was the source of some amusement and some problems for Preston Sturges. Lake was a tiny thing, it was why she was teamed with Alan Ladd, and McCrea was well over six feet tall. Check the shots of them together, very rarely will you see them standing side by side.\n\nSturges used a lot of his regular company of players. My two favorites in the supporting cast are Robert Grieg and Edward Blore who are McCrea's butler and valet. Both turn out to be wise men in their warnings to their boss about this folly he is undertaking.\n\nIt's been said that Sullivan's Travels is supposed to be the anti-Frank Capra film about messages. I'm not sure Capra saw it that way. If you look at the portion of the film when Sullivan falls into this unfamiliar universe of the chain gang, it's very similar to what George Bailey was experiencing in that parallel universe he was sent to in It's A Wonderful Life. I think Sturges and Capra would find a lot of common ground in the messages of It's A Wonderful Life and Sullivan's Travels.",

If you want your comedy to be tightly constructed, meaningful, unambiguous, and logical, then you do not want comedy at all -- you want some stuffy college professor's idea of What is Comedy for a term paper.\n\nThe glorious truth is that you cannot domesticate great comedy.  It occurs on no regular basis, from no reliable source, and is accountable to no one for what it says and does.  Preston Sturges wanted to make that point in Sullivans Travels and he does so exceedingly well with everything from slapstick frolics in the land cruiser to fleas in the bed to hectoring soliloquies about poverty from the butler.\n\nTen years before Chaplin tried to explain the same thing in his movie Limelight, Sturges tells a tale meant to both hearten and cozen us.  It heartens us to know that a cynical, moneygrubbing place like Hollywood will continue to spin out comedies, because they make money.  And it cozens us into thinking there is something magical about comedians.  Anyone who has ever actually known or been married to a professional funnyperson knows they are by turns grumpy, lazy, tempermental, stubborn, and always insecure.  Not the life of the party.

His studio bosses (very funny roles by Robert Warwick and Porter Hall) try to tell him it's a ridiculous idea but Sullivan insists, puts on some hobo clothes and sets out to see what it's like to experience poverty and suffering.

When they are released, the girl decides to join Sullivan in his quest to learn about poverty. When Sullivan is satisfied, he is robbed and dumped unconscious in a train. He awakes in the countryside where there is an incident and he is arrested and sentenced to a labor camp, where he leans the importance of comedy in the miserable lives of destitute people. \n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" is a delightful movie by Preston Sturges with a satire of Hollywood lifestyle and the importance of comedy in the life of people, a relief for a couple of minutes for those that do not have other sort of entertainment. Joel McCrea is very funny in the role of a naive director trying to find how the poor people live. His chemistry with the gorgeous Veronika Lake is perfect and this was the first time that I noted that this lovely actress was only 1.51 m height. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Contrastes Humanos\" (\"Human Contrasts\")",

It is about a big time Hollywood director (played by Joel McCrea) who is absolutely sick and tired of making the hum-drum, silly comedies: \"Hey-Hey in the Hay\" and \"Ants in Your Pants of 1938\". Instead, he wants to make something different...an important, relevant, socially relevant drama about poverty. When he realizes he knows nothing about THAT sort of life, he sets out with 10 cents in his pocket and finds out what it's really like. Along the way, he meets Veronica Lake - who plays \"The Girl\". She is a discouraged aspiring actress getting no where and on the verge of leaving town. Despite her own bad luck, she takes pity on the hobo Sullivan and buys him breakfast. When she eventually finds out his true identity, she insists on accompanying him on the road due to his inexperience at such a lifestyle. Lake does a great job of the dry co-star. She's not the greatest actress but she does justice to the part and offers a bit of eye candy for the viewers in contrast. She is a joy to watch on screen, that's for sure! I want to see more of her movies.\n\nSullivan's Travels is a very funny film with the appeal of Lake, witty comedy and a true underlying message. It is all this whilst still perfectly \"taking the mickey\" out of Hollywood's (often lame) attempts at making a movie with a message. A movie which can be watched by all - essential for those lovers of classic cinema.",

Veronica Lake is lovely and reason alone to watch the film but a very small role performed by Jess Lee Brooks as a kindly preacher is truly wonderful and one that leaves the strongest lasting impression.\n\nThe preacher appears in just one short part but its a scene that the films whole premise and emotional beliefs radiate out from.

As the congregation sing 'Let my People Go' the convicts seem to be summoned up from the surrounding swamp, they somberly march in and sit in their designated pews at the front of the church.

He takes with him Veronica Lake, playing a Hollywood starlet wannabe who's just about ready to throw in the towel. Together, they find out that they can't really ever know what it's like to be poor unless they're actually poor, a fate that eventually befalls Sullivan through a crazy turn of events, after which he rediscovers the value of using film to make people laugh.\n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" is one of those reflexive movies about Hollywood and the business of film making that can be wonderful when done well and entirely too self conscious when done poorly. I can't imagine writer/director Preston Sturges having done a better job than he does here with this simply marvelous film, easily one of the best of the 1940s and perhaps one of the best ever. Rarely have I felt that a director has made his point as clearly and effectively as Sturges does with this film. He manipulates his audience dexterously but not cheaply. When the film takes a dark and sobering turn, we fidget anxiously and wait for it to get funny again, which is exactly the reaction the studio executives in the film's opening tell Sullivan he can expect from his \"important\" film, and why they tell him to stick to comedy in the first place. The irony of course is that in making a film about the value of mindless comedy, Sturges at the same time made a quite important picture that more forcefully addressed the plight of the working man than any number of other films that treated the subject more seriously.\n\nI've never liked Joel McCrea better than I do here. His laconic way with a one liner is perfectly suited to Sturges' brand of quick and witty writing. Indeed, the patter comes at you so quickly that your brain may have trouble keeping up with the jokes. Veronica Lake is cute and droll, and she and McCrea get on well together. The film's best moments come when the pair are learning how to be hobos. And Sturges fills out the rest of his film with a cast of regulars from his stable of character actors, with virtually every member getting some bit of business or a line to remember him by.\n\nHowever, despite Sturges' wonderful dialogue, the film's most memorable and beautiful moment comes when everybody shuts up, and a montage of scenes showing McCrea and Lake experiencing life as it was for countless homeless and unemployed regular Americans at the tail end of the Depression plays out with no sound, accompanied only by a pretty musical passage. In a movie that will take your breath away with its pace and crack comic timing, this moment will take your breath away for different reasons altogether.\n\nGrade: A+",

His first attempt at directing was a success with a string of two popularly and critically acclaimed films in each of the years 1940 and 1941, \"The Great McGinty\", \"Christmas in July\"; \"The Lady Eve\" (starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck), and this film, \"Sullivan's Travels\".\n\nThe beauty of \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the combination in genre of comedy as well as social satire and realism of the tough times of the Great Depression that the country had just weathered for a decade.  Throw a romance in to the mix and a level of redirection of a \"film on film\" to make this an interesting film.\n\nJohn Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a famous director who is at odds with his production company.  They want him to direct a comic film, while he wants to apply his talent to creating an analytic looking glass onto the sobering times called, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\".  Wealthy and successful, he is mocked for not at all knowing misfortune - how would he make such a film? John takes this as a challenge, dresses as a hobo, and leaves the studio with a dime in his pocket to explore what life is like for the down and out.\n\nHowever he tries to flee, he ends up getting somehow quickly being returned to Hollywood.  Early on, he meets \"the girl\" (Veronica Lake; I don't recall her ever being given a name in the film) who sees that he is too innocent to survive on his own, and insists on bringing her broader knowledge of society to the journey and joining him to get him through this learning adventure.\n\nThe first part of the film is comic, but just as it seems to be coming to an unfulfilled ending, something unexpected happens.  This event alters the course of everything and exposes John to some of the true injustices of the time - and shows him (and poignantly reminded me) that comedy is particularly important when some people have nothing else to cheer them up.\n\nThis is a film of classic Hollywood vintage, with good, snappy performances by both of the lead actors.  The romance isn't at all developed but just seems to happen in a matter-of-fact way (perhaps we can take it on faith that there is instant chemistry), but what is lacking in psychology of the relationship is made up for in the chilling glimpse we get of the psyche of the underdog in Depression America.\n\n   --Dilip Barman June 19, 2004",

The first time I saw this pinnacle of Sturges' estimable career was at an \"aud call\" when I was in grammar school. The teachers herded us kids into the auditorium to watch a 16mm print of it and, they hoped, get us out of their hair for an hour and a half. I was only about 6 years old, but I believe \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the first film that ever made me cry tears of joy. It's been more than half a century, but my eyes still well up when I watch it, a sign that either the film is effective or I'm an easy mark. I prefer to believe it's the former.\n\nThe plot tells of John L. \"Sully\" Sullivan, a Hollywood director who is a big success at turning out comedies, but then gets it into his head that he should direct a \"serious\" film with social significance, all about tragedy, hopelessness, and suffering. To prepare himself for this bleak scenario, he decides to go on the road dressed as a bum, with only ten cents in his pocket, to learn what it's like to be poor and hungry. Be careful what you wish for. Before Sullivan's travels come to an end, he will have visited the darkest corner of the deepest pit of the human condition.\n\nThis being a Preston Sturges picture, of course there's a happy ending. But he puts the hero through hell before that happens. There's also a romance of sorts, pairing Sullivan (Joel McRea) with a young woman we know only as The Girl (Veronica Lake). I say \"of sorts\" because there is no love scene per se, no kissing, not even any fond hugging. The closest they ever get physically is one evening when the two ersatz hobos (The Girl has joined him in his masquerade) stop to admire the moon... and put their arms around each other, lightly. Less is more. I think the love between them seems stronger than if they were pawing each other every few minutes.\n\nPreston Sturges began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter (\"Never Say Die\" [1939], \"Remember the Night\" [1940]), but soon prevailed on the studio brass to put him on as a director, because he was frustrated at the way directors were reshaping his words. His first film as both writer and director, \"The Great McGinty\" (1940), was a hit, and won him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Sturges was on his way.\n\nThere's an early scene in \"Sullivan's Travels\" that deftly shows off Sturges' skill with wordplay. McRea, Robert Warwick, and Porter Hall are having a vigorous debate over the wisdom of embarking on Sullivan's new, change-of-pace film. The rapid-fire dialogue is intoxicating to listen to, because it seems the actors never take a breath. As each line ends, a new one begins, as if we are watching a relay race with words instead of batons. That's not all: The entire scene, from beginning to end, is shot in one continuous take, with no cuts. The camera moves as necessary, to follow the actors, but essentially it is all a single shot. And Sturges manages to bring the scene in at four minutes flat. I have no idea how he did it, or how many retakes were needed to achieve this precision. But the effect is mesmerizing.\n\nSturges gives us many great scenes in \"Sullivan's Travels,\" but there is one that really put a lump in my throat. Sully has been imprisoned in a Deep South chain gang presided over by a ruthless warden (the great Alan Bridge). The warden won't brook Sully's independent attitude and resolves to crush his spirit by locking him in \"the sweat box,\" a sadistic, one-man windowless cell where the hapless prisoner is forced to stand for hours, alone.\n\nThe prison trusty, played by Sturges regular Jimmy Conlin, visits the sweat box periodically and gives water to the dehydrated prisoner, and also gives him words of encouragement. Finally, at night, the trusty is allowed to open the sweat box and release Sullivan from this torture device. He unlocks the door, and the exhausted Sullivan collapses into his arms. The camera remains still for several seconds while the trusty cradles him gently. I don't know if Sturges intended this, but the shot reminded me of a Renaissance painting of St. John holding the body of Christ after the Crucifixion.\n\nSullivan's personal epiphany comes when he joins the other prisoners as guests at a local black church, where they are treated to an evening of Mickey Mouse cartoons. The prisoners, the warden, even the preacher, laugh uproariously at the antics of Mickey and his dog Pluto. Finally, Sullivan starts to laugh, too. And that's when this great comedy director realizes the truth: the best gift he can offer his audiences is not dour drama, but comedy -- pictures that enrich the human condition by offering a touch of happiness in a world too filled with tragedy.\n\nMcRea's final line in the movie is one of the greatest closers ever. After Sullivan's eventual escape and reunion with his Hollywood friends, he announces that he won't be making that \"socially significant\" picture after all. He'll stick to making comedies. Why? \"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Do you know that's all some people have? It's not a lot, in this cockeyed caravan, but it's better than nothing. Boy!\"\n\nDan Navarro \u0096 daneldorado93@yahoo.com",

So he can more effectively direct his next film about the tragic human condition.\n\nLots of crazy, zany things happen along the way -- most of which prohibits Sullivan (McCrea) from truly gaining any insight into the life of the less fortunate. Finally, however, something unexpected occurs which truly gives him a new perspective on the poor class and as his role as an entertainer.\n\nWhile many (if not most) consider this film to be a comedy classic, I'm afraid I must disagree. Although there are some humorous parts, the film (in my perspective) fails in it's most lofty ambition -- that is to poignantly express the condition of the less fortunate while wrapping a screwball comedy around it which would be just the kind of entertainment those same unfortunate soles would enjoy -- an ironic movie about movies.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was much more effective in expressing both the sadness of the poor class while mixing in effective and genuinely funny humor. Perhaps his films (and others with similar themes) succeeded where this one failed because we were drawn into the life of someone in the poor class and routed for the underdog as our protagonist in the midst of the humorous circumstances.\n\nIn this case, I found the protagonist to be shallow, selfish and ultimately hypocritical. Here we have a rich, well-to-do Hollywood type pretending to be a tramp and being at a disconnect with their way of life for almost the entire film. As such, we never develop a fondness for his character, even though the circumstances he finds himself in may be interesting. In addition, the whole character of Veronica Lake was entirely out of place in this film. The love interest distracted from the message the film tried to convey, and she couldn't come across as looking even remotely the part of a poor, disadvantaged young girl. She looked much more out of place in the tramp suit than did McCrea.\n\nIn the final vignette where Sullivan supposedly sees the real plight of the \"less fortunate\", it is via rubbing shoulders with hardened criminals (!), not just the poor, unemployed, trampled-upon, everyday man. And then he uses his position of status to its fullest (unethical) extent in order to weasel his way out of his undesired condition. Then we're asked to turn around and cheer for our liberated hero and his supposed \"enlightened viewpoint\". I don't find such a plot that funny or poignant.\n\nNot a classic by any means in my eyes.",

Quite apart from the topic of the story, it turned the new unfettered medium of film into an extension of stage plays. This hampered film for decades. Many people - including filmmakers - still believe that films can be `about' something. That started to change in 1941 with the appearance of two films: `Kane' in which narrative folding was merged with the choreographed camera (already being played with by Hitchcock), and `Travels' which introduced irony into the notion of watching.\n\nIts tricky, what Sturges has done: the film is ostensibly `about' a film. One expects lots of blurring between the two, but he fools us. In the story proper, there is no such blurring. Instead, he blurs the style of the entire enterprise, where it is unclear whether we are IN the movie or watching it. (Look for the incongruous legs in the tree by the riverbank.) This notion of in/out, supplemented by the revolution in acting from Brando, is part of every film made today.\n\nIt is not the grand tour, the loud obvious excess of ideas that is `Kane,' it is simple, single-minded, rather subtle.

Let's just say that it often appears to make fun of serious movies about poverty and injustice--especially The Grapes of Wrath--and the ending appears to undercut the initial leftwing social criticism that the protagonist expresses and puts into the opening \"movie within a movie\". But as in much postmodern irony, this conservative conclusion may itself be only an appearance. At yet another level of the ironical onion, the social criticism remains valid and trenchant--the scenes of poverty and brutality we witness earlier undercut the conclusion that is apparently reached in the last scenes. The racial politics are also unsettling. At the start we get the usual silly stereotype of the African American cook. But in the decisive scene of the movie, African Americans are portrayed as people who treat their fellow human beings with respect and dignity, no matter how terrible their circumstances--which is just about the finest thing you can say about anyone. Nevertheless there is something stereotypical about this image, even if it is a positive stereotype. And African Americans are placed on the \"comedy\" not the \"serious social criticism\" side of the debate in the protagonist's head, a racial representation which is fraught with--well, ambiguity. (For more about this, see Marlon Riggs' Color Adjustment, a brilliant documentary about African Americans on TV.) Finally, this movie was my introduction to Veronica Lake. Wow!",

Back then, when my mother would take me to New York, I wouldn't photograph the skyscrapers or the Hudson River or Central Park--I would take pictures of abandoned buildings and garbage in the streets. You see, I wanted to capture something \"real.\" I was, in other words, a pretentious little twerp.\n\nTo a certain extent, so is John L. Sullivan, though I defy you not to fall in love him by the end of this film (and not just because he was played by the--ahem--not exactly unattractive Joel McCrea). He's a privileged Hollywood director whose past credits mainly include lowbrow comedies, but he yearns to do something more meaningful. So he decides to go on the road disguised as a hobo, though the real rail-riders are able to spot the clueless amateur from a mile away.\n\nSullivan's journey takes him in gradually expanding concentric circles. At first, even his best efforts land him right back in Hollywood, and he can't seem to shake the coterie of publicists and caretakers that are always trailing two inches behind him. He even finds himself with an additional hanger-on, a failed starlet played with a sharp, worldly-wise sensibility by Veronica Lake. Eventually, though, Sullivan really does find himself far away from home and in deep trouble. It's one thing to sleep in shelters and rail cars when you know you can always return to your cushy home base; it's quite another when there's no way to escape the cruelties faced by the truly destitute. At this point the film suspends its comedic tone, though comedy will end up playing a crucial role at this dark moment in Sully's life. \n\nIn the process, he becomes a better man. Sully may have had the best intentions when setting out on his journey, but his utter cluelessness would have made him a pretty unworthy spokesperson for the poor. After getting a taste of what it truly means to suffer, he realizes that the way he can best serve those with nothing is not to wring tears from moviegoers on their behalf, but to lessen their burden a little by making them smile. \n\nI hope I haven't been too ponderous about what really is a fantastically funny film, the definition of G.K. Chesterton's quote \"Angels fly because they take themselves lightly.\" I guess that earnest ponderousness is a habit I still find hard to break. Hopefully a few more viewings of Preston Sturges' masterpiece will set me straight.",

Years after this masterpiece, as age caught up with the two stars, McCrea, now too old to play the leading man, would be successfully recast in a series of westerns and actually enjoyed a second career as a cowpoke. No such luck for Lake. Once considered one of the sexiest stars in Hollywood, she continued with a bunch of \"filmes noire\" for a spell, but within a decade her career had fizzled. Late in life she did a series of interviews saying that of all the sex goddesses of the era, her portrayal was the most effortless, she merely needed to \"brush her hair a certain way\" and men, dumb as they were, practically swooned. (Not entirely true. She had a naturally coarse voice which was unusual, and sexy, in that era; and she did indeed have the figure of a sex goddess, as the very very brief shower scene in Sullivans Travels reveals.) OK, back to 1941. With both stars pretty at the apex of their careers, here is the kind of story that Hollywood does best, a story of the rich vs. the poor, and the problems that can arise trying to reconcile the two. McCrea is pitch perfect as the idealistic rich guy (film producer) trying to see the world through the eyes of the downtrodden, and Lake is pitch perfect as the beautiful, cynical, babe who tags along for the ride whether McCrea likes it or not. The ending, which involves McCrea on a chain gang reading about his own death, is a masterstroke, and unforgettable in its own right. A must see.",

                "text": "This film may be thought of as a talkie version of Chaplin's repeatedly winning combination of pathos and comedy in the adventures of his silent 'Little Tramp' character, which often included an association with a poor, but virtuous, girl. The two films mentioned in my title are not Chaplin films. Rather, they are talkies from the mid-30s that separately illustrate the two dominant features of this film: 1) A wealthy privileged person suddenly must cope with the daily survival realities and prejudices against the very poor and unemployed, 2) a serendipitous meeting of a man and beautiful woman, who get to know each other and fall in love while on an eccentric odyssey, with occasional humorous incidents. During much of this odyssey, involving Sullivan(Joel McCrea) and 'The Girl'(Veronica Lake), she is heavily dressed, with cap, supposedly masquerading as a boy(she was short), as there are no other women in the places frequented by tramps where they will go(But as Sullivan quips, her beautiful face will easily give her away!). The film also exposes the brutality of the chain gang institution, as did the prior Muni-starring \"I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang\" and the later Newman-starring \"Cool Hand Luke\".(Did California have chain gangs?)\n\nThere are occasional incidents of physical humor, such as the obstacles encountered when Sullivan escapes out the window of his new boarding house, and several unplanned dunkings in his backyard swimming pool, but much of the humor relates to a series of ironies, along with the verbal exchanges and deceptions between Sullivan and 'The Girl'.Here are some examples of these ironies: 1)Sullivan is temporarily jailed for stealing his own car(His car vanished when he wasn't supposed to be around) 2)The truck he gets a ride in took him back to Hollywood, where he didn't want to go, but this resulted in his meeting his soul mate:'The Girl'. 3)While handing out $5. bills to random tramps, one recipient gets greedy and robs Sullivan of his remaining bills. 4)This tramp, who knocked Sullivan out, robbed him and stuffed him in an empty boxcar, ended up being run over by a train while he tried to collect the scattered bills he dropped on the tracks. 5)The body of this killed tramp is assumed to be that of Sullivan, since Sullivan's shoes are found on him and Sullivan can't be found 6)Sullivan, the victim of an assault and robbery, is subject to abuse by a rail yard employee while still disoriented, and given a long prison sentence for fighting back 7)Sullivan is not recognized by the court as such, because he can't remember his name and has no ID on him, having been robbed. 8)An all African American church congregation welcomes the all white chain gang as being 'those less fortunate than us' 9)Sullivan has to confess to being his own murder in order to attract attention to himself as an inmate on a chain gang 10)Sullivan finally gets a good excuse to divorce his estranged wife as a result of his presumed death and imprisonment, when she marries his crooked business manager, who engineered their marriage. Then, he will be free to marry 'The Girl'. 11) After seeing how his fellow inmates laughed at the cartoons hosted by the church, he abandons his ambition to direct a film about the dispossessed, in favor of yet another comedy, as apparently being more important to humanity.\n\nQuestion: Why is Veronica never given a name other than 'The Girl'? Perhaps to add to her natural mystique? Question:Why didn't the chain gang include African Americans and Latinos? Question:Why did the chain gang enter an all African American church to see cartoons? I suspect this was meant to contrast their treatment of down and out whites with that of the white establishment. Question: Why was Sullivan freed from his chain gang once his identity is recognized? Presumably, his status as a wealthy famous person, rather than an apparently mentally ill hobo, has induced the court to reclassify his assault on the rail yard employee as retaliatory self-defense.\n\nMcCrea was perfect for the part of Sullivan, as he should have been, the role having been written with him in mind.(Cooper would also have been great.) Several actresses were considered for 'The Girl'. Barbara Stanwyck had costarred with McCrea in \"Union Pacific\", but was no longer a spring chicken. Francis Farmer was also considered. Veronica was much younger than those ladies, but was 6 months pregnant, although she failed to inform the director until after she was chosen! Nonetheless, she worked out quite well, coming across as innocently appealing, with her long lustrous peekaboo blond hair, rather dead pan typical expression, and typical shy, if sometimes teasing, demeanor. She seemed to have great chemistry with McCrea. Unfortunately, McCrea, like many others, found her personality difficult, and declined to do another film with her. It's clear that Veronica had some mental health issues throughout her life, being diagnosed as a child with schizophrenia, and dying at an early age from the effects of alcoholism.",

                "text": "\"Sullivan's Travels\" is often held up as director Preston Sturges' peak moment at blending comedy and drama, but to my lights it strains at the significance of his better work. You laugh, you feel sympathy, but you can't help feel manipulated, too.\n\nDirector John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) has a number of hit films to his credit, including a recent dramatic potboiler which is killing them in New York but died in Pittsburgh. His producers encourage him to go back to the light comedies and musicals that brought him broader box-office success. But Sullivan is a man on a mission, to shed a light on humanity's plight \"with grim death gargling at every corner.\" Dressed as a hobo, he sets out to discover real suffering.\n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" is a curiously uneven film structurally and stylistically. Sturges starts out making a knockabout comedy, with much flopping around and less wit than usual (Sully's response about Pittsburgh audiences being his one funny line). McCrea is overbearingly serious, in a way that might have played as send-up with a more comic actor in the role. Here he comes off as insufferable. Sturges pushes the angst, especially near the end when we suddenly leave the world of screwball comedy for \"I Was A Fugitive On A Chain Gang.\"\n\nNo, this film doesn't put Sturges back with the shipping news, but it's not much fun. What works in the film is in part its slapdash energy and whirl of familiar Sturges faces, but mostly Veronica Lake, playing a character known only as the Girl or \"the kid\" (a nod to Chaplin; she even resembles Jackie Coogan standing next to the lanky McCrea in hobo dress and an over-sized flat cap.) She bites off her lines with casual flair and does what she can to puncture the pomposity around her, the sort of thing you can count on Sturges doing in his other, better films.\n\n\"Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known,\" Sullivan tells her. \"You take a picture like 'Hold Back Tomorrow'...\"\n\n\"You hold it,\" she snaps back.\n\nApart from fair Veronica, there's not much else to see. So much of the comedy seen early on is of the groaner variety, like McCrea falling into haystacks (twice) and a rain barrel. Sturges regular William Demerest even gets stuck with a gin rummy/I don't drink exchange, punctuated by an Edgar Kennedy slow burn. By the time we see Sully and the girl push each other into a pool, you almost want the film to stop trying to be so forcedly merry. Until it does, whereupon we get more pontificating from Sullivan about what it all means.\n\nThe film snaps into better shape at the end. There's a terrific scene set in a black church which brings out some needed humanity, as well as one of the few times I can see a '40s film featuring black actors that doesn't make me wince in shame. The resolution is fine, too, especially a delirious scene featuring Lake in a hoop skirt.\n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" has just enough going for it to make it pleasant, and even, occasionally, worthy of its lofty aim of celebrating mirth for mirth's sake. Sturges' films famously benefit from multiple viewings, and maybe for me the fifth time will be the charm. Alas, to these tired eyes, it comes off more as sermon than Sennett, one of those classic films movie critics love because it's about the movies, rather than a movie worth loving.",

When Sullivan goes to prison, he finds himself up close with what he (and we) would normally regard as 'the dregs of society', but he (and we) are touched by their honesty and simple pleasure, and their acceptance of their place in the world. The Church scene in which a simple children's' cartoon brings out the convicts' laughter and joy - despite their terrible existence - is deeply moving. It would be very easy to mistake this film for an early Frank Capra ('You can't take it with you'/'It's a Wonderful Life') The final line is the cue to finally admit that yes, there are tears in your eyes and reach for the handkerchief: \"I want to make people laugh.

Anybody can have an opinion, but when people like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert place this film in their best 20 list, there must be a reason.  First, Preston Sturgis, a genius, they even named a building after him on the Paramount Studio Lot.  Seven big hit films in seven years, plus he had a giant reputation as a Broadway playwright. Although some may disagree, I think this film was his masterpiece. The scene in the poor black church, where the convicts go in shackles is so brilliant, it ranks with some of the best filmmaking on the planet. I've heard people say it was stereotypical, yet unfortunately, that's the way it was then.  The juxtaposition of the convicts, who had lost their civil rights, and the poor African Americans who never had civil rights, mated to the song, \"Let My People Go\", puts this film heads and shoulders against anything anybody was doing in 1942.\n\nJoel McCrea gives the performance of his career. I fell totally in love with Veronica Lake; who wouldn't?  The first scene lasts five minutes without a cut.

It was odd seeing some of these people in natural sunlight. I was always accustomed to all films made before the 1960s were filmed inside in a studio and had that \"un-natural light\" look about them.\n\nIt's also interesting to how movies were made back then and now. From a book on this movie's script it says Preston Sturges wrote the screenplay from February 1941 to April 1941. Filming began in May and lasted until July. The finished film premiered in January 1942. That's very fast. From beginning to end in about 11 months! \n\nThe book also mentions some scenes that were taken out: One where Veronica Lake's character sits sadly on a bench near the grave of John Sullivan, the leading character who she believes is dead. They should have left that scene in; it helps again show the honest affection her character had toward John Sullivan.\n\nI like the combination of Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake and out of all the attractive leading ladies over the past say 70 years, Veronica's looks have aged very well.

However, director Sturges took a real chance by shifting gears into dark melodrama of the prison farm. On the whole, it works without too many seams showing. \n\nFrankly, the Veronica Lake role appears unnecessary. But her star was rising and was no doubt a big marquee plus. At the same time, seeing McCrea in this cosmopolitan role takes some getting used to if you're used to his laconic westerns. Still, he does well enough. And whose burst of inspiration was the Black minister and congregation, plus the poignant gospel number, Go Down Moses. Catch the hymn's refrain about \"letting my people go\". In the movie's context, that suggests the Blacks are imprisoned as much as the convicts, even if within a different kind of prison. \n\nStill, I'm not sure I agree with the movie's overall message. Of course, comedy and laughter are especially important to the aggrieved and downtrodden. Still, social message films can provide hope and inspiration for those who actually need to change onerous conditions. Trouble is that director Sullivan renounces protest films in favor of comedy, and that strikes me as a retreat into easy commercialism. However, that probably suited movie industry's interests in not rocking the political boat. Anyway, this observation aside, the movie remains an effective combination of comedy, drama and societal expose.",

The film follows John L. Sullivan a successful director of 'fluff' comedy films such as Ants in their pants of 1941 (a slight dig at gold diggers of 1933), who is tired of making the same meaningless films. Sullivan gets the crazy idea that he must leave his pampered upbringing and extravagant lifestyle to experience the hardships of the everyday man during the depression. To his producers dismay he goes ahead with the plan and gets into all kinds of fixes and mayhem along the way. On his travels he meets a stunning young actress played by Veronica Lake, who sadly is a very limited actress in real life and is no more then a pair of legs. The story keeps you entertained throughout and has it's twists near the end that are done quit well. Joel McCrea gives a solid performance as Sullivan, even if it is a bit wooden at times. Strurges does his best to replicate a Frank Capra film towards the end with his whole power of laughter message which felt a bit rushed too be honest. But all in all Sullivan's Travels is a very good lighthearted comedy, that is superbly written. But with too many flaws and not a strong enough cast to be deemed a true 'classic'. 7/10",

                "text": "Going from nothing to AFI's top 100 in 2007, Sullivan's Travels is an achievement in cinema worth the recognition. The film is about a comedy director named Sullivan who wants to make a dramatic film about poverty, but having no experience with it, goes out as a tramp with only 10 cents. Everyone warns him of the misguided nature of that experiment; eventually he runs into a down-on-her-luck girl (Veronica Lake) who accompanies him.\n\nAt first a light comedy with plenty of wit and enjoyable physical humour, Sullivan's Travels admires the commentary films can make on social systems. Sullivan praises a film symbolizing capitalism and labour destroying each other, and wants to make a film like it. It also explores, fairly extensively, how the rich can sympathize for the poor not knowing what the conditions are actually like. The butler condemns such rich people as morbid for glamourizing poverty. Sullivan, in fact, has great difficulty really getting into the feel of it, as he keeps ending up back in Hollywood, back at his mansion, back in the hands of his staff. He receives some sympathy he doesn't need. He asks tramps how they feel about the labour situation (how are they supposed to feel about it?). When Lake pushes him into the pool, one feels he deserves it.\n\nThat's until the last third of the film, which turns much darker. After Sullivan is robbed and knocked out by the only villainous poor person in the film, he, in a dazed state, hits a railroad worker with a rock and goes to prison. No one knows who he is. Now he's really facing harsh reality, beaten, in chains, unable to access the quality defence he needs. When he, fellow-prisoners and a black congregation watch a comedy film in a church, Sullivan sees first-hand what comedy can give these people. Once let out, he goes back to making comedies- everything's come full-circle, but now he has more purpose than ever.\n\nThis is a movie that adeptly balances comedy and drama, to examine comedy and drama. Two things particularly stand out- one is Lake, with her sultry voice and jaded character which are simply irresistible. The other is the scene in the church, where comedy unites and uplifts the downtrodden. This is movie magic.",

Sullivan thought he did and looked for proof. But the rich only think they do. That discovery was the adventure of Sullivan. He learned his lesson the hard way and what the lesson thought him was not what he expected.\n\nA good concept for starters. Considering the year it was produced, and the rudimentary modus operandi in making the film, I had to rethink my evaluation perspective. In that period, the producers and directors had writers work in creative assembly process; an abundance of dialogue was written and directors used it as raw material to tell the story and to create the characters. Sadly, if a substantial portion of the dialogues had been cut to leave only the clever parts in, the ones that did convey the characters' personalities, their strong and weaker traits, what makes an actor believable, we would be closer to the better character development processes of today. The rest of the dialogue, what parts convey the environment in which takes place the story, would today, also, be scaled back and the cinematographers (their skills were just starting to develop) would use the script now with parts geared to the story's environment, in conjunction with set and special effects specialist (they were honing their own skills as well then). All this considered, I enjoyed many many parts of the dialogue, to be specific, the repartee ones.\n\nI was happy to get a sense of production and direction in that era, so I can better appreciate what we see from movie makers around the world and from time to time from Hollywood, nowadays. I like to think the templates of many scenes in movies of subsequent decades, including even today, had started being developed in those days. I was okay with the movie as a whole; thought it did a good job with a fair story and the lead actors, Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake acquitted themselves very well for a 1941 movie. I certainly don't expect any of you will be interested in seeing the movie, if you can even find a copy, nor would I be so presumptuous to think you have the time to do so, just because I suggest it. Considering the very high ratings on record from both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, and that it is a movie enthusiast and educators like to use as reference, you had from the user reviews, mine and others, information to help you keep up any conversation on the subject.",

Joel McCrea, in probably the best role of his career, plays Sullivan, a successful director with pretensions, who dreams of creating a socially relevant masterpiece on the back of a string of inane comedies such as Ant in Your Pants of 1939. Discouraged by his studio bosses, McCrea dresses himself as a tramp and attempts to sample life on the road with mostly disappointing results, although he does manage to hook up with the sultry Veronica Lake on the way.\n\nSullivan's good intentions land him a six year spell on the chain gang when, having decided he has seen all he needs to see of the life of the poor, he is mugged while dispensing five dollar notes and, as a result of the only part of the film that doesn't really ring true, finds himself doing time on a chain gang. Ironically, he finds exactly the kind of experience he thought he wanted, only to discover that he is trapped in that world \u0096 until he acknowledges who he really is and what he's really about. On the way, he learns, during a church screening of a Pluto cartoon, that comedy has an important place in the lives of the poor against which a social conscience can never compete.\n\nI remember seeing a BBC news report some years ago in which a group of well-meaning but misguided celebrities led by actor Jeremy Irons were sleeping rough for a night to highlight the plight of the homeless. Trouble was, poor old Jeremy couldn't get any sleep because he was harangued by the real homeless who were outraged at he and his pals patronising efforts to salve their own social consciences. They knew that the following night Mr Irons would be surrounded by the comforts of his millionaire lifestyle while they would once again be bedding down in the shop doorways of London, and that Irons' publicity stunt would only succeed in, well, gaining some positive publicity for Irons and his friends. It was one of the funniest things I'd seen in years. Irons obviously hadn't seen this film, or considered how the real homeless might respond to his hollow gesture. Some worlds, as Sullivan finds out to his cost in this movie, are never meant to collide.\n\nSturges was a unique talent and his brand of humour ranges from cartoon-ish slapstick to highly-barbed suggestion, all of which is displayed here. This was arguably his finest moment, and much of the comedy is as fresh and laugh-out-loud funny today as it must have been back in the early forties. There are only two drawbacks: the presence of Veronica Lake, a limited actress who delivers too many of her lines in a monotone that is really too distracting, and the way Sturges has to unrealistically compress and twist the story's timeline once Sturges is robbed of his conscience money.",

Look for Franklin Pangborn, Eric Blore, and William Demarest, too.\n\nIt's a story based on a successful director's unhappiness with his success, so he sets out to bum around America in a search for real life. The director, named Sullivan, plans on making a movie called \"O Brother Where Art Thou,\" and if you've seen that movie (by the Coens), you'll recognize the chain gang scene in \"Sullivan's Travels.\" \n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" could have been a typical \"Common Man\" movie of the Depression Era, but something brings it up a notch. McCrea is excellent, and the script (by Sturges) refuses to show common men as noble brutes and stereotypes. I can see why the Coen Brothers called their insane take off of The Odyssey \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" and paid homage to \"Sullivan's Travels.\" There never has been a Common Man.\n\nAs with \"The Lady Eve,\" Sturges here is relentless in his comedy, but \"Sullivan's Travels\" has more of an edge as Sturges contrasts wealthy studio execs with working class stiffs in the real America. Naturally for Sullivan, everything that can go wrong does, he ends up in prison, then gets the girl. But pay attention. Sturges pays respect to the underclasses as few other directors did during the Thirties and early Forties.\n\nIf you want to see the glorification of the Common Man, watch Gary Cooper in \"Meet John Doe\" (or just about any other Frank Capra movie). If you want to see another Sturges movie and like screwball comedies, see \"The Lady Eve\" with Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck (and Blore and Demarest). And if you haven't seen \"O Brother Where Art Thou,\" by the Coen Brothers, be sure to.\n\nNOTE: Eric Blore's death caused the funniest situation I've ever heard of regarding a death. An article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine referred to \"the late Eric Blore.\" Blore's lawyer wrote in advising that the report was premature and asking for a correction. \"The New Yorker\" was famous for its accuracy, and this was it's first correction ever. Ever. The author of the article wrote an apology which was prepared for the next issue, printed and ready for delivery on a Monday. Blore died Sunday night.

He'll become a sociologist of poverty. He'll dress like a 'Bo and go amongst them with only a few dollars and a studio ID card hidden in his shoe. Well, the Suits plunge into a state of complete frenzy. Their most profitable director prowling around among the soup kitchens and Hoovervilles. Even the servants in his millionaire's aerie advise against it. \"Poverty, sir, is an abomination. It is to be shunned!\" But it's no use. McRea hits the road with his bindle over his shoulder, but the Suits insist on a huge bus following him as he walks along the highway. Twenty yards or so behind him is this Land Cruiser full of bodyguards, secretaries, valets, and cooks. (That's my kind of field work.) McRea tries to lose them by hitching a ride with a 13-year-old boy driving a souped-up \"Wupper Tank.\" The speedometer is painted on the wooden dashboard and reads a constant 130 miles per hour. The Wupper Tank takes off, followed by the speeding, lumbering bus and its passengers. The pursuit takes both vehicles off the road and over hill and dale. You've seen this kind of low comedy before -- from the Keystone Kops to \"The Long, Long Trailer\" -- but you will never have laughed quite so hard before.\n\nAfter that the humor returns to the quietly ironic. Somewhere along the way, McRea picks up Veronica Lake, a starlet manque who is fleeing Hollywood. They hop onto a freight train along with dozens of other vagrants and when they hop off they find themselves back in Hollywood.\n\nTowards the end of his picaresque peregrinations -- the title of course is from Swift's satire, \"Gulliver's Travels\" -- McRea and Lake decide they've explored the dark alleys of poverty long enough and joyfully return to his swimming pool. As a last act of generosity towards those who have taught him so much, McRea returns to the alleys of hobos and distributes several thousand dollars, one hundred at a time, to the amazed bums. This is a big mistake. One of the scummier ones follows him, bops him on the head, and runs off with the money. When he's run over by a train, his body is mistaken for that of Sullivan.\n\nSullivan wakes up in a daze, stumbles off a box car, beans a yard cop, and is sentenced to six years on a chain gang. He sasses the boss, just like Cool Hand Luke, and is deprived of such privileges as phone calls or letters, so no one knows he's alive. Now begins his real schooling, and what he learns is that poor people don't want to see their own misery reflected on the screen. They want the only good they can afford, the laughter of comedy.\n\nThat ending has been pounded by critics as a sell out but I don't know what else the writer/director Preston Sturges could have done. Any other ending would have been bleak enough to make the movie unalterably tragic.\n\nAt that, I don't really think the obvious moral is the one Sturges intended. He was never that frothy. Delete the last five minutes and what you have is a simple lesson: there's good and bad in every square inch of social space. Humans of all types are imperfect and sometimes those imperfections -- naivete, greed, infatuation -- lead to unexpected consequences, whether joyous or painful. The Suits are clearly greedy, but being poor doesn't necessarily make you a hero.\n\nThis is one of the better comedies in a decade that was full of good comedies, and Preston Sturges was responsible for a number of them.",

Normally I don't look for a message to be included in screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, but in this case I appreciated it. Sturges points out, in a time of world turmoil, that there is nothing wrong with enjoying yourself; and he does this beautifully, with one simple scene near the end. \"Sullivan's Travels\" fits in with his body of work in every other way, however. The rapid fire dialogue, double entendres, and hilarious physical comedy remain static. Joel McCrea, who, based on his performance in \"Sullivan\", was certainly a big inspiration for Tim Robbins' performance in another Coen brother's film, \"The Hudsucker Proxy\", was a wonderful, earnest dope that had every good intention, but just needed a swift kick to execute his ideas. Veronica Lake was a great surprise for me, since I am so used to seeing her as a femme fatale in noir films. Her funny, very physical performance was extremely enjoyable that really added to the charm of the film.\n\nAs stated earlier, I have now seen three Sturges films, and with each film I see I want to see more. \"Sullivan's Travels\" was not flawless, it did have some pacing issues, but it was a truly enjoyable film that was so charming it is easy to forgive the small stuff. This film is highly recommended for any classic film fan, or comedy fan. I would also recommend it to anyone who, like me, are big Coen brothers fans \u0096 Sturges was a big influence on them, and so far, \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the clearest example of this. 7/10 --Shelly",

Sturges was past master at combining slapstick with pointed satire, and occasionally the two with elements of drama, as the writer/director did in Hail the Conquering Hero and The Great McGinty, in particular.\n\nRegrettably, here in Sullivan's Travels, the mood swings too wildly. The high speed, topsy-turvy, farcical comedy scenes whether at the beginning or the end of the film are too ridiculous, while the social-realist dramatic sequence of Sullivan's courtroom sentencing, his sufferings on the prison farm, and his final gospel chapel epiphany goes from bleak to bizarre. The crowning moment of the film -- which is reprised over the last fadeout -- is the hysterical laughter of the convicts and the churchgoers as they watch a Mickey Mouse and Pluto cartoon. Perhaps this moment worked in 1941, but now the laughter seems demented and the whole episode is unsettling. Whenever I see this scene, I always think of the braying of gloating capitalists in some Soviet propaganda reel.\n\nSturges apparently took his inspiration from Gulliver's Travels, moulding the name of Jonathan Swift's lead character into his own: \"Sullivan\". Gulliver, in his travels, starts off in Lilliput and ends up in the land of the Houyhnhnms, with the tone descending from farce into tragedy along the way. Sullivan's journey takes the same route. Swift was able to achieve his intentions with great effect. Sturges can be praised for his audacity in trying to accomplish the same feat. His place as one of the greatest American film-makers is still secure.",

This time it is because, believe it or not, we hadn't seen it until yesterday, 11/28/14, on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nTHE STORY STARTS out with a basic premise. Wealthy Hollywood Director, John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McRea)sets out to truly see how the other half lives by masquerading as a vagrant. Wherever he goes, there is always he extensive support staff in traveling \"studio\"; being a deluxe camper. It appears that this hobo is a rich one.\n\nALTHOUGH SO MUCH of the story is full of Writer/Director Preston Sturges' caustic humour and accompanying sought-gags, th story turns very dark at midway point. It happens that due to a mistaken identity, Director Sullivan is thought to have been killed. He winds up in a Southern prison chain-gang, at which point he appears to be at the real low point of his odyssey.\n\nIT IS DURING this stay behind bars that he has his true epiphany. A Congregation and Pastor of a Negro Church invites the prisoners and jailers of the Chain Gang to be their guests a the showing of Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE & PLUTO Cartoon. The uninhibited laughter that permeates all in attendance proves to Sullivan that it is this merriment that is a universal cure to so many ills of the world. He decides that the next movie will be a comedy.\n\nBESIDE THE FINE writing and direction by Mr. Sturges, we are treated to the rarity of such a powerful and talented cast. Besides Joel McRea, we have names like: Veronica Lake, Robert Warwick, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, Porter Hall, Byron Foulger and Richard Webb.\n\nWE MUST CONFESS that our favourite gag involves the widow (Estelle Howard) who hires \"vagrant\" Sulivan to do chores around her house, all the while planning to 6turn him into her own, private \"Boy Toy\". This is explicit and very bold for 1941.\n\nIN CONCLUSION, IT appears that Mr. Sturges had a real concern for those less fortunate; but he makes no plea for any sort of socialistic remedies. His approach is more in line with the more personal, heart felt and Christian way.",

Yes, occasionally it gets a little slow and over-serious in the middle but Sturges is trying to out over some serious points about caring capitalism, in particular society's outlook towards the poor, the incarcerated and blacks and can be forgiven for occasionally dotting the \"i's\" and crossing the \"t's\" with his crusading zeal.\n\nIt starts paradoxically with an ending, an allegorical fight to the death between capital and labour, as luridly directed by what we'd today call a rom-con director of hit movies, played by Joel McCrae, keen to show his serious-side and exercise his social conscience. His bluff is called by his producer and associate who both mock his wish to make a film celebrating the disadvantaged in society and challenge him to live it before he films it. Initially, a film crew is hired to film his every move as he dresses down and seeks to temporarily become a hobo, however with the help of quite literally a boy-racer, he outpaces them and leaves his pursuers in a heap in his wake. So far, so typical screwball-comedy.\n\nHowever, as the slapstick and wisecracking are more or less gradually moved out the way, Sturges vision grows darker with McCrae finally thinking he's on a level with his subject and ready to film it, until real-life events, in the form of a crack on the head from a greedy tramp who robs him while he's in the act of patronisingly distributing largesse to the local down-and-outs, which sees him end up convicted of his own \"death\" and condemned to hard labour on the chain- gang. Of course he eventually extricates himself from his plight but chastened by his experience, he eschews the moribund preachy fable in favour of the light comedies to the better lift spirits.\n\nMcCrae is excellent in the lead role and gets a great foil in his travels with the diminutive Veronica Lake in a breakthrough role as the hard-bitten wannabe actress who likewise forgoes her relative comfort and privilege to join him on his walk on the wild side. They make a fine pairing which really is the long and the short of it. Behind them are Sturges' crew of stock actors, giving able and intuitive support. Sturges' direction is frequently imaginative and occasionally gets the pacing wrong but his central moral of charity and brotherhood emerge intact by the end of this warming and disarming feature.",

Basically popular young Hollywood director John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is tired of directing comedies and wants to make something serious, exploration of the plight of the downtrodden based on the book O Brother, Where Art Thou?, but Mr. LeBrand (Robert Warwick) wants him to direct another lucrative comedy. Sullivan refuses to give in and decides to experience himself what the life for a tramp is like and truly depict the sorrows, his butler Burroughs (Robert Greig) and Valet (Top Hat's Eric Blore) question his idea, ignoring them he dresses as a penniless hobo and goes on the road, but no matter what he does he ends up back in Hollywood, he is even trailed by staff who try to bring back, even hitchhiking he ends back where he started. Then he meets The Girl (Veronica Lake), a young failed actress who is considering quitting the business, having shown him kindness he gives her a lift in his car, the servants wrongly assume the car has been stolen, following a short stint being apprehended she pushes him in a swimming pool for lying to her about who he is, but she forgives him and becomes his travelling companion. Sullivan finally manages to live like a real hobo, eating in soup kitchens and sleeping in homeless shelters with the Girl, he eventually decides to call it a day, his experiment has been successful, the Girl wants to stay with him, but advised by his business manager he explains is already married to reduce tax payments, but she has cost him double the money to get by. As he is getting ready to leave and giving homeless people $5 bills Sullivan is ambushed while alone by a homeless man who wants more money, the man knocks him unconscious and thrown onto a train boxcar leaving the city, but the thief is killed being run over by another train, he also stole Sullivan's shoes which contained identification, and everyone assumes the unrecognisable body is that of Sullivan. In another city Sullivan has woken up and has no memory of what happened or who he is, and when he assaults a railroad worker who found him he is sentenced to six years in a labour camp, and there he remembers everything, but before he will do anything to get his life back he learns the importance of laughter when the the prisoners are cheered up watching a cartoon, he knows comedy helps those less fortunate. Sullivan cannot convince the prison staff of his identity, but he comes up with the idea to confess to murdering John Lloyd Sullivan to make headlines and get his photograph in the papers, he is recognised and released, and he and the Girl reunite, and he is allowed to divorce as his \"widow\" went with a crooked business manager, the last moments are various laughing faces. Also starring William Demarest as Mr. Jones, Franklin Pangborn as Mr. Casalsis, Porter Hall as Mr. Hadrian, Arthur Hoyt as Preacher at Revival Mission and Preston Sturges as Studio Director. McCrea gives an amiable performance as the director who goes to unusual lengths to research for a new film, and it is understandable why Lake become a star after this film with her lavish long blonde hair being seductive, this film really a sideways look at both the Hollywood system and how losing everything can affect people, so it is both entertaining and thoughtful, there are just about enough funny moments but I found it more dramatic than anything, which is a good thing, a most watchable satirical comedy drama.

Film director Joel McCrea is disgusted by what he sees as a curable disease of mankind and society and decides to head out disguised as a hobo (stalked by his butler and valet) to find out their real issues and plan a new epic to document their struggles in a world of denial. Along the way, he meets a beautiful but broke movie extra (Veronica Lake) on the verge of leaving Hollywood. She buys him ham and eggs (fooled by his disguise) then is disgusted when she discovers the truth. On his own, McCrea fights off lonely widows, finds some sympathy but ultimately ends up in a work camp, a victim of amnesia who assaults a train officer in self-defense. The camp's sadistic guard cruelly taunts him and all seems lost until the amnesiac McCrea sees the other inmates laughing at a Mickey Mouse cartoon and realizes what people needs is laughter rather than a reminder of things that they already know.\n\nAlthough the plot is wrapped up rather quickly and a bit too neatly, it is still a satisfying conclusion. Writer and Director Preston Sturges acknowledges the Capra like structure of the plot, and like Capra, utilizes a strong core of character actors, most notably Eric Blore as the valet, Robert Greig as the butler, Esther Howard as the love-starved widow, Almira Sessions as the prickly housekeeper and Jimmy Conlin as the kindly trustee at the work farm. While the first half of the film offers a light-hearted view of the hobo's life as total freedom from the pressures of society, the last half is a lot darker and thus more profound. In many ways, it reminded me of a later version of \"Wild Boys of the Road\", a 1933 movie about lost youth trying to find themselves in a world torn asunder by depression.",

Even though there was some playful interplay between the two, I never got the impression that Sullivan was ever trying to take advantage of 'The Girl's' youth and inexperience. I would add naivet\u00e9 as well, but Lake's character never really came across as naive, having been around the block in her quest to become an actress. This was an interesting role for Lake, a screen siren of the era who's better remembered for roles like Cora Smith in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". I thought she cut the cutest tomboy figure dressed as a hobo, at the same time drawing viewer attention to the significant difference in height between herself and McCrae as they navigated the hobo jungles.\n\nSullivan's 'come to Jesus' moment comes in a 'come to Jesus' setting when as a prisoner on a chain gang, he gets to watch a Disney cartoon at a Baptist revival gathering. The setting itself is a jarring juxtaposition of humanity, a poor black congregation offering their hospitality to a group of convicts whose only relief from brutal incarceration is the infrequent attendance at a local 'picture show'. Sullivan's observation and analysis brings him full circle to the quandary he was faced with at the start of the film, and is led to the conclusion that in difficult times, it's better to make people laugh. I don't know that I'd always agree with that, but for the purpose of this picture's message, it works pretty well.\n\nIf you're intrigued by the hobo life as depicted in the middle part of this picture, I would direct you to the 1933 film \"Wild Boys of the Road\". It's a grittier film that ST, while blending some hefty doses of grim reality with spirit and humanity.

The dark and light, the high and low, the rich and poor, black and white, love and divorce, life and death and all those wonderful opposing pairs of contradictions in the narrative that really reflect the very fabric of human existence find a eureka moment in a scene in a church where criminals in chains, men of god, common folk, men, women, strangers and children find something common to laugh at; Disney's MICKEY MOUSE. \"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.

It's not revealed with the most impressiveness, but few themes ring as true as this film's, especially to anyone with a love of the movies, especially classics.\n\nConceived during the Great Depression and premiering at the very beginning of World War II, what an important picture. \"Sullivan\" champions comedy, portrays Hollywood with a sense of humor yet asks it to look in the mirror and celebrates the golden age of Hollywood that came before it with numerous classic techniques.\n\nJohn McCrea is John Lloyd Sullivan, a pictures director that wants to make a film of substance -- he wants to adapt \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" (a title most cleverly used by the Coen brothers in their 2000 film) but his producers want ... a little bit of sex. They tell him he knows nothing of human suffering and has no business making that kind of film. Sullivan sees it as a challenge and decides he'll dress like a hobo and learn for himself in order to make his picture.\n\nTry as he might to escape his Hollywood entourage, the humor of \"Sullivan\" is that Sullivan can never manage to escape Los Angeles. In the beginning he tries to shake them in a high- speed chase one of the funnier and more classic scenes of the film. He's in a go-kart of sorts with a 13-year-old and his friends in a giant caravan.\n\nAlong the way he meets a girl (Veronica Lake) who shows him some kindness and then when they're thrown in jail and bailed out by his producers, he reveals himself rather quickly. She takes a liking to him, however, and they dress as hobos together jumping on train cars the next time out.\n\nThe brilliance of Preston Sturges' story and script -- aside from his punchy dialogue -- is that despite it's sincere message, it is not a drama about a guy trying to make a drama after years of comedies, but it's a comedy. It's not the funniest thing you ever saw and it hits you right over the head with just about everything instead of drawing it out and making it a bit more epiphanic, but it serves up a pristine reminder of what it's about through use of the comedic techniques it champions.\n\nIf you love film -- namely the classics -- \"Sullivan's Travels\" will find a way to your heart somehow. It's a really perceptive film for 1941, a genre rarity in those days truthfully, and it celebrates what at least one genre of film is all about.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

                "text": "Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a director of comedies, but he wants to make a film with social significance. To get inspired, he ventures out into the world as a hobo, with only ten cents to his name. Although he tries repeatedly, his adventures continue to fail... until one day he gets in over his head.\n\nThe director of this film, Preston Sturges, was consistently great, not only hitting a home run here, but also with \"Lady Eve\" and \"The Palm Beach Story\". There is something about his style that brings a sense of fun to the screen and carries a complex plot in an easy to digest manner. From the very beginning, we are treated with a \"communism\" (or perhaps Christian) message about the needs of mankind, and this is blended into a great action introduction -- among the most action you will see in a film of this period, in fact.\n\nWe have some great stars -- Veronica Lake, who is a delightfully beautiful leading lady. And Eric Blore, the gay Englishman from \"Lady Eve\" and \"Top Hat\" is enjoyable in each of his roles... though this one was much smaller, sadly. And we have the ongoing influence of Sullivan's proposed movie, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" that had to wait several decades before finally being made by the Coens.\n\nThe comedy is genius and in some ways ahead of its time. For example, the \"black chef\" scene is hilarious, and seems to anticipate Lucille Ball, particularly \"The Long, Long Trailer\". There are also some very conspicuous nods to Ernst Lubitsch, which is wonderful. Lubitsch is not well known outside cinephile circles, but he had such a huge impact on Sturges and Billy Wilder, among countless others.\n\nOne of the big questions of this film is whether laughter is what the poor need or social films. Mysteriously, the story assumes they go to the movies, which seems generally doubtful that the poor and homeless do. But let us run with that assumption: what benefits the poor more, a good laugh or a film that makes people think about the ills of society? Likely the latter, but arguments exist for both, of course.\n\nThe Criterion Collection release has an interesting commentary with Michael McKean, Noah Baumbach and Christopher Guest. They are unfortunately not in the same room during recording, but each has something good to offer. You might be surprised how knowledgeable these men are about a film that is now over seventy years old.",

                "text": "Preston Sturges, in this, his fourth outing as a screenwriter/director, made a movie that not only parodies Hollywood and the eccentrics who inhabit it, but also fashioned a sort of Capresque fable about the human spirit and it's resilience in the face of adversity. The story of the film is very funny, touching and heartwarming, but at the same time it flirts with some serious social subjects such as poverty, escapism and mass-media manipulation.\n\nThe characters start off as typical bigger-than-life stereotypes of the people the tabloids write about all the time, but as the film progresses, they strip themselves of that stage persona that make them a bit hard for an average audience to relate to. They become more ordinary, more real. Their oblivion becomes their opportunity for redemption in a world where redemption isn't really necessary.\n\nSome of the personalities that revolve around the main characters are more cartoonish than others (typical of golden era Hollywood). Take for instance Sullivan's wife-for-hire (Ursula Sessions) and her submissive accountant (or his fast-talking producers, wonderfully played by Robert Warwick and William Demarest), but who really stole my heart was Veronica Lake's character, \"The Girl\", whose antics behind that dirty face and those over-sized \"hobo\" clothes are just about as adorable as those of Diane Keaton in Annie Hall --perhaps even more! (ok, so maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, all right)! But anyway, I wouldn't in a million years have guessed from watching this picture that Lake was such a hard gal to get along with in real life. So difficult she was, that after the filming of \"Sullivan's...\" was completed in 1941, Lloyd refused to work with her ever again. How about that? Now, what's the movie about? John L. Lloyd 'Sully' Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is an established Hollywood film director in the early 1940s. He thinks of his films as profound works of art that have high social and political significance (for all of human kind), but his two studio producers think that his latest film is simply a vehicle for communist propaganda. This makes it hard for Sullivan to convince them of backing up his latest project, \"Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?\", a grim story about poverty and suffering --subjects that his producers do not think are Sully's biggest strengths. They try to convince him of making a \"lighter\", more \"commercial\" picture, Sully adamantly refuses to that idea. After a while, the producers come to the conclusion that, with a little bit of sex and guns here and there, any movie could become a hit. Sullivan agrees (quite unconvinced.) The movie Sullivan wants to make is a go. The producer aren't happy. (Talk about where the hell Altman got a big chunk of his inspiration for \"The Player\"!!) Driven by his desire to make \"Oh, Brother...\" the best and most realistic movie he can make, Sullivan decides to detach himself from his privileges in order to go on a field trip away from sunny California and into the dark alleys of his own tenacity... disguised as a hobo. Hours later, after an attempt to leave Los Angeles in search of misery and all it has to teach him, Sullivan is back in Hollywood due to circumstances he can't quite comprehend. Sitting at a dinner without enough change to buy himself a decent breakfast, he meets a sultry blonde, \"The Girl\", a disappointed aspiring actress on her way out of \"La La Land\", who offers to buy him some \"ham and eggs\". She sits with him. They talk. They eat.. and then... well, then you are on your way to movie heaven! After a couple of hours (in movie time), \"The Girl\" learns all about Sully's scheme to pose as a homeless guy in order to prepare himself to direct his next movie. She then decides to accompany him on his odyssey by disguising herself as another hobo --a very loyal and extremely lovable one in this case (maybe she's thinking of her career at this point--who knows?). They subsequently make several attempts to leave the state of California and scape the studio-hired safety crew that follows them around in a huge mobile home (a doctor and a lawyer included), but they are unsuccessful at it. Sullivan, no matter how much he tries to escape \"Hollywood\", always ends up under the protective comforts of his own good fortune...that is until he decides to take one last venture on his own.\n\nAfter escaping his own house in order to thank all of his former homeless fellow men and women for their wonderful \"kindness\" (merely not minding him or his tom-boy companion) during his rather unsuccessful research trip, nobody hears from Sully again.\n\nSuffice to say that Sullivan, weeks later, ends up on the front page of all the newspapers in town when \"proof\" of his assassination reaches Hollywood. Everyone is outraged. The truth is that he has not been assassinated, but mugged. Unfortunately for him, he ends up unconscious in one of the wagons of a train heading far away from California... heading for real trouble (at last). When he wakes up, confused by not remembering who he is or where he's at, he attacks a security officer, which lands him a sentence of six years in a hard-labor camp.\n\nAt the Labor Camp he regains his memory little by little, but he then can't convince anyone that he is a famous Hollywood Director. Deprived from contact with the outside world, Sullivan is forced to look deep inside himself and those around him. By doing so, he gradually finds clues that could help him find the key to the inner-peace he longs to find.",

Gifted with the ability to thoroughly mix comedy and methodical lessons about life, his canon of work has become a classic in of itself. To me, Sullivan's Travels has to rival The Lady Eve as his best work. In Eve, he had two of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen together in a script full of farce and scintillating dialogue. Here, there is a sublime story of Hollywood director who goes on a journey as a hobo to experience the hardships of American life in order to make a movie about it. He's tired of making comedies, complaining that they don't mean anything to anybody. Along the way, he meets the short, yet stunning Veronica Lake and experiences a chain of events like no other.\n\nThis is a serious comedy, yet there is so much to laugh at and be moved by. Surely Sturges wanted the audience to laugh at certain scenes, and also be touched by others, such as the scene in church where they are watching a vintage Disney cartoon. The end is beautiful when Sullivan realizes that comedy is meaningful and sustains hope for those that he tried to discover: the poor and helpless.

The concept of this film is great and sets up the best aspect of the film, which is the subtext about the naivety of the rich and the struggle of the poor.  It's a classic character arch, but it's pulled off with such deft style that we the message is delivered with a smile of your face.  The last act seemed a little over the top, in the bad way.

                "text": "\nSullivan's Travels has a lot to offer. Its comedy is often great, and its drama is even greater. It is also one of the most well written films I have ever seen, especially from the studio system. \n\nThis is its basic premise: a Hollywood director, Sullivan, sees the suffering of the common people around him, or at least he thinks he has, and decides he must do something about it: he will make a movie about the horrors of everyday life in the slums of America. His producers object: what does he know about their lives? He's a rich college graduate, privileged all his life. He makes several thousand dollars a week. They've got him here, but he has a solution: he'll don a hobo's garb, leave his home with only a dime, and walk the streets looking for trouble. This he genuinely attempts, but his producers refuse to leave him alone, sending a high-tech fleet after him, equipped with doctors, cooks, writers, and PR people. Also, no matter how hard he tries, Sullivan ends up back in Hollywood every time. The second time he is re-routed, he meets up with a girl, played by Veronica Lake. She suggests that she could help him, for she has been on the road for a while. And that she does, although they still cannot escape the fleet of protectors. Finally, after travelling from L.A. to Kansas City as hobos (at least most of the way), Sullivan decides that he has done enough and has learned what he needs to learn.\n\nMy reaction was: \"WHAT?!?!?!\" After the movie had tried to establish that these pretentious people know not a thing about the meek, it is giving up this early? By this point, its view of homelessness was the same as it was nearly everywhere else: hobos are just happy people who don't need a home.\n\nLuckily, and fantastically, the film takes an unexpected corner at this point. Instead of contradicting itself, it boldly points out that it was thus far contradicting itself. In an arrogant haze (and mostly through the fault of the PR crew), Sullivan goes out on the street with $1000 worth of fives, planning to distribute them to the homeless whom he finds. One of the homeless men, after receiving his $5 bill (and consequently gazing upon Sullivan's stack of them), follows him and knocks him out, stealing the rest of the wad. The hobo stuffs Sullivan into a train car, and then he is hit by a train while trying to collect the money he has dropped. His friends, after an exhaustive search, determine that the dead hobo is actually Sullivan. Sullivan meanwhile awakes in a haze in the deep south, where a railroad worker is hassling him to get off of the train. In a daze, Sullivan assaults the man. Because of this, he is arrested and thrown into prison.\n\nThere is a half-hour left at this point, and it solidifies this film's stake as a masterpiece. Finally, Sullivan has gotten what he wished for: the vagrant's treatment. As a convict, he and his fellow convicts are tormented. No one believes his story (heck, they won't even listen!). The film's climactic scene is brilliant: the convicts are allowed to visit an all black church (and, although these black folk are a bit stereotyped, as you can only expect in a film from 1942, they are shown in a surprisingly human light; they may actually be the kindest and most sincere characters in the entire film; although it is not expressed explicitly, these people were surely just as oppressed as the convicts) where they are showing a film. It is a Micky Mouse cartoon, and both the black folk and the convicts break into uproarious laughter. Sullivan at first resists. He is a serious film director. He takes the medium seriously as an art. But then, he quickly comes to realize that this laughter is helping them much, much more than a film about their lives ever could. Afterwards, through a great twist, Sullivan alerts his friends of his whereabouts, which brings about his release. And the serious movie about the downtrodden he so very much wanted to make before his whole adventure he decides to scrap. A comedy would help much more.\n\nSo, effectively, Sullivan's Travels simultaneously entertains and argues a very good point. Still, I think there must be a reason for dramas about the downtrodden. Who could ever deny the emotions awoken by a film like The Bicycle Thieves. I think these sorts of dramas are not meant to help the downtrodden directly, but rather they are meant to make those not downtrodden aware of the plight of those less fortunate, and therefore cause them to care and possibly even to do something. I hope this is how it works. I wonder how this film was accepted by the critics and the audiences when it was first released. \n\nP.S. Is Veronica Lake not the most beautiful Hollywood starlette you've ever seen? This is the first film I've seen with her in it (not counting L.A. Confidential!). Maybe my only complaint is that she was not in it nearly enough!",

While attempting to make a comedy with some sense of purpose or message is a noble and bolder undertaking then most comedies (especially screwball comedies of the 30s/40s) were willing to attempt. That doesn't mean it automatically gets an 'A', on effort alone. The fact is that this \"comedy\" doesn't even attempt to be a comedy for the last half of the movie and instead veers sharply into melodramatic commentary on the inequities of depression age America, and the misguided way in which the upper-class views the lower. Oh and it also points out how ultimately Hollywood is a friend to the every man and provides a great social service, kind of like Clooney's Oscar speech. Anyway the point is that all of the comedy in this movie is confined to the first half and the second is an overwrought drama, which beats its message home. If this was truly a great comedy it would have integrated the two halves instead of lumping them one on after the other. Making a highly comedic satire that seamlessly blends comedy and drama while maintaining an interesting plot and effectively conveying the message can be done. 'Dr. Strangelove', or perhaps more to the point 'Network' and 'The Player' accomplish this task much more successfully then 'Sullivan's Travels' does.\n\nIn any event I fail to see how AFI could rank this has the 39th funniest movie of all time. Was it the part where Veronica Lake pushes McCrea into the pool, and then she falls in, and the butler walks up and...well you know the rest. That bit has been done before\u0085 but only like a million times before, and sometimes it's a lake or pond instead of a swimming pool, and I've seen it done with a puddle of mud and a bath tub too, but I digress. Or okay, how about the part where McCrea gets in the car with the kid and it goes tearing down the street out of control with the van chasing after them. Hmmm, well OK how about the \"witty dialogue\", which for the period didn't come nearly as fast or furious as it does in other pictures. Now granted you may find the dialogue funny, and I can't say that you don't; maybe you honestly do. Maybe you were put in a maniacal uncontrollable fit of laughter, like some of those prisoners were watching Pluto chase his tale around; who knows? But what you can't tell me is that there are any jokes in the last 30 minutes of the film. And it is impossible for me to understand how a movie that half consists of routine slapstick in its first act, and doesn't even attempt comedy in its final act is the 39th funniest movie of all time. Oh wait, I know, it's a freaking \"classic\" first off, and not only that but one that champions the film industry itself. Give me a break. Oh by the way, the little joke I made in the first two lines of this review, is funnier then anything in 'Sullivan's Travels'. So at least if seeing the movie has lead you to read these reviews; you got to see at least one good joke. If you're looking for a classic screwball comedy (And after watching this I wouldn't even classify it as such, but that's what I heard going in.) go rent Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing up Baby or something that isn't Sullivan's Travels.",

There is greatness all around this movie, but it never feels focused enough to say what it wants. Still it has to be admired for daring to go someplace no one else could have even imagined back in 1941. And remember, though there were movies about Hollywood afterwards no one went anywhere near this until Fellini. But watching it for the first time today in many years, I was surprised how difficult it was to get involved. It seemed to stop and restart so many times that I got impatient. Still the scene where the prisoners watch the cartoon is undeniably one of the most moving moments in American screen history. And it is also easy to see how many future directors took their lead from what Sturges was trying to do here. Ambition alone can sometimes be quite rewarding.",

                "text": "The plot: John Sullivan, a Hollywood director of comedies and musicals, has become tired of that kind of stuff and wants now to work in serious, Capra--like, social stories, so he decides to take the road as a hobo, with only 10 \u00a2 in his pocket, to get directly acquainted with that lifestyle. Now, for starters, what I don't get there is: what makes it impossible for him to work in both, social drama & commentary and comedy at the same time? Has he never heard of Chaplin, of the films in which he achieved a smooth mixture of both? Has he never seen a Three Stooges short, where not only the sad condition of the downtrodden is exposed naked but also the very rich in all his pomposity and cold-heartedness? But that's only one of Sullivan's problems.\n\nNow, to mention the Three Stooges would seem out of place here, but it isn't. See, all three, Chaplin, the Stooges and Sullivan form a rainbow spanning the entire social spectrum, from bottom to top. We know that Chaplin's life as a kid was mired in poverty, that he was taken more than once, along with his brother Sydney, to orphanages because his widowed mother couldn't provide for them--she even got to be institutionalized herself for mental illness because of malnourishment. Such sad circumstances would play later a crucial role in the mood of his films, which present a rather sad, even dark, undertone. On the other hand the bros. Horowitz--Shemp, Moe & Curly--were the sons of a textile cutter who seems to have provided his family with a more or less comfortable life, for the times, something that also shows in their flicks. See how poverty, misery, is usually treated by them in a grotesquely funny way, which makes evident their psychological distance to it. The Stooges knew of misery and hunger of course, but not because they lived in it but because they witnessed it every day. There is where their inspiration for their usually wretched characters comes. When we come to Sullivan we see instead that he has been all his life isolated from from hunger and misery, which means he got no inkling of it. So his butler hit the right note in his speech, a high point of the movie, when he tells him that he has no idea what poverty is; that he has been incapacitated by his life experience of even getting near its substance, so his endeavor is condemned to fail. All that becomes obvious at the end and it also makes for a disappointing movie ending--one reviewer here refers to Sullivan as shallow, selfish and hypocritical, which may be true, as he adapts so smoothly to the sad realization that he will never be able to do meaningful work, like social drama for ex.(and what about that \"they don't put movie directors in places like this?). Truth is, he remains the same socially clueless, upper crust guy from beginning to end. That is why this is not a happy ending, but one that we have to watch with mixed feelings. If Sullivan is really the artist he thinks he is, he has to feel sad because he has to realize how limited he is as such.\n\nNow, concerning the movie itself I'll say that a) the cinematography is great and b) the plot is very uneven. This script should have made for a perfectly smooth plot development from beginning to end but there are two almost symmetrical bumps that affect it in different ways, pushing it in opposite directions. First we got the madcap road race, which doesn't belong here but in a Stooges' short, down to the black cook getting creamed all over his face. This is a comedy that flirts with drama, as I see it, and that kind of antics throws you off, even more so when the bit isn't even funny. Later on we got the \"Devil's Island\" episode, where the flick turns straightly into heavy drama. That's an even bigger bump, which completely changes the mood and breaks up the plot in two, or even three. Filmmakers should be aware, before start doing such abrupt changes in genre of the effects they'll have on the established mood of the viewers as it may happen that they won't accept them kindly. Suggestions have been made that what Sturges wanted was to get some serious stuff past the studio, some social commentary, but that's not a good way to do such a thing. After the 60 min. mark a flick has a well established identity, mood, direction, momentum, and suddenly going from comedy to drama--putting the protagonist of the ongoing comedy in chains and greatly darkening his life outlook--won't do much good for the end product. That's the case here, even more so when the point to be made was simply that the poor have so little going on in their lives that laughter means a lot to them. If Sullivan had just been amnesic all that time, while staying with the black priest, his congregation, until the Mickey Mouse picture, the point could have been made just as well. That's why this entire Devil's Island episode looks alien, unjustified, even intrusive. No wonder the flick finally returns to comedy, where it belongs.\n\nAs already said, technically great. Superb camera work, specially when comes to trains and railroads. Also in scenes in shelters for the homeless, soup kitchens. Sharp, witty dialogs all over. Score appropriate, without being great. Oh and Veronica Lake must be one of the coolest, foxiest gals to ever hit the big time in Hollywood; one point for her, which balances the one I'm taking because of the mentioned flaws. In all 7/10.\n\nBTW, check the portrait of the husband of the widow who locks Sullivan in the bedroom. He changes expressions according to the ongoing action. That's a nice touch.",

He finds a beautiful but cynical women on the road and they travel together for many interesting adventures.

                "text": "No writer director in the forties had a better resume than Preston Sturges. His satiric scripts and slapstick physical comedy linked together brilliantly in providing equal amounts of high and low humor from beginning to end in films such as The Lady Eve, Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Hail the Conquering Hero. He was a master of keeping things light while making trenchant observations about American society's foibles and hypocrisy. He had you laughing and thinking at the same time. Sullivan's Travels is a prime example of Sturges's unique and enormous talent in his prime.\n\nJohn Sullivan is a very successful director of comedy films. He is disillusioned however by the reality that the Depression lingers and a large portion of American population remains in dire straights. Idealistically he decides to climb down from his ivory tower and hit the road as a hobo to get a real feel for America and perhaps make the Great American film. His producers become alarmed at his naivet\u00e9 and decide to monitor his journey but he evades them and soon finds himself convicted of a capital crime and on a chain gang.\n\nTravel's moves at a laugh filled lightening pace before the reality of being down and out on the road creeps in with some brutal desperate situations. Joel McCrae as the obstinately idealistic Sullivan goes from an energized self righteousness to anonymous victim of the times with an impressive transitional believability. Veronica Lake as his sidekick displays a tough and sexy exterior and is a perfect counterbalance to Sullivan's innocence abroad. Sturges stock supporting cast of William DeMaresat, Eric Blore, Porter Hall, Franklin Pangborn and Arthur Grieg as his butler lend solid backing but it is Arthur Hoyt as the minister of an impoverished black community that provides the film its most moving moment with a low key but highly emotional sermon to his flock about acceptance.\n\nBy film's end Sullivan has come full circle through a series of misadventures to learn what he instinctively knew all along but needed the experiences to become conscious of. It is achieved through Sturges superb balance of comedy with serious undertones without cynicism and preachiness. It effortlessly moves from light to dark and back into the light shining it on the country's woes in a humorously eloquent manner that informs along the way about the infinite importance of laughter. Sullivan's Travels is one powerful screwball comedy well worth the trip.",

                "text": "\nI came upon \"Sullivan's Travels\" quite by accident, in the list of DVDs at my public library system. At first I thought it was a documentary. I had never heard of writer/director Preston Sturges, but now I want to seek out more of his work. The DVD (2001) is especially nice because of the very clear picture, but also the several \"extras\" which includes a 76-minute feature on Sturges himself, and how he changed movies forever. He is credited with introducing \"irony\" into film, and the snappy, humorous dialog that was his trademark.  He was also the first \"writer\" that was allowed to \"direct\" his own film. His window of success was very narrow, spanning only a few years, but it was significant.\n\nfollowing comments contain SPOILERS - do not read before seeing the film.\n\n\"Sullivan's Travels\" can be seen as a fictional account of Sturges' own experiences. Wanting to make a drama based on the poor and oppressed (OH Brother, Where Art Thou?), Sullivan's handlers convinced him he did not have the life experiences for that. So he (Joel McCrea)set out to get them, dressed up as a bum, accompanied by pretty and down on her luck actress (petite and pretty Veronica Lake). Through an unexpected turn, he ends up in jail, sentenced to 6 years of labor, while all his associates thought he was dead, killed by a train. But it was a bum they found, maimed by a train, who had stolen Sullivan's shoes.\n\nSullivan's transformation came while attending a \"movie\", chained to other prisoners, at a local black church. It was a Mickey Mouse cartoon and, as he observed all the prisoners laughing, realized that comedy was needed, not another drama about the oppressed. Real life Sturges realized the same thing, and his efforts changed movie making.\n\nSo, how to get out of prison and back to movie making?  He pleaded guilty to having murdered Sullivan (himself), apparently solving the mystery. He knew that would get his picture in the paper and, sure enough, his pretty girl recognized him, he was freed, and returned to movie making with comedies. He had been married, only for tax purposes, in a scheme by his former manager. His \"wife\" had already remarried and the potential scandal freed him to be with his pretty friend, forever!\n\nIn many respects this film was as important to film making in general as \"Citizen Kane\" was.  It is black and white, the shooting and editing are crisp, the dialog is smart. Morality was different back then, as the main characters did not even consider an intimate relationship, even though Sullivan's marriage was a sham. An example of the smart dialog, a play was being discussed and mentioned that it didn't run very long in Pittsburgh. One actor mentioned \"Don't you think people in Pittsburgh know what they like?\" Sullivan replied, \"If they did, they wouldn't stay in Pittsburgh.\"  We may take that kind of humor for granted today, but in 1941 it was revolutionary. \n\nThis has to be considered a \"must see\" for anyone interested in the history of film and its evolution.

            "Sullivan is a successful, spoiled, and naive director of fluff films, with a heart-o-gold, who decides he wants to make a film about the troubles of the downtrodden poor. Much to the chagrin of his producers, he sets off in tramp's clothing with a single dime in his pocket to experience poverty first-hand, and gets some reality shock.",
            "After years of kowtowing to studio executives by making light, fluffy fare, successful and talented movie director John L. Sullivan wants to make a \"message\" movie, specifically about the plight of the downtrodden in society. Beyond wanting him to continue making money-making escapist movies, the studio executives counter that his privileged background does not make him qualified to make a movie about the downtrodden. So Sullivan decides to hit the road with only 10\u00a2 in his pocket to experience truly what it's like to be poor. The studio executives will only allow him to do so if they can follow him and document his experience. Not wanting it to be a publicity stunt, Sullivan makes a deal with his tailing party: leave him alone for a few weeks, with them all to meet up at a determined location after that time. After a few mis-starts where he can't seem to shed his privileged past, Sullivan does manage to hit the road, this time with an aspiring but struggling actress who believes she can better help him navigate road life. He met her when she did a Good Samaritan deed for him. But when Sullivan tries to do his own Good Samaritan deed in return, he finds that shedding his downtrodden life may be even harder than it was to shed his privileged life if he is able to do it at all.",
            "In Hollywood, the spoiled director of humdrum movies, John Lloyd Sullivan, was born in silver spoon but is very successful with his superficial comedies. Out of the blue, he tells to his producer Mr. LeBrand that he wants to make serious dramas, like \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" and he will live like a tramp on the streets to learn the sorrows of great part of the population. He wears cheap clothes and tries to blend with poor people but he always returns to Hollywood protected by the safety team hired by the studio. One day, he goes to a dinner with a coin and a blonde girl offers bacon and eggs to him. Soon he learns that the girl is a failed actress that had never a chance in Hollywood and is returning home hitchhiking without any money. Sullivan decides to retribute her kindness giving a ride to her in his car but they are arrested by the police. When they are released, the girl decides to join Sullivan in his quest to learn about poverty. When Sullivan is satisfied, he is robbed and dumped unconscious in a train. He awakes in the countryside where there is an incident and he is arrested and sentenced to a labor camp, where he leans the importance of comedy in the miserable lives of destitute people.",
            "Hollywood movie director John Sullivan is tired of making lightweight comedies and musicals and decides to go on the road, posing as a hobo in order to learn how the poor live. Those around him think he's mad but he sets off with only 10 cents in his pocket. He has several false starts - always ending up in back in Hollywood. After he meets an out of work actress they managed to live a few days with tramps and hobos. It's only the beginning of Sullivan's adventures - including a stint in prison - and in that time learns the importance of those lightweight comedies he had so come to hate.",
            "Director John L. Sullivan wants to make a social-problems film called 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' When his producers point out that he knows nothing about trouble or poverty, he goes on the road as a hobo. Joined by a down-on-her-luck aspiring actress, the results are hardly the kind of trouble he had in mind. But when the 'experiment' seems to be over, Sullivan falls into more trouble than he ever dreamed of..."

            "One of the rarest, which is okay as it seldom even appears on the want lists of dedicated P.R.C. collectors (especially those who have seen it), and one of the oddest of the \"who-let-this-out\" films. Filmed on location in the Kansas City area, with only B-western star Fred Scott and actress Loie Bridge the only two in the cast who had ever been in a film (and Scott had none after this), and the only other Hollywood connections were director Fred C. Newmeyer, who hadn't had a directing job since 1937 and who chose to be billed as Fred Neymeyer here; cameraman Edward A. Kull, billed as Eddie Kull and editor George Halligan, who may have assumed it wouldn't be seen by anybody and kept his own name on the credits. At this period in time, actress Loie Bridge was a Kansas City residence herself. Sister of actor Alan Bridge, the pair had their start in Kansas City co-managing a stock company at the Empress Theatre, before brother Al headed for Minneapolis and, later, the bright lights of Tinseltown. Loie stayed at home in Kansas City running stock companies, with an occasional role in California in early 1930's B-westerns that usually had brother Al in the cast. Loie left Kansas City for good it appears circa 1942-43 and had a fair career as a character actress. Roy Knapp, a Kansas City dry cleaner, opened a kid's riding academy in that city circa 1926 and,in a few years, his troupe of riding young daredevils (ages from 4 years old to late teens) were performing in rodeos and livestock shows all over the American Midwest. One of the riding stars of the troupe was a 5-year-old girl named (correct spelling) Roylene \"Small Fry\" Smith, who evidently became Donna Jean Meinke somewhere along the way, according to the cast listing on the IMDb. While the film is a showcase for Roy Knapp's \"Rough Riders,\" it is not a story of the group, although \"Knapp\" is the character role names for Scott and Bridge, who play brother and sister. She plays Tillie Knapp, struggling to keep the Knapp Orphanage open. The highlight event at the Orphanage each year is the annual summer vacation visit the kids make to the ranch of her brother Buck, who sends her money to pay for the trip. Alas, this year, Alex Twitchell, local money-bag version of Snively Whiplash, has purchased the mortgage due on the orphanage and the Knapp Ranch, and demands immediate payment. Tillie gives him all the money that had been saved for the trip. To keep the kids, orphans all, from being disappointed, her old vaudeville partner, Joe Stegge, takes her and the kids to the ranch in his truck. The kids learn that Uncle Buck and Aunt Tillie are in dire straits and enlist the aid of Jim Corey, a former member of the orphanage, and Ellie Knapp, Buck's daughter, to help them put on a rodeo and use the money to help Aunt Tillie. Whiplash, uh, Twitchell arrives and legally ties up all of Buck's property, which includes the ponies the kids were going to ride in the rodeo and pay off the old homestead. But Twitchell is in a car wreck, and the kids save his life by taking him from under the car and rushing him to the hospital. Twitchell releases the ponies and the rodeo is held and enough money raised to pay off the mortgage. But Twitchell says the money is for them and he not only is going to retire the mortgage himself, he is going to build them a bigger and better Orphanage. While producer Leo J. McCarthy wrote the story, he and the two other writers chose to be uncredited also or, at least, PRC chose not to credit them. Aside from the riding ability of the kids---and they were good---this film is a good measurement of the talent level of Kansas City stock company players at the time, which also indicates that Kansas City was among the last to know that Vaudeville had died. But Victor Adamson and Robert J. Horner made worse films without leaving California. Not by much, though."

And the idea of a small-town homebody having two sophisticated New Yorkers fall for her is inherently funny, but most of the time I found myself not laughing. So the film is a valiant try but no cigars are forthcoming. This was the last film Janet Gaynor made for about 19 years. (The film \"The Young in Heart (1938)\" was made earlier in 1938 but came out later that year.) Gaynor is perfect as the girl, with Montgomery and Franchot Tone giving good performances.\n\nI was startled at a major goof near the end, when Gaynor's family and Tone's family meet in Tone's apartment. His father is played by Douglas Wood, who has the speaking part. But in some shots we clearly see another man (Charles Richman) in the background standing in for Tone's father. There was no effort to hide him either, and even if you don't know either actor, you just have to know that Wood has a mustache and Richman doesn't.  And the all the actors' placement with each of the fathers are totally mismatched.  To me, this ranks as the greatest lack of continuity by a major studio ever, and I'd be curious to know why it happened. \n",

                "text": "THREE LOVES HAS NANCY is a delicious overlooked romantic comedy from 1938, closer to slapstick than screwball. Janet Gaynor was one of the absolute top female movie stars for almost a dozen years when this was made but little did the public know she was making her swansong as a star, soon to retire to marry and start a family. Well known for her heart-touching dramatic performances, this movie proves she was also an excellent comedienne and perhaps should have done more work in the genre.\n\nRobert Montgomery is a popular novelist living in Manhattan, a spoiled, confirmed bachelor (the old style, the kind that likes women but not marriage) who finds his current girlfriend actress Claire Dodd and her ambitious Cora Witherspoon a little tougher to wrangle away from in his attempts to keep his unmarried state than he's used to. His longtime best friend (and now editor) Franchot Tone tells him to accept a publicity tour for his books to get away from the gals attempts to brand him. While out in the sticks he meets sweet little chatterbox hillbilly Nancy (Janet Gaynor) who attends his department store lecture and buys his book due to her mother's prompting (she's quite appalled to learn book will cost her a whopping two dollars and regrets having him sign it before learning this, now that it's \"ruined\" she is stuck with buying it.) It's the eve of her wedding to local boy George who is away in New York making good but is due in any minute for the wedding. Montgomery gets a telegram learning Claire is away on tour and Gaynor gets one that George is calling off the marriage for mysterious reasons so they both get on the train to New York at the same time, Janet to find out what is up with George.\n\nJanet doesn't find George but she does track down Robert and through a series of complications ends up working as the cook for his best friend Franchot. Franchot quickly falls in love with her (who knew the way to a New York playboy's heart was homemade butter and pancakes?) but it's clear Janet, while trying to track down George, is becoming drawn to the shallow storyteller Robert.\n\nThis movie seems blatantly inspired by Noel Coward's DESIGN FOR LIVING with two best friends in Manhattan becoming rivals for the affections of a sassy little minx though cleverly camouflaged by Janet's rural South background and the slapstick comedy. Of the three stars I feel Janet comes out best although Robert Montgomery is in his element in his stock semi-cad heartthrob. Franchot Tone is fine but as has been mentioned is almost an unnecessary third wheel given the unusual brevity of the film for an \"A\" movie from MGM (scarcely 70 minutes)and the fast-paced story. Of the supporting cast, Cora Witherspoon stands out, for once remarkably chic and dolled up in mink through still the brash dame she always is. Guy Kibbee's role as Janet's father is surprisingly small, scarcely more than a line or two despite his playing the lead in scores of B's and major featured parts in films during this period. Watch for early talkie star Grant Withers in a bit as the restaurant patron Janet is unknowingly flirting with as well as handsome Kane Richmond, a C movie favorite, as his buddy and dining companion.\n\nThe movie boasts elegant art deco sets for the neighboring penthouse apartments of Montgomery and Tone (they share a terrace that allows them to walk in and out of each other's apartments and in one of the more blatant lifts from DESIGN FOR LIVING have an almost suspiciously close relationship but one as in the Coward play watered down by their rivalry.) This movie moves so fast and at just 70 minutes it's over almost before you know it, ending with a good running gag which tops even the surprise last reel appearance of George but fans of 1930's romantic comedies will eat this up like Nancy's tasty vittles.",

The result is mere amusement.\n\nI don't think another actress could have saved this film, but Gracie Allen, Irene Dunne or Jean Arthur might have given it a stronger comedic base. The writers of this film were pitching screwball, but they missed the plate entirely.",

                "text": "\"Three Loves Has Nancy\" is a frustrating film to watch. This is because it has many wonderful moments...but also some bad ones where the characters struggle very hard to make it work...and it doesn't. It's because the film sometimes tries just too hard to be goofy. I really think the film would have been better had they just allowed the film to have some quiet moments and trust the film to work. But, it's all loud and forced.\n\nThe film finds Robert Montgomery playing a novelist. In a funny scene, he meets the rather oblivious lady played by Janet Gaynor. And, from her on, Montgomery and Gaynor's paths keep crossing--and in each case, Montgomery comes off on the losing end! It's quite cute--and reminiscent of another 1938 comedy, \"Bringing Up Baby\". However, once Montgomery brings Gaynor home, the film really loses direction. Having the love triangle of Montgomery, Franchot Tone and the unseen George just doesn't work--I would have just concentrated on Montgomery and Gaynor. In fact, Tone really wasn't necessary at all--and from here on the film is a bit of a disappointment. Worth seeing? Probably....but understand the film is highly uneven.",

            "The seduction plans of novelist Malcolm Niles go awry when actress Vivian Herford brings along her mother to a candlelight dinner in his New York apartment. When they talk of marriage, Malcolm decides to make a tour promoting his new book, and in a small southern town meets Nancy Briggs at an autographing session at the local bookstore. Nancy is getting married that night, but her fianc\u00e9, working in New York, doesn't come back for the wedding, so her family gives her the fare to go to New York to find him. At the same time, Malcolm gets a wire from his publisher and friend, Robert Hanson, telling him to come home because Vivian has left town. Traveling to New York on the same train, Nancy proves to be a pest who Malcolm hopes to avoid once they arrive, but when Nancy can't find her fianc\u00e9, she goes to Malcolm, since he's the only one she knows in the city. He is about to kick her out when Vivian returns, so he uses Nancy as an excuse to get rid of Vivian. In the ensuing days, Nancy cooks and cleans for both Malcolm and Robert, who lives next door. Trouble begins when Robert falls in love with Nancy and Malcolm finds that he is jealous."

The scene itself is pretty lame by today standards, but I could imagine how it was received back in the 1940s. The story involves maid Anna S\u00f6derberg (Hagman), who takes on her responsibility to transform lazy archipelago brothers Kalle (Jahr), Lasse (Rol\u00e9n), Nisse (Elfstr\u00f6m) in to civilized men, with table manors, and all a woman possibly could wish for. This film could have been a boring farce like so many other Swedish comedies produced at the time, but instead director Ivar Johansson together with Erik Lundeg\u00e5rd created 104 minutes of Swedish joy. Personally I would say this was a pleasant surprise, to bad the end is disappointing.\n\nFilmed earlier in 1925, 1932 (Sweden), 1943 (Denmark) and later in 1967 (Denmark).

K. Jerome (whose biggest fame would come from \"Casablanca\" two years later).\n\nThe great Irish tenor of Dennis Morgan shines. All else is a pleasurable hour of concise entertainment.

And when he said no they devolved on to lesser players in the pecking order.\n\nCase in point is this film Tear Gas Squad in which there is no such specialized squad in any police department I know. And we only see tear gas being used in the final showdown with the bad guys here. What this is all about is yet another buddy film that was probably meant for the team of Cagney and Pat O'Brien.\n\nDennis Morgan plays a nightclub singer with not too good an opinion of cops, but joins the force any way to impress Gloria Dickson who comes from a family of them. And she's got Sergeant John Payne who is also courting her who gives Morgan a ticket and gets a lot of lip from Morgan. So when he winds up Morgan's training officer you can only imagine what follows.\n\nWhich you've seen in any number of Cagney/O'Brien films all of them better than this. At least Morgan got to sing a bit. John Payne who has a few good notes in his system as well sang not a bit.\n\nFortunately for both Morgan and Payne better films were coming along although Payne would have to move to 20th Century Fox for them.",

Poor John Payne has to play O'Brien to Morgan's Cagney. Nice supporting cast includes many future TV stars: Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction), William Hopper (Perry Mason), Herbert Anderson (Dennis the Menace), George Reeves and John Hamilton (Adventures of Superman).

Soon she invites the singer to her house where he learns that there are all cops in her family and there's another man, also a cop (John Payne), who also has a thing for her. The singer decides to become a cop himself and this here is where the trouble starts. TEAR GAS SQUAD is pretty straight from start to finish and it follows just about every clich\u00e9 that you'd expect it to but I still thought the film managed to be quite entertaining through its 55-minute running time. The best thing about the picture is that director Terry O. Morse manages to keep it running at an extremely fast pace and he never lets any of the action slow down. There are all sorts of strange things going on here including the non-stop singing from Morgan who is constantly throwing out a song. Even stranger is the entire love triangle as the woman pretty much disappears from the picture and we're just left with two guys who can't stand one another. Of course there has to be \"drama\" from the poor attitude of the singer, his fall from grace and then the redemption. I thought Morgan and Payne were both very entertaining in their roles. I'd stop short of saying they gave great performances since the material is pretty light but there's still no doubt that they help keep the film entertaining. Dickson was good as the love interest but she really didn't have too much to do. George Reeves has a couple quick but memorable scenes. If you're looking for top-notch entertainment or an Oscar-winner then you're not going to find it here but those who like \"B\" movies should find plenty of entertainment here.",

Wannabe cop brother Dennis Morgan sings in a nightclub, gaining a slap from tough Irish gal Gloria Dickson who slowly falls for his own brand of blarney when he wins over her family with a series of Irish lullaby's, with the exception of her tough cop suitor (John Payne) who makes his training a living hell. Between the two rivals, there's little room for gangsters to make a racket, although elements of a full plot are few and far between. The big story involves Morgan's determination to get away from the squad glee club and do something to impress Dickson and show Payne up.\n\nHarry Shannon and Mary Gordon add heart to the role of Dickson's Irish immigrant parents, emotional over the singing of \"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\", a corny moment for sure, but you may find your eyes smiling along. A good bulk of this finds Morgan singing which without, this would clock in at a little more than half an hour. It takes more than 3/4 of the film to return to the plot set-up concerning Reeves, making me wonder how this managed to get past the approval of the Warner executives. So as entertaining as it seems to be, it's untimely pretty sloppy and a weak entry even on the B level. Even so, the film moves at a brisk pace, never slowing down for a second.

To check to see if he is the villain, the boys stop, lift the hat and we find Curly, thin faced, full head of hair, NO BEARD, and a clothes pin on his nose!

Well, if you've read the comments here or are familiar with Stooges history, this is the only time all three Howard brothers-Moe, Shemp, and Curly-appeared in the same scene together. I also believe the same film together. Anyway, Curly has a funny cameo as a passenger in a train with a derby on his head and a clothespin on his nose. When the boys lift the pin, Curly goes into his patented snore and \"woo woos\"! The rest was hilarious as well especially with the title animal causing havoc with the boys and scaring an African-American porter played by Dudley Dickerson though one may pause a little bit before laughing since that was a stereotype of that race at the time. Throw in Emil Sitka as the Stooges attorney and Kenneth MacDonald as the one who attempts to steal their inheritance and you've got one classic Stooge short! So yes, I highly recommend Hold That Lion!",

It accomplishes the difficult task of bridging the War years-type shorts with the Post War. It displays Shemp in the best light that we know; giving him a chance to shine.*\n\nJUST COINCIDENTALLY THE short features an un-billed cameo by the now physically ailing Curly. His bit as a slumbering train passenger was meant to be the kick-off for some regular guest shots with Larry Fine and his brothers, Shemp and Moe Howard.\n\nTHIS ONGOING LIMITED partnership never materialized, leaving this as a unique solo example of what could have been.\n\nAS FOR THE story itself, it is a sort of Detective Story spoof; featuring stolen money, a crooked shyster lawyer and our heroes in hot pursuit. The chase even extends to a railroad trip and a confrontation with a real caged Lion in the baggage car. That would seem to be the origin of the title (Duh!); but it is also a play on the then popular song, \"The Tiger Rag\" ( you know, \"Hold That Tiger\").\n\nWE HAVE ALWAYS felt that perhaps the greatest asset this movie has is the character of crooked lawyer, Ichabod Slip. With a characterization that revealed an unexpected talent for farce, actor Kenneth MacDonald managed to steal much of the short's best gags and scenes; in spite of the presence of our Stooges.\n\nTHIS IS THE same guy who made so many appearances on the PERRY MASON TV Series as the Judge.

This film also marks the second appearance of the sinisterly handsome Kenneth MacDonald in a supporting role with the Stooges. MacDonald plays Icabod Slipp, a crooked investment broker who has stolen the boys' inheritance from their deceased uncle. Never being gentlemen that easily throw in the towel, Moe, Larry, and Shemp trail Slipp onto a moving train, where they risk their lives in encountering a lion on the loose! The boys eventually overcome Slipp and recover the satchel of money. (This Three Stooges short actually features FOUR Stooges; Curly Howard, who was too ill to continue working as a Stooge, makes a cameo appearance as a snoring, barking passenger on the train.) \n\nMy favorite highlights from \"Hold That Lion!\" include the following. While in Slipp's office, Shemp does his very famous \"fighter's dance,\" only to receive the first punch from Slipp and get knocked out cold! While in their attorney's office, the Stooges have trouble closing some simple filing cabinet drawers. The African-American train porter (Dudley Dickerson) is hilarious as he sticks his head out the window upon encountering the lion (\"Help! Help! I'm losin' my mind!\"). When the Stooges realize that they are not alone in hiding from the big-eyed train conductor (Heinie Conklin), they scream as they run away from the lion. Later, while the boys are trying to sleep in their berth, Moe sticks his bare foot out the curtain, and the lion comes along and licks his foot.\n\n\"Hold That Lion!\" is simply a great Three Stooges short. Footage from this film was later used in three consecutive Stooge shorts from 1953: \"Booty and the Beast,\" \"Loose Loot,\" and \"Tricky Dicks.\" Director Jules White, who was known for forcing too much slapstick in his later Stooge films from the 1950s, thankfully does not go over the edge in this film, although he did come extremely close in the scene at the attorney's office in which Larry asks Moe about his itching palm. Aside from being the second Stooge film to feature Kenneth MacDonald, \"Hold That Lion!\" is also the second Stooge film to feature one of the most beloved character actors ever to work with the boys: Emil Sitka. Playing the Stooges' attorney Mr. Poole, Sitka recalled that Shemp was so afraid of the lion on the set that he refused to share a scene with the animal; the crew ended up having to place a giant glass plate between the lion and the Stooges.",

While hiding out from the police, Douglas meets Young, and sparks fly.  She agrees to hide him in her budoir.  Inquiring why he wants her husband dead, Young is flabbergasted when Douglas simply responds, \"I didn't like how he held his pinky out while drinking a cup of tea\". Meanwhile, Douglas is caught hiding by Young's screeching maid (Una O'Connor), but she agrees to keep mum about his presence.  Then, Pallette shows up, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nThat is the basic premise for this \"Ninotchka\" in reverse; Young and Douglas are a romantic team worth looking at.  I didn't care much for Young in a lot of her films as she was just oh-so-perfect, and oh-so unbelievable, like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.  However, in this film, she allows herself to be a little less than perfect, and as a result, I was able to warm up to her.  Douglas, the leading man for practically every leading lady in Hollywood, has one of his better roles in this one; He is finally given equal treatment to his on-screen partner, rather than to simply be the cause of the heroine's misery.  The two stars react off each other, rather than act; that makes them more worth watching.  Eugene Pallette, one of the most popular character actors of all time, gets a chance to show what he can do as a rather unlikable character; He is so ridiculous in his pomposity that you can't help but want Douglas to shoot him.  And the ending scene where Young has her come-uppance (which I will not spoil) is hysterical! Una O'Connor has nothing to do but scream and rant like a harpy; She is one of those actors you just wish would go away because she is just so annoying. O'Connor did give some wonderful performances (\"Cavalcade\", among others), but mostly she just makes me cringe.  I'd hate to watch one of her films while suffering from a hangover!\n\nOverall, \"He Stayed For Breakfast\" is one of those inocuous little comedys that can be pleasing, but makes one ready for lunch shortly afterwards.  I compare it to showing up at a breakfast for eggs and bacon, and only ending up with toast and coffee-easy to stay awake for, but desperate for a little something else.",

                "text": "Despite being the birthplace of the brilliant pioneer of fantasy films, Segundo De Chom\u00f3n (whose films rivaled Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s in quality and inventive), Spain's filmography within the realm of the horror genre is considerably poor before the 60s, when Jesus (or Jess) Franco inaugurated Spaniard horror. This was the result of the difficult political climate of the country during the regime of dictator Francisco Franco. In fact, while there were a couple of fantasy films done before 1962, the only true horror film was a little known movie titled \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\", directed by Edgar Neville, and based on a popular pulp novel written by Emilio Carrere. However, despite being the only example of Spaniard horror film-making in the 40s, this film is more than a mere curiosity, it is actually a forgotten gem of the genre.\n\nSet in 19th century Madrid, a young man named Basilio (Antonio Casal) decides to play roulette, hoping to make some money to go on a date with the girl he likes. Suddenly, a mysterious character appears (F\u00e9lix De Pom\u00e9s) out of nowhere, and tells Basilio exactly where the ball is going to fall. Winning a small fortune thanks to the stranger, Basilio decides to thank him for the help, only to discover that the mysterious man, named Don Robinson De Mantua, is the ghost of an archaeologist who supposedly committed suicided years ago. In return for the help at the roulette, Don Robinson asks Basilio to protect his daughter In\u00e9s (Isabel De Pom\u00e9s) and help her solve his crime, as Don Robinson was actually murdered. And so Basilio gets involved in a mystery that will take him to discover the entrance to the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks.\n\nAs written above, \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\" is based on Emilio Carrere's novel of the same name (which was partially written by Jes\u00fas De Arag\u00f3n), however, there are many differences between the novel and the film, specially in the tone that scriptwriters Edgar Neville and Jos\u00e9 Santugini give to the story. While the novel has a somber dark humor, Neville's film ops for a lighthearted style, more in tone with American horror and adventure movies (that definitely were a big influence on Neville) than with its literary source. This is not really a bad thing, as the movie keeps the thrilling mix of mystery, humor and suspense of the novel, and I'd go as far as to say that Neville's decision of making a fun movie over a meaningful one actually benefits the film, as while certainly an imitation of Hollywood's typical style, it's anything but conventional.\n\nWhere the movie excels is in its execution, as Neville gives good use to the excellent work of cinematography done by Henri Barreyre and Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez Cubero, giving the film a haunting beauty. The most striking feature of the film is definitely its wonderful set design, with the recreation of the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks having a beautiful expressionist look that feels like taken out from a 1920s German film. The contrast between the surreal expressionism of the Tower with the Gothic atmosphere of Madrid's streets (in scenes shot on location) give the movie an effective nightmarish look, which definitely bring back memories from the American horror films from the 30s (specially the ones by Universal Studios). However, what makes this mix of influences work is Neville's own brand of humor, which gives the film a distinctive personality of its own.\n\nThe cast is for the most part effective, with Antonio Casal leading the cast and making a good job at handling the comedic side of his character (his Braulio is goodhearted, but cowardly and specially naive). As his romantic interest, In\u00e9s, actress Isabel De Pom\u00e9s is good, although nothing really special. Still, this could be blamed to the fact that her character isn't very well developed and it's a stereotypical damsel in distress. On the other hand, Guillermo Mar\u00edn is extraordinary as the mysterious Doctor Sabatino, delivering a powerful performance that definitely ranks among the best in Spain's horror filmography. Mar\u00edn captures perfectly the mix of charming amiability and perverse wickedness that makes Sabatino such an interesting character and he is easily the best in the cast. Finally, F\u00e9lix De Pom\u00e9s is quite funny as Don Robinson's ghost, despite his limited screen time.\n\nNow, while \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\" is certainly an excellent and entertaining film, it sadly is far from being perfect, mainly because in his attempt for imitating the commercially successful American films, director Neville also brings those films' flaws, specifically, their reliance on clich\u00e9s. While the movie has a wonderfully expressionist look and the story is certainly inventive, the plot unfolds in a very conventional way, and while entertaining, it isn't exactly the masterpiece that could had been or that its very artistic look may indicate. This dependence on common clich\u00e9s and some cheap jokes do make a bit simplistic and predictable what otherwise could had been a quite haunting tale of horror. Fortunately, the damage is not really big, and \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\" can still be enjoyed without problem.\n\nOf course, this last criticism is probably just nitpicking, as in the end, \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\" fulfills its purpose without great difficulty: it provides good entertaining as Basilio uncovers the thrilling horrors of the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks. While it would take several years after this film's release for horror to resurrect completely, \"La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados\" did open the doors for the fantastic in Spain's filmography. For this and several other reasons (like its expressionist look, which must be seen to be believed), this little known gem is more than a mere curiosity, it is truly Spain's first horror classic.\n\n8/10",

                "text": "This one is probably the oddest film ever made in Spanish cinema until the take-off of its fantastic and horror genre in the late 1960s. For that reason alone it is remarkable that it was made at all at an era as conservative and narrow-minded as the 1940s was, when Spain was isolated within Europe by the diplomatic and economic boycott of the Allies for having secretly helped the Axis during World War II. In those days of heavy fascist censorship, the films made in Spain where either bourgeois gentle comedies to give audiences a false feeling of optimism and prosperity in a country that was totally ruined, historical epics to remind us how great we once were, or religious dramas to glorify Spain's ultra-Catholicism against the threat of Communism and the Masons. \n\nDuring the early 1930s director Edgar Neville worked in Hollywood, adapting films for the Spanish-speaking market, and there he learnt a great deal about filmmaking. So when he took the reins of \"The Tower\" and wrote the script, he included slices of music-hall, screwball comedy, fairy-tale fantasy and German Expressionism, all combined together while keeping a very Spanish background of traditional Madrid caf\u00e9s at the turn of the century, popular music and songs and people speaking in the local accent, with some location shots in the old quarter of the city that hadn't changed at all since the XIX century. \n\nAs the movie starts we meet Basilio (Antonio Casal) an innocent and bit of a foolish guy. One evening he goes to try his luck at the casino but loses his modest gamble, but then he is approached by the ghost of an elderly gentleman who tells him which number to bet upon. Basilio reluctantly does so, and then wins then some cash which allows him to take his cabaret girlfriend out to supper to impress her but can't avoid being chaperoned by her big mother. Later that night he is visited by the ghost again, who then tells him that he was murdered by a secret society as he was about to discover some sinister plot of theirs, and now his niece is in danger from his murderers. Basilio eventually learns that the gentleman was an archaeologist, and that his associate vanished without a trace when the professor was killed. Basilio immediately falls in love with the niece and starts courting her, and at the same time we start seeing hunchbacks everywhere he goes to, and it becomes quite obvious that they are watching him. A second story within the story then begins to unravel, and it doesn't take us much thinking to deduce that the hunchbacks and the murder of the professor are connected and Basilio is now in the middle of it. One night he follows a hunchback to an old deserted house and ends up discovering a secret passage that leads to an underground city built by the Jews at the time they were being persecuted by the Inquisition, and there he bumps into the professor's long-time missing associate, who is now a bit gaga after being held captive for so long. We soon discover that the gang, led by a mysterious doctor we met a while back, has been engaged for years on digging and smuggling art objects out of the Jewish city and running a counterfeit money press at the same time. The doctor has now kidnapped the professor's niece and is holding her under hypnosis in the city as well, but at the end Basilio rescues her and both flee the city as it collapses after the doctor has exploded a device once he realised the game was over. At the end, with the dastardly villain and his evil organisation destroyed and the mystery of the professor's murder solved, Basilio and the girl will remain together and live happy ever after. \n\nThe unusual and innovative combination of different genres makes it not only an interesting film in terms of content but also very entertaining, suspenseful and funny. It is also a beautiful and loving homage to German Expressionism: Dr Mabuse, Nosferatu, The Golem and The Student of Prague. And also it is blessed with a wonderful cast, led by the naturally gifted for comedy Galician-born actor Antonio Casal, accompanied by two of Neville's regulars: the charming and suave Guillermo Marin as the villain, and the delightful and always bigger- than-life and fantastic scene stealer Julia Lajos as the mother-in-law to fear. \n\n\"The Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks\" has become a cult classic, recently restored and now available in DVD. And it certainly is one of the best films made by one of the most original, creative, innovative and independent directors in Spanish cinema ever: Edgar Neville.",

                "text": "I first heard of this obscure but intriguing little item on the \"Time Out\" Film Guide and obviously leapt at the chance to acquire it recently from a French source \u0096 even if, alas, the print turned out to sport no English subtitles; I usually don't mind it so much \u0096 in the case, for instance, of Jess Franco movies \u0096 but I really felt like I was missing something here! \n\nFrom what I could gather (the Spanish language is partly similar to the Italian in which I'm fluent, but the worn soundtrack present here didn't make it any easier for me!) is fairly rich in twists with a one-eyed ghost (who, Cocteau-like, uses a mirror as a portal from the netherworld) bidding our hero to seek a secret society of hunchbacks involved in the trafficking of archaeological artifacts (but, from reading what few reviews I could find about the film, the latter's also asked to protect the old man's daughter and help her expose his own murderer). While I'm at it, let me just catalogue what other plot/visual elements seem to have escaped me (or else have already receded into my subconscious \u0096 given that I was watching it somewhat half-heartedly): the city of Hunchbacks was apparently built by victimized Jews during the Spanish Inquisition; there's talk of \"thrilling horrors\", \"cobwebbed mummies\" and \"hypnotism\", plus the fact that the villain (who, admittedly, is quite effective) is allowed to get away with it.\n\nEven so, these reviews are equally contradictory: one calls it \"anything but conventional\" whereas another states \"while the movie has a wonderfully expressionist look and the story is certainly inventive, the plot unfolds in a very conventional way, and while entertaining, it isn't exactly the masterpiece that could have been or that its very artistic look may indicate\" \u0096 for what it's worth, I tend to favor this latter view! Incidentally, while it would seem to evoke the feel of the contemporaneous Universal horror films, THE TOWER OF THE SEVEN HUNCHBACKS is really an obvious precursor to the loopier Mexican variety of genre outings which came into full swing during the subsequent decade. Like these other film buffs, however, I regretted the picture's comic relief (apparently, the source novel is more somber) \u0096 at one point, for no apparent reason, even Napoleon's ghost puts in an appearance! \u0096 and even more so the musical sequences.\n\nWhat eventually made the film worthwhile, then, were the atmospheric sets (even if, at this juncture, I wouldn't quite use the epithet \"must be seen to be believed\" to describe them!) and monochrome lighting. Needless to say, I'm grateful for the opportunity to sample this 'lost classic' but I'd love to revisit it in an improved edition \u0096 though, alas, I'm not holding my breath!",

The DVD only has a French Audio soundtrack but there are optional French AND English subtitles which should henceforth make it accessible to anglo-saxon enthousiasts of French cinema. The quality of the film is a slight improvement on the version I saw in 1983 but we are not talking here of a pristine restoration job ! Indeed, the beginning and end credits seem no different from the former version but the body of the film seems to have been \"cleaned up\" although the audio is no great shakes. The two main protagonists, G\u00e9rard Philipe and Micheline Presle, were two of the finest French actors of their day. The film distills a truly weird atmosphere where parts of the soundtrack are played backwards to indicate flashbacks - the music played during the funeral scenes, sung by a sort of wailing choir, must rank amongst the weirdest and most sinister music I've ever heard in a film. The sheer insignificance of Marthe's death in relation to the overall joy at the Armistice being signed is striking. G\u00e9rard Philippe is experiencing internal sadness which is incomprehensible for the rest of the world around him. It appears that the original book by Raymond Radiguet caused quite a scandal at the time.The title theme music by Ren\u00e9 Cloarec is quite haunting and is available on a CD. A remake was made in the late 90's but is not a patch on the original. The film starts with an aeroplane overflying Eastern Paris and several well known buildings such as the Gare de Lyon are instantly recognizeable ! Most of the action, the situation of the school and the boat trip takes place at Nogent-sur-Marne, a few miles east of Paris in the guinguette country.",

I remember begging my father not to start watching the film as it was already 10.15 p.m. and we had to get up the next day for school and work respectively. In the end we were totally captivated by the harrowing story of a young man (G\u00e9rard Philipe) who causes the death, through adultery, of the wife of a serving WW1 soldier.\n\nParticularly memorable is the use of flashbacks, introduced by the eerie sound of church bells winding down, as one might slow down a gramophone record, and the historical background, including a scene of premature celebration of the end of the war.\n\nIt is sad that the director, Claude Autant-Lara, turned out to be the French equivalent of a Nazi, and you wonder if that fact has led to a virtual embargo on the film, and that is why it seems to have disappeared. That is a pity. If that criterion were applied to works of art in general then a number of books or pieces of music, or whatever, would be banned because of the activities or opinions of their creators. 'Devil in the Flesh' is a shattering masterpiece, and deserves to be seen again. It is my favourite film of all time.",

                "text": "There are - or were - probably aspiring directors who would kill for a CV like that of Claude Autant-Lara, littered as it is with such gems as Fric Frac, Douce, L'Auberge Rouge, Marguerite de la nuit, Le Ble en herbe and La Traversee de Paris to name only a handful, yet Le Diable au corps is a strong contender for his masterpiece. In the Radiguez novel the boy is several years younger than the woman and whilst Gerard Philippe and Micheline Presle were the same age - both 25 when the film was made - this is irrelevant such is the luminosity of the acting. It is doubtful whether Micheline Presle ever did anything to eclipse this despite a long and distinguished acting career. Thankfully she is still with us and still gracing the screen via cameos in her highly talented writer-director daughter, Tonie Marshall's often brilliant films whilst co-star Gerard Philippe died tragically young. Autant-Lara skillfully blends drama and lyricism and one would go a long way to find the equivalent of the scene on the river with Presle at the oars in striped jacket and picture hat as Philippe relaxes with his head on her lap. The moral climate of the time probably played its part in dictating the shot where the couple first consummate their love, the camera panning away from them and lingering on a fire which slowly bursts into full flame and a subsequent scene is shot from behind the fireplace with the flames rising gently between us, the audience, and their faces in close up. Autant-Lara uses the fire for a third time when the camera pans from Presle's death-bed to that same fire as the flames slowly dwindle to nothing. Equally inventive is Lara's handling of flashbacks which are invariably triggered via bells winding down whilst Presle's first appearance - she materializes out of a mirror into which Philippe is gazing - arguably owes something to Cocteau. This is, quite simply, a stunning film and cannot be recommended too highly.",

While I think I was between 18 and 21, I may have been older. Needless to say, I loved it. I even went to the library and read the Radiguet book on which it was based. More recently, I've searched for it on VHS and DVD. No luck. With The Charterhouse of Parma and Fanfan the Tulip now out on DVD, perhaps this one will appear soon.

                "text": "I have seen this wonderful film yesterday, in well-known theater for movie lovers, in Paris Quartier Latin.\n\nThe story is based on Raymond Radiguet's novel of same title, and, as far as I remember the book, pretty close to it.\n\nOctober 1917, in a bourgeois suburbia of Paris. Fran\u00e7ois is a 16 year old \"lyc\u00e9en\" ; in his high school, now partly an auxiliary hospital (the Great War is all around), he meets Marthe, whose mother is chief-nurse in the hospital. Marthe faints at her first contact with the wounded arriving en masse. Fran\u00e7ois supports her and express his desire to see her \"never get used to the horror\". Seeing her the day after, understanding she is going to spend the day in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois skips the classes to come along...\n\nThis film has very remarkable characteristics. The interpretation, first. Micheline Presle is impressive in the difficult part of a woman going from a submission to another, and conscious of this. She is even better than in \"Falbalas\". G\u00e9rard Philipe is quite alright, even when he has to cope with teenage attitudes (the actor is much older than the part, but very convincing nevertheless). Denise Grey and Jean Debucourt, old thespians, are a little bit declamatory but quite effective and their parts are complex enough to escape stereotypes. Palau is wonderful as Marthe's landlord, a mean old conformist. The rest of the cast is excellent, as it happened quite often in French movies of that time (let's think about the bunch of waiters in the scene at the restaurant).\n\nScenery and locations are perfect. The river and the platform, the scenes at the lake, all is fine and more than fine. Two details are wrong (one \"transparence\" and a short shot with a model river boat are the two technical flaws of the film, to me). The cinematography is very classic, even in some rather sophisticated movements of camera. The construction is classic too, the use of flash-back being far from revolutionary at this time. But all of this routine and well-crafted filming is very very effective, permitting the concentration on the story and the evolution of the characters. One word about the score, signed by Ren\u00e9 Clo\u00ebrec : a very beautiful romantic theme.\n\nOne of the great qualities of the film is the depiction of progress and variations of love, by touches, elliptic and precise. Passion burst out quite early in the 110 minutes of the film, but the writers - well then ill then well again famed Bost and Aurenche - know how to show the evolution of the lovers : Fran\u00e7ois enjoying his new power and the overwhelming, contradictory sensations it procures to him. And the writers give to Marthe the best part of their talent : shy fianc\u00e9e, then reluctant, then betrayer and would-be passionate lover, then betrayed, then true wife, then falling again, then passionate lover, she seems to understand, as soon as the events are happening, who really is the man who takes her in perdition (\"I have two children\", she said, holding Fran\u00e7ois on her pregnant woman's lap, when in the train). And she understands everything about the destiny of a woman of her time and of her condition, a future she fights anyway, albeit weakly.\n\nNow that a restored copy is available, this movie is being watchable again. Do not miss it! Do not! It's a great film.\n\nDidier_fort at hotmail.com",

In almost all cases, the occultists are depicted as frauds, although occasionally a little loophole of \"the unexplained\" is left over at the wrap-up of the plot to provide a hint of supernatural possibility. \n\nI don't expect much sympathy for the occult in such movies, and so i enjoy them for what they are, and always keep a sharp eye out for interesting costuming, historical sets, exposures of stage illusions used by fraudulent mediums, vintage or antique props (often Orientalia), and intriguing special effects meant to simulate paranormal -- or fraudulently paranormal -- events. \n\n\"The Mystic Circle Murder\" is the name under which i obtained this film (from Alpha Video), although i understand that its original title was \"Religious Racketeers\" -- and those two titles immediately reveal the problem of the plot: it serves two masters. Is it a murder mystery -- or an expose of religious rackets? It tries to be both, but straddling the fence leaves scant screen-time for either plot to unfold to its full possible extent. \n\nBetty Compson is really good as a woman slowly destroyed by love for a man who has cast her aside, but then along comes the widow of Harry Houdini (whose scenes look spliced in, as she has virtually no interaction with the rest of the cast), and we are suddenly watching a moralizing educational film about fake psychics and their tricks. \n\nI consider this a very interesting movie that will appeal greatly to those with a special interest in films about the international occult community and/or stage magic during the 1930s -- but for many other folks, i think it will simply register as another B-film from a cheap studio.",

The scientist, however, is undeterred and proceeds to draw another comet to Earth. The police interfere and disrupt the telescope's generator, causing the power to go out. Now there's a comet hurtling towards Metropolis with no way to stop it. Superman does his super best but it's no use. He manages to restart the generator and then, in one of the greatest scenes from the entire Fleischer Superman series, he holds together two cut ends of wire and allows his own body to conduct the electric current needed to power the telescope.\n\nA fun, fast-paced entry in the series.

While the picture had so many of the hallmarks that were an integral part of the SUPERMAN Cartoons format, it seems to have a certain freshness of presentation that sets it as a stand-out in the fine series.\n\nDEVELOPING the story as the work of a misguided, only slightly mad (perhaps just \"fatigued\" from slaving at his telescope), but not evil research astronomer; the story became the tale of technological discoveries outstripping our ability to safely use it in a controlled situation.

His Mt. Palomar look-alike stronghold is invaded by Miss Lois Lane and the usual interplay occurs between Miss Lane, Superman and the Scientist.

But later, at the burial, a mysterious veiled mourner hitches a ride home with family lawyer Hugh Beaumont and reveals herself to be the presumed contents of the casket.\n\nShe does her own version of the dance of the seven veils by dramatically appearing to her various survivors, who greet her re-emergence with a multicolored outbursts of consternation, shock and relief.  (Lockhart's such a sweetie she can't bring this off with the panache it demands.)  Among the surprised are her husband Mark Daniels, whom she suspects of setting the fire, and her spoiled and wilful kid sister Cathy O'Donnell (who oddly takes top billing).  One by one, they and others relate to the police, in flashback, their own recollections of the night of the fire.  One big question remains: Whose remains were laid to rest?\n\nStarting off with a great premise \u0096 the fantasy of being present at one's own funeral \u0096 Bury Me Dead soon finds itself running low on ingenuity.  Not completely out, just low.  On the plus side, it boasts expectedly fine cinematography courtesy of John Alton, just before he embarked upon his legendary collaboration with director Anthony Mann.  But here the director was Bernard Vorhaus, nearing the end of his humdrum career if not of his life, which would last almost half a century after his last movie (he fell victim to the Hollywood blacklist and relocated to England).\n\nIn a style inexplicably popular in crime programmers of the late \u009130s and early \u009140s, Vorhaus decides to leaven the homicides with laughs.  Yet Bury Me Dead manages to pull short of the brink of one of those ghastly slapstick mysteries \u0096 not by much, but still short.  (As a beef-witted prizefighter, Greg McClure shoulders most of the ungainly comedy on his very broad frame.)  With its pleasant but low-voltage cast getting little extra juice from Vorhaus, Bury Me Dead doesn't quite count as forgotten treasure, even by the forgiving standards of nostalgia buffs and film-noir freaks.  But it's not a disaster, either, in length and appeal about as comfy and silly as an old episode of Simon & Simon or Matlock padded out for a slot on TV after the late local newscast..",

Compact at under 70 minutes, it's a film that, under Bernard Vorhaus' guidance, just doesn't know if to play it as straight or straight out murder mystery comedy. Something further enhanced by Cadkin's musical score, which, quite frankly, belongs in an Abbott and Costello movie. However, the film rises above average because the script is actually strong and John Alton weaves some magic with his photographic lenses.\n\nNarratively it's a good who done it? The mystery is strong and the reveal is not easy to guess from the off, though in fairness the comedy moments in the flashbacks kind of distract you from any detective work you want to partake in! But coupled with some sharp lines given to Lockhart, who delivers them with a scorpion like sting, it's well written stuff. Yet without doubt it's Alton's work that makes this well worth viewing, whenever the film gets indoors the film takes on another dimension. Alton creates stark images at every turn, angled shadows everywhere, the whites ghostly and the darks deathly black. The last 15 minutes of the film are played out on this atmospheric stage and it's everything that a Alton fan could want. Even if it ultimately is work that deserves a far, far better film. 6/10",

It's a great audience 'hook'. So now June Lockhart must find out who among her circle tried to kill her. And, oh yeah, just who did they bury in her place.\n\nTrouble is the movie gets pretty ragged from that point on. Director Vorhaus can't seem to make up his mind whether he's directing noir or pratfall comedy. The boxer, for example, is straight out of an Abbott & Costello romp. Add Mark Daniel's really erratic acting, plus Sonia Darrin's shaky turn, and an otherwise interesting mystery gets regrettably undercut. \n\nCredit the rest of the cast for carrying on well despite the handicaps. Credit too, John Alton's expert noir photography for heightening the mystery part, even as it clashes with the ill- advised pratfalls. Too bad, as another reviewer points out, that a director like Mann or Losey didn't get the promising material first. Anyway, it's a good chance to see how well Lassie's mom gets along with Beaver Cleaver's dad away from TV.",

The lead, June Lockhart, and the little-known Mark Daniels, plus the appropriately cast Rev. Hugh Beaumont, also contribute strong performances. But in addition to the suspenseful script, the intriguing acting and the moody direction, the film makes excellent use of the trend-setting talents of John Alton, one of Hollywood's most admired (by actors, producers, directors and fellow cinematographers) and most reviled (by grips, electricians and other lighting technicians) cameramen. In this one, Alton's moody black and white photography captures the essence, the excitement, the emotional suspense of film noir to a \"T\".",

The best things about it are the cinematography (courtesy of the legendary John Alton) and the participation of the two female leads: June Lockhart (her role is not too dissimilar from that of SHE-WOLF OF London [1946] \u0096 she was on the point of being driven mad in the latter film, while here she's the object of murder, and the reason for both is her inheritance) and Cathy O'Donnell (actually top-billed but her role is subsidiary to Lockhart's \u0096 from what little I've read about it, her character has been played up as a femme fatale but she's really just a mixed-up kid, recalling the Martha Vickers of THE BIG SLEEP [1946]). Having mentioned THE BIG SLEEP, Sonia Darrin (who played the sharp-tongued bookstore clerk with whom private detective Elisha Cook Jr. was enamored) appears in BURY ME DEAD as an ill-fated schemer.\n\nOn the other hand, the male lead (Hugh Beaumont) is pretty bland \u0096 despite being deceived, beaten up and accused of murder, he keeps an incongruous jovial countenance throughout! Nonetheless, the suspense sequences towards the end are moderately well-handled (though the patronizing, thick-headed police inspector character is decidedly overbearing).\n\nWith regards to the renamed TV version, it runs a mere 27 minutes against the original 68: whole subplots are omitted, as well as most of the flashback sequences; consequently, it makes little sense \u0096 and, really, is only worth watching once for the sake of curiosity. Unfortunately, the print on the VCI DVD left a lot to be desired (the company's output over the years, while undeniably earnest, has also been alarmingly sloppy!): the audio was especially problematic with the presence of excessive pops and crackles (ironically, these didn't plague the Condensed Version as much) and, most bafflingly, a complete audio drop-out for a few seconds of dialogue!!",

Instead of Noir (which the DVD box claimed it was), the film actually tried to be a bit of a comedy--with some very broad humor involving Lockhart's husband getting punched several times by a dim-witted boxer. The film just failed at every turn to take a promising beginning and make something exciting out of it. Certainly placing BAD comedy into the film seemed totally inappropriate and stupid. In fact, the film also featured (along with an awful script) some pretty poor acting and direction. While this film isn't bad enough to be enjoyed by bad movie aficionados, it is bad enough not to be enjoyable to anyone...except, perhaps, masochists.

Given these tragic circumstances one may be tempted to praise the final French film irrespective of whether or not it was up to snuff but I'm delighted to say that it is an excellent effort even if a tad derivative - a few years earlier Julien Duvivier had made one of his finest films as well as one of the finest of the thirties, Un Carnet de bal, in which a middle-aged woman sets out to trace the partners on her first dance card; now,with a little spin Harry Baur, acutely aware of time's winged chariot drawing near, sets out on a similar quest but in this case his quarries are the four sons he fathered by four separate women in his salad days. Predictably things don't go to plan but we do get four well-crafted stories for the price of one and as if that weren't enough the ubiquitous Gabrielle Fontan is on hand to add a touch of class. Baur was a credit to the French film industry and is as irreplaceable as Raimu, Michel Simon or Gabin and his final French film leaves an enduring memory",

There's some fairly standard fare here, including the Bagel Street/Susquehanna Hat routine, while the romantic chores are handled by future TV Sky King, Kirby Grant wooing the lovely Marion Hutton, who goes by the unlikely name of Elsie Hammerdingle. Her character is a female taxi driver, and along with the boys, rides out this comedy in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nWhen an expensive painting depicting \"The Plunger\" winds up missing at the society affair, the boys become likely suspects when their plumber identities become known. The painting is recovered following a well choreographed chase scene in which Bud and Lou hop aboard a conveniently placed hook and ladder rig. There's some innovative stunt driving featuring a handful of near misses with oncoming traffic. When it's all over, the weekend hostess quite proudly proclaims - \"You may be plumbers, but you're wonderful plumbers!\"",

Without plumbers King reasoned, we'd all be astronauts. But when you hire Abbott&Costello as plumbers you'd better be checked out in a space suit.\n\nBumbling plumbers Bud and Lou after wrecking the home of Thurston Hall and Nella Walker get invited to a big society bash when they get that instead of a threatening letter from Walker. When they went to that job they got a lift from their friend, Rosie the Riveteer cab driver Marion Hutton who was mistaken for a society girl in costume by Kirby Grant who was similarly attired. So begins Marion's Cinderella like odyssey.\n\nIn fact Marion and Kirby are given a great deal more screen footage than you would normally expect in an Abbott&Costello feature. I'm guessing that Universal was trying to turn Hutton into a big film star the way Paramount was doing with her older sister Betty. Marion was a lighter and sweeter version of Betty, maybe if she had a more distinct personality of her own she might have had a film career. In any event she was more interested in singing than acting. She got a couple of really good songs to sing, No Bout Adoubt It is in the style of her sister. And one of the big song hits of 1944 was introduced by Marion with My Dreams Are Getting Better All The Time. Television's future Sky King also has a fine number with What A Change In The Weather. This should prove a pleasant surprise to his fans who probably didn't know Kirby Grant started as a singer.\n\nBut Bud and Lou get their innings as well here as they make an ungodly mess of Thurston Hall's lovely home. And they do one of burlesque's celebrated routines, the famous Susquehanna Hat Company on Beagle Street. Who could possibly believe that such horrific events in people's lives could have happened on that street or been connected with that hat company?\n\nThe last chase sequence as society crook Thomas Gomez tries to steal a valuable painting on the fire engine is re-edited from W.C. Fields's Never Give A Sucker An Even Break. You'll recognize it of course if you are a fan of Fields, but it is certainly edited nicely into In Society. \n\nThis is one of the best A&C films from their early Universal period, a must for their still growing legion of fans.",

As I said, this is odd because people came to see Abbott and Costello and comedy--not production numbers and singing. Fortunately, this one has less singing than most but it still is the same old formula.\n\nIn this film, Abbott and Costello are idiot plumbers. One day, they are called to fix the plumbing at a mansion where there is a big society party. They make a mess of it but somehow are invited to the next party as guests! The two, in particular Lou, make a mess of things as they hang with the gentry. In addition to the silliness, there is a subplot involving a friend of theirs (a pretty young cab driver) who is also mistaken for a society lady, though this plot is 100% unnecessary and seems to have been added because the studio STILL couldn't trust an entire film to rest on the shoulders of Abbott and Costello--an odd thing, as they were the hottest thing in Hollywood at the time. Such romantic subplots are the norm for the early Universal films that the team made.\n\nIn addition to all this, a crook tries to insinuate himself into the party. He also tries to get the boys to help him with his scheme to steal a painting, though naturally they refuse and help to thwart his wicked plan. However, the final big fight scene is exceptionally lame--the result of using an obvious rear-projected film to hide that it was all done on the set. This \"clever\" ruse was in fact pretty sad at times.\n\nThere is also an old vaudeville skit in the film that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. It's about taking a load of hats to Bagel Street and the Susquehanna Hat Company. The Three Stooges later did the same routine and I suspect many have done it over the years (including Lou for the \"Abbott and Costello Show\" on television). This version seems to be the best and although it's pretty stupid, you can't help but laugh! Overall, it's a mixed bag--a lot of laughs AND some stupid singing and low points as well. Worth seeing for Abbott and Costello fans but skipable for most others.",

Todays propaganda usually has to be far more subtle and careful than that of WW2 to get the government line out, but ultimately it's the same: America good, China bad etc. My line is: every country good, every country bad.\n\nThis episodic film starts with T for Tommy (keen as mustard Michael Rennie and nonchalant John Mills) flying out to night bomb Hanover, later doing it and returning. In between there's lots of various naval action and detailed earnest explanation of the how and why of the British economic blockade of Nazi Germany. We're repeatedly shown how useless and demoralised the Germans were getting under War conditions, when the Blockade was taking effect and even their ersatz products were failing them. Sadly though Hitler hung on for another savage 5 years. Lots of big and little British stars have bit parts here: Leslie Banks as a super organiser at the Minstry of Economic Warfare, Michael Redgrave as a humorous Russian in Germany, Will Hay and Bernard Miles have an intense 3 minutes fighting off the Luftwaffe from on board ship, Robert Morley as a frothing Nazi officer, Ronald Shiner has 2 seconds as a shipping clerk in a phone box, George Woodbridge as half the man he later became. And many others. Was that a woman's voice dubbed onto the man at the Bunawerke production meeting, and if so why?!\n\nThe \"vicious intrigues of the Capitalist-British-Jewish Empire\" are still a major concern to a lot of people today \u0096 mainly British passport holders though! This was a film made solely for 1940, and is a great window on the thought-processes of the time, if not the truth.

That's pretty much the plot here as \"Detour's\" Ann Savage arrives way up north from San Francisco with proof that she was left the very popular saloon where Glenda Farrell and her girls have showed up as performers. They were initially hired by the rather shady Sheldon Leonard to work in his saloon but ending up working for Tom Neal who refuses to acknowledge Savage's claim. Her presence incurs the wrath of the saloon's established solo singer, Constance Worth, who is in cahoots with Leonard to take over the establishment himself. A card game between Leonard and Neal leaves the future of the establishment in doubt, and when murder in the Klondike occurs, it's up to Savage and Neal (who have obviously gone past the stage of rivals to become lovers) to prove his innocence.\n\nAn acceptable semi-musical adventure, this is very remnant of both \"Belle of the Yukon\" and \"The Harvey Girls\", even though it came out first. It lacks the camp quality of director William Castle's later horror films but is certainly a curio considering its leading stars who only two years later would create screen history as very different partners in the film noir cult classic \"Detour\". Glenda Farrell gets in a few good bitchy lines, while George Cleveland is amusing as the attorney whom Savage hires to represent her and ironically ends up as a the judge in the case. What keeps this from being just average is the fact that its story abruptly ends without wrapping up the identity of the killer. The audience knows, but the writers don't allow the characters involved know, and that leads to a total let-down.",

                "text": "Like a previous reviewer I have also only ever seen this film surface once. This was on TV here in Australia, possibly in the early 80s or a little earlier. My memory of it is that it was a satire come comedy come espionage thriller which I enjoyed immensely, despite the low one and a half star rating that I remember seeing in the current edition of Maltin at the time. I have wanted to see it again ever since, but have not had much luck in tracking a copy down. It was advertised for sale as a DVD item from a now defunct (or so I believe) internet vendor, but when I actually received the DVD it was some kind of rap music video with the same title! But I digress.\n\nThis was John Barrymore's next to last feature. (His last was Playmates in support of Kay Kyser!) It was during this period that Barrymore's career was in decline, and his roles were inclined to humorous self parody. While his performance here does not plumb the depths of self- caricature the way his role in Playmates does for example, my memory of the performance here is nevertheless along similar lines. Unlike many who find these and other similar roles towards the end of his career a demeaning waste of his talents, I actually enjoy THIS John Barrymore more than the posturing ham of his earlier years. Don't get me wrong folks...I appreciate the earlier works more than somewhat...it's just that I enjoy all of Barrymore's roles from the last few years of his career a lot more. (Am still waiting to see Hold That Co-ed by the way, which seems to be a starting point of sorts for these kind of Barrymore flicks).\n\nParamount had apparently lost interest in Frances Farmer by this time in her career, as they appear to have been relegating her to their B features or loaning her out to other studios. Her last two Paramount pics appear to be this and Among the Living, the latter being yet another film I am also waiting to see again after close to 40 years, a very fine dramatic thriller containing one of Albert Dekker's finest early performances. In any event Miss Farmer, who could be a very effective actress, was certainly not put to much worthwhile use in World Premiere as I have very little memory of her at all from this film.\n\nWhich brings me to the real stars of World Premiere and the main reason for watching it, Fritz Feld and Sig Rumann. Though nominally only supporting players they really do steal the film, and it is such a pleasure seeing them with far more sizeable roles than the mere walk-ons in which they were frequently cast. It has always been my contention that what gave the Golden Years of Hollywood their gold was the large reservoir of wonderful supporting character players which could always be drawn upon, and these two guys are among my favourites.\n\nHoping whoever owns the MCA library now will make this available again some time, but given the track record of MCA and Universal titles that seem to have sunk into oblivion, I am not holding my breath.",

Most of this shapeless movie concentrates on the shenanigans of Nazi Fritz Feld and De Grasses annoying double talking side kick who reminded me of one of Dick Dastardly's cohorts. The story for what it's worth deals with the desperate producer/director's attempt to drum up publicity for his newest movie, one of a long line of disastors.\n\nThis movie is such a waste of time, even for Barrymore addicts, who'll feel short changed and bored by all the subplots. Admittedly the last scene with various critics trying to make sense of the chopped up film De Grasse finally premieres is quite droll. Otherwise avoid.\n",

                "text": "\nThis is without a doubt the worst Lee Tracy movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot because his movies tend to be of a consistently high quality.  This movie verges on being MST3K fodder, and if you're familiar with that show, you can easily imagine Crow, Tom Servo, and Joel (or Mike) wisecracking their way through this dopey, racist, tedious, half-baked war-era nonsense.  Okay, I know the historical context in which it was made, it was well-meaning propaganda from 1945; but no matter how many times I told myself this during the course of the movie, it didn't improve it any, or make it any more entertaining.\n\n\nThe plot is typical double-agent fluff, about some seemingly amoral carnival barker, who, when paid a pile by the perfidious Japanese to spy against the good ol' U.S. of A., shows himself to be a True Blue Patriot and ends up giving his all for the cause. There's badly staged fight scenes, corny torture scenes, plenty of inscrutable villains staring meaningfully at each other, and a couple of love scenes which were blatant- and badly done- ripoffs of \"Casablanca.\"  Most annoying is the narration by journalist Drew Pearson at the beginning and end of the film.  Evidently the director had such a low opinion of his audience's IQ, he felt the need to need to hammer in his message more with stentorian sermonizing acting as bookends.  It wasn't enough to show us the Japanese were our enemies; did they have to tell us too?  Was the director so afraid that we would just not get it otherwise?\n\nLee Tracy plays the carnival barker in question (shades of his earlier, and much better film, the \"Half Naked Truth\").  What is remarkable is how grim and stoic he appears throughout the entire film; much different from his customary ebullience, rapid-fire wisecracking and handwaving.  His boredom and weary indifference virtually radiate from every frame of this misbegotten motion picture, as if he knew how this whole enterprise was imminently undeserving of his talents.  He keeps repeating, \"I'm just doin' this for the dough,\" as if it were his own personal mantra, and it leaves one to think that that was his main reason behind this picture as well. His attentions to Nancy Kelly, his alleged love interest, are lacking in any conviction whatsoever, and for the most part he seems more excited by the thought of his paycheck.  As for Nancy Kelly, she provides a good argument against child stardom; although 24 at the time this film was made, this former child star appears a good 10 to 15 years older, and her strained posture and exaggerated, flutey voice don't help her.   She does however provide one of the most amusing moments of the film, when (**SPOILER**) the bad guys steam her to death in a sauna.\n\nGood propaganda gets its point by showing, not telling; and by providing its audience with a fun, compelling and interesting story.  \"Betrayal from the East\" does neither.  Recommended only for students of the period or die-hard Lee Tracy fans.\n\n",

In America, Japanese secret agent Kato approaches former soldier Eddie Carter to recruit him to report back the details of the Panama Canal. Eddie is down on his luck and working as an announcer in a tacky fair sideshow and he agrees to help them for a big payday. However he quickly has his doubts and finds himself in the position to do the right thing for the US and act as a double agent.\n\nWith lots of talk about \"Japs\" and the title sequence involving a typical \"yellow menace\" image of a Japanese man it is no surprise that this thriller is very much a simple propaganda film. Presented by newsman Drew Pearson, we are told the story of how \"friendly\" Japanese in America are really spies, not to be trusted, who use their cunning and sweet talk to win over a typically good American to make him betray his country. Unsurprisingly the drama is as simple as the characters and although it works well enough on the level of an engaging piece of propaganda it doesn't have too much to make it stick in the mind; with perhaps a late scene of steam bath torture being the one exception. It goes where you expect it to and it moves forward without the pace and tension that I would have liked but, like I said, as a simple propaganda thriller it just about does enough.\n\nThe cast match this approach by being solid but nothing more. Lee Tracy is a cookie-cutter all-American Joe who does \"the right thing\" and opens all our eyes to the fact that no Japanese people in America can be trusted. He is OK but I wonder does he regret his role given what happened to Japanese Americans around this period? Kelly is alright and Ahn and Biberman do their usual roles in American films from the time but generally they all turn in the type of solid performances that one would expect to find in this type of thing.\n\nOverall this is an OK but unmemorable thriller that is heavy with propaganda and a sense of fear-driven rabble-rousing. It more or less works as a simple b-movie but it is hard to totally get into it when looking back with hindsight and modern eyes and seeing the clear racism and very broad strokes used to present clean-cut white heroes and smarmy, untrustworthy yellow devils.",

                "text": "When RKO released \"Betrayal from the East,\" World War II was into its waning days. Nevertheless, the Japanese are portrayed as vicious, omniscient antagonists with the Nazis running a close second in this tale about pr-Pearl Harbor espionage. A couple of Americans in Tokyo have gotten hold of some volatile information about high-ranking Japanese military officials in the United States, but they are killed before they can get the information to U.S. military intelligence referred to here as G-2. One of the Americans\u0097a leading newspaperman\u0097dies from a mysterious fall while the other vanishes into the ocean on his voyage to San Francisco. It seems that the wily Japanese want information about the Panama Canal so that they can shut down the canal and prevent the U.S. from shipping men, munitions, and ships through this important point. That's when carnival barker Eddie (Lee Tracy of \"Bombshell\") finds himself lured into the story. The Japanese contact the wise-talking Eddie and he assures them that he was not only stationed in the Canal Zone during his six years in the Army but also that he knows a sergeant who can get him to the plans to the zone. The Japanese pay his expenses on the way south to the canal. Before they set out for Panama, they show him what they do to double agents. We see a gardener that the villains have captured and Eddie watches for a moment or two as they try to sweat information out of him then approach him\u0097the gardener\u0097with the glowering end of a steel rod. Later, Eddie learns that an attractive clothing designer that he met on the train trip to L.A. was another agent. Although he has made a deal with the Japanese, Eddie goes to G-2 and they reveal that they have been tailing him the entire time. Despite the threat of torture and execution, our intrepid hero decides to play along with the Japanese. Unfortunately, the scenarists have written Eddie as a dim-witted idiot who finds himself in over his head and makes virtually every mistake that can be made. Meanwhile, the Japanese villains are portrayed as experts and nothing is too devious for them. \"Betrayal from the East\" is the kind of Hollywood propaganda that the studios churned out to the chagrin of the U.S. Office of War Information (O.W.I.) during World War II that painted the Japanese as double-crossing, back-stabbing dastards. Along the way, the clothing designer Peggy Harrison (Nancy Kelly of \"Tarzan's Desert Mystery\") falls in love with Eddie and stages her own death to protect from the Japanese. Actually, the Japanese placed a camera in Eddie's apartment so they knew that Harrison was a U.S. spy. When Eddie reaches the Canal Zone, he meets with an Army sergeant (Regis Toomey) who is impersonating the Eddie's fictitious friend and they arrange to pass the Japanese false, out-of-date Canal Zone defense plans. Prolific scenarist Audrey Wisberg and director William A. Berke then pull a real boner by reinserting the Harrison character back into the story in the Canal Zone (much to Eddie's surprise and consternation as a woman with impeccable credentials who is a Nazi agent's girlfriend. The Japanese suspect the Harrison character from the get-go as untrustworthy and eventually the Nazis come around to their way of thinking. Peggy blows her cover when she warns Eddie about a plot to murder him by his Japanese employers. Yes, Eddie is so incredibly cretinous that he does things that a four-year old would never do when he tries to outwit the Japanese. Now, \"Betrayal from the East\" not only kills off both Peggy (she dies in a sauna bath) but also the chief Japanese villain (Chinese actor Richard Loo) kills Eddie just as G-2 breaks down the door. Journalist Drew Pearson appears in a prologue where he warns Americans that this kind of treachery must never happen again. Actually, if you want to see this story done with great credibility and more dramatic impact, watch the Warner Brothers 1942 release \"Across The Pacific\" with Humphrey Bogart where he strings along with Japanese saboteurs who want similar information about the Canal Zone.",

                "text": "***SPOILER*** Shocking expose of an attempted Japanese take-over of the United States west-coast by a gang of Japanese spies and their American counterparts, ethnic Japanese Americans. Based on the 1943 block-buster book \"Betrayal from the East\" by Alan Hynd the movie shows how closed we, the USA, was in being taken over from within. \n\nGetting wind of the massive Japanese conspiracy in early 1941 US Embassy officials in Tokyo Marsden & Hildebrand, Louis James Hyde & Jason Robards Sr, try to warn Washington and the US military about it but end up dead; Marsden falling overboard on a Japanese passenger ship going back to the states and Hildebrand falling to his death from a high-rise building in Tokyo.\n\nIn charge of this conspiracy back in the USA is the UCLA Football teams lead cheerleader Tani who's really Japanese Lt. Cmdr. Miyazaki, Richard Loo, and his band of Japanese agents led by Kato & Yamato, Philip Ahn & Abner Biberman. Kato gets in contact with his American friend and girlie show barker Eddie Carter, Lee Tracy, who served in the US military in the Panama Canal Zone a major target of Japanese Imperial Navy in the event of a war with the US.\n\nEddie broke and in need of cash quirky falls for Kato's offer to pay him for information abut US defenses in the Panama Canal and even gives him the name of a friend of his Sgt. Scott, who like Eddie is broke and willing to sell out his county for a few dollars, who still stationed there for further references. Little does Kato and his boss the secretive Lt. Cmdr. Miyazki know is that there's no such person as Sgt. Scott and that Eddie is setting him and his fellow spies up to be taken out and caught by the US military and FBI.\n\nEddie is later contacted by Peggy Harrison, Nancy Kelly, an undercover G-2, the forerunner to the CIA, agent on a train trip to L.A about the Japanses conspiracy. Told b Peggy to play along with his Japanese cohorts in order to find out what their up to she's later exposed as a G-2 undercover agent when Kato plants a hidden camera in Eddie's apartment. Peggy together with Eddie's and his Japanese house boy Omaya,Victor Sen Young, are secretly working with the G-2 US military Intelligence Agency. \n\nGrabing Omaya the Japanese spies force Eddie to witness him being tortured and murdered by them to strike home to him what's to happen to anyone who cross' them. Peggy now knowing, from Eddie, that the Japanese spies are on to her has herself run over,in a G-2 staged accident,in order to make them think that she's dead.\n\nEddie is now given a ticket, on a Japanese freighter, to travel to the Canal Zone and get in contact with Sgt. Scott and get the vital information about US defenses there back to Lt. Cmdr. Miyazki. The whole operation is being monitored by the US military with a phony Sgt. Scott, Regis Toomey, planted there to make the Japanese spies feel that both Eddie, as an American traitor and spy for Japan, and Sgt. Scott, a real flesh and blood person, are legit.\n\nGetting in touch with his Japanese contact in the Canal Zone a Mr. Araki, Dr. Hugh Ho Chang, Eddie is told to get all the information he can from Sgt. Scott about it's, the US military in the Canal Zone, defenses. Eddie also finds out that the \"dead\" Peggey Harrison is very much alive vacationing there undercover as a German tourist named Sandra Borough who not only changed her name but her hair, she dyed it blond obviously to look more Aryan,and blows her cover when she foolishly rekindles her love affair with him. This leads to Peggy being caught by the Japanese spies, and together with their German allies, boiled to death in a steam or Turkish bath.\n\nEddie has it out at the end of the movie with Lt.Cmdr. Miyazaki and even though he does the UCLA cheerleader in he ends up losing his life but eventually stops Miyazki's master plan to bring down he US with a coordinated outside Japanese military and inside Japanese sabotage assault on America.\n\nThe movie \"Betrayal from the East\" is done in a \"Now it can be told\" style narrative with syndicated columnist Drew Pearson inserted into the film giving it's both prologue and epilogue. Pearson telling the audience how close we were from being taken over by the Japanese Empire really hits home.\n\nFor all the Japanese meticulous planning it all in the end came apart because of the bravery and self-sacrifice of men and women like Eddie Carter and Peggy Harrison who put, and lost, their lives on the line in order to stop them.",

Rancher Gene Autry becomes involved when he uncovers a scheme by land baron Charlie Mason (Ralph Morgan) to cheat the local ranchers out of their land by pitting the Indians and ranchers against each other. Mason, with the help of his equally criminally inclined son (Mark Daniels) try to undermine peacemaker Gene's credibility with both sides as he attempts to help resolve the dispute, \n\nThis was Gene's maiden voyage for Columbia Pictures. He had just wrapped up a five picture deal with Republic to settle a contract dispute. The move to Columbia gave him a chance to produce a more expansive, higher budget western, which this one is. At a running time of 77 minutes this is one of his longer films. \"The Last Round-up\" also marked a turning point in the focus and content of Gene's westerns. His previous five post-war Republic pictures were an uneven bunch, playing out more like 1930's screwball comedies or contemporary dramas. \"The Last Round-up\" was a welcome relief. Directed by John English, it definitely has a more somber feel than his prior movies, though Gene does get in four or five tunes to retain some of the feel of his earlier works. \n\nBeginning with this movie through 1951's \"Hills of Utah\", Gene's westerns, directed by English are arguably the best he ever did, before eventually succumbing to higher production costs. After watching this movie it's clear Gene got the message change was in the air. His films, for the larger part, adopted a more earthy, socially themed format that reflected the progressive thinking of post-war America. Under English's direction the comic sidekick role was toned down or in some cases eliminated and the Fairytale Automobile-age set was transitioned to a more contemporary type western. Gene's ability to sense the change in public sentiment goes a long way to explain his success not only in movies but in his business ventures and other areas of life. As an indication of things soon to come, Gene uses the new medium of television in this movie to broadcast his message to the Indian Tribe. The same medium in which he would be a pioneer within a few short years. \n\nRanks up there with Gene's best. 8 of 10*",

Columbia studios gave productions like this many more resources than the average Autry programmer. There's lots of action, some good desert backgrounds plus alpine scenery. The plot's more complex than usual but minus many tiresome clich\u00e9s. I really like the amusing classroom version of \"She'll be Comin' 'round the Mountain\". It's charmingly done. Also, I had to look twice to make sure that was an actual TV broadcasting in the Stone Age of TV, 1947, and in a western, no less. \n\nNote that there's no buffoonish comedy relief that came to identify Autry's later programmers with kids entertainment. In fact, the movie's good enough to be considered a B-western instead of a matin\u00e9e programmer. Note too the presence of a young Bobby Blake as Mike. Whatever his adult transgressions, he was certainly an affecting child star. All in all, the movie's a superior entry in the Autry series.",

The Indians are being swindled by a wealthy rancher and his son. Autry followed up on that two years later with \"The Cowboy and the Indians,\" another very fine Western.\n\nIn particular, the head villain's murder of Gene's friend, an Indian husband and father, leads to the climactic scene of the movie where Autry captures the baddie after a thrilling horseback chase and a heckuva fist fight.\n\nThe movie's songs are good ones, especially the title song, performed by the star at the funeral for his Indian friend. And Gene's riding and fight scenes are first-rate -- and are almost certainly all done by himself. Gene could do his own stunts, and liked to, when permitted by the director in charge. And he was a very skilled horseman -- which is virtually never acknowledged by the regular reviewers, with their talk of \"a typical Autry oater,\" \"forgettable songs,\" etc. He was America's Favorite Cowboy, folks.

These films, however, seem to go on too long, and are not suspensefully edited or fast paced.\n\nThis one, though, is marked by some interesting elements, and has a little bit more action than Gene's later ones when the older 50s Gene fades into the background as he does in 'Sons of New Mexico' (1950), which really centers around Dick Jones / Dick West. Actually partially shot in Tucson, Arizona, 'The Last Round-Up' centers around Gene's helping the local Indians (the name Navajo is not mentioned).\n\nThere are several good musical numbers, especially the long and slow version of 'The Last Round Up' towards the end; Gene singing with the Texas Ramblers on several songs; Gene's version of Bing Crosby's 1937 hit 'An Apple for the Teacher'; and a slow barn dance version of 'Red River Valley' and school kids singing 'She'll Be Comin Round the Mountain' in their classroom with Bobby and Gene.\n\nTo help the Indians, Gene is even shown on a TV show broadcast to 'the old red school house' in his pitch to get them to move to a beautiful valley. Robert 'Bobby' Blake has a prominent role, somehow looking older than he did in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' (1948).\n\nEven though this one is a LONG 77 minutes, I enjoyed the musical numbers; so I'll give it a four and half.",

                "text": "Of all the films done by Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (except, possibly, \"Sea Of Grass\" and their last film, \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner - the latter for a different reason), \"Keeper Of The Flame\" was the great downer among the Hepburn - Tracy romps. \"Sea Of Grass\" has a portrait of a ruthless western cattle baron played by Tracy, whose happiness is marred by Kate's dalliance with Melvyn Douglas and the actual provenance of his \"son\" Robert Walker (who dies in his arms). \"Guess\", of course, was saddened by the decline in Tracy's health, visible in several scenes, and that last moving speech about his passions for Hepburn remaining even in his old age. But \"Keeper\" ends with Hepburn's death. As pointed out elsewhere on this thread it was rare for Hepburn to die in her film (\"Christopher Strong\" and \"Mary of Scotland\" come to mind as exceptions preceding \"Keeper\"...few came afterward too).\n\nActually \"Keeper of the Flame\" is more than just the sole tragic film of the Tracy - Hepburn series. It is their only joint attempt at a film noir. It is also a thinly disguised discussion of one of the most controversial heroes of 20th Century American History: Charles Augustus Lindbergh.\n\nRobert Forrest is a great national hero, whose very existence gave the reporter Steve O'Malley (Tracy) a warm, glowing feeling when he was abroad, studying the mess in Europe and Asia. With people like Forrest at home, O'Malley felt that America had nothing to fear about it's security and freedom. Then, like most Americans, he was shocked and saddened to hear that Forrest was killed in a car accident on his estate. He is sent to the estate on an assignment, and intends to do a bit of personal research to give a proper final magazine monument to his hero's memory. But he meets Forrest's widow Christine (Hepburn) and finds that her behavior is odd - and not very upset at the death of the great man. He notes her interest in her cousin Geoff Midford (Forrest Tucker), which seems too close for decency. Also he notes how Forrest's \"agreeable\" secretary Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf) acts with a degree of secrecy and even threat towards Christine.\n\n\"Keeper Of The Flame\" never really makes Forrest an exact copy of Lindbergh. After all, the \"Lone Eagle\" was still alive in 1942, and capable of suing MGM. But it leaves at least one \"Lindbergh\" trace in Forrest's background, which most people would not notice unless they read the recent novel by Philip Roth \"The Plot Against America\". Roth has the Republicans, in 1940, nominate Lindbergh to run against FDR, and Lindbergh wins. This keeps us out of World War II, and it turns our country into a neo-Fascist state. In actuality, Lindbergh was suggested as a Vice Presidential candidate to run with Wendell Wilkie, but he did not get that nomination. If you listen to Whorf's dialog, at one point he is willing to allow Tracy hear a recording of Forrest's speech at the 1940 convention rejecting that nomination.\n\nBut there is no mention of how Forrest became such a national hero - certainly nothing about aviation. And there is no mention of any children with Christine who got kidnapped and murdered. As I said, the studio did not want to be sued. But the unpleasant experience of Lindbergh's American First crusade, culminating in his notorious \"Des Moines\" speech where he hinted at Jewish influence to push the U.S. into war, was sufficient to make the character of Forrest stand for only one other American.\n\nThe slow revelation of Forrest's true character, his egomania and arrogance - his embrace of fascism for power, and his huge following with other malcontents is done well. Of course, today, seeing the film and knowing it's reputation, the effect of the slow revelations is not as effective as in it's original release in 1942. Best moment in this is Margaret Wycherley's as Forrest's senile mother - but a senile woman whose character is as bent as her son's. Notice her comments about the size of houses.\n\nHepburn's performance, of the two leads, is weaker - she does show her everlasting intelligence as Christine, but little of the passion that guides her to do what she has to do. Tracy is better - he is a true believer in the cult of Forrest, and his disillusionment is painful (\"Robert Forrest...what happened?\"). But for my money it is Whorf's performance which is the best, because of his quiet fanaticism in protecting the great man's secret, and his menace towards Hepburn. If one only thinks of Whorf as Sam Harris in \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (which he made the same year), this performance is a revelation of his strength as a dramatic actor. Whorf had a short life (he died in the 1960s), and gradually became a film and television director. He could have remained a very effective dramatic actor.",

At the time of its release, it received mixed reviews at best. I, personally, was quite moved by it. Now, 53 years later, I've seen it again. Although the film is a bit dated and its central theme was better hyped at the time of its release, I believe it holds up fairly well. The film concerns itself with blind hero worship, as a mesmerized nation mourns the sudden accidental death of a national icon. A much respected reporter (Spencer Tracy), just back from Europe where he's witnessed the early horrors of World War II prior to U.S. entry into the conflict, has arrived just after the great man's tragic auto accident. He decides to write the hero's biography, so to immortalize his memory. While he manages to distance himself from the jostling pool of reporters, his biggest challenge is in seeing the great man's reclusive widow (Katharine Hepburn). In short, once the contact is made and the research process undertaken, we see the deceased as through a prism of characters: the eerily effective secretary (Richard Whorf); the down-home philosopher-cab driver (Percy Kilbride); the laconic and somewhat cynical doctor (Frank Craven, who observes of the mass hysteria: \"Some of us held out;\" a pouting cousin (Forrest Tucker), and an embittered caretaker (Howard Da Silva) who had been the hero's captain in World War I. Now, restricted physically by wounds he suffered, he has served the man he once commanded. He seems resentful of the man who saved his life in combat. The effect of unbridled hero worship on an impressioable young mind is captured in the caretaker's son (Darryl Hickman), convinced he is responsible for the death of his idol. His role becomes tedious, but is critical to the underlying psychology of the film.\n\nLike the peeling of an onion, the film reveals layer after layer of the people in the life of a giant, his relations with them, and the passions stirred by his presence ... and his causes. We see that it is wise to temper emotion with information in selecting our icons. While Tracy and Hepburn are quite good in their roles, it is the supporting cast which drives the film. Whorf, Da Silva and Craven are outstanding in key roles. The Bronislau Kaper score and excellent black and white cinematography preserve the quality of the drama and help it through its dated moments. ",

Their first was the delightful George Stevens comedy,\"Woman of the Year\",which was a smash hit at the Box Office. However,many critics consider their second film to be a not bad, but lesser teaming. This is mainly because the characters Tracy and Hepburn play lack the romantic chemistry that was evident in their other films. Also,because of the dark theme of the plot,there is no room for any comical moments. With that said, \"Keeper of the Flame\" is a brilliant mystery-drama with a timely theme:the dangers of false hero-worship. Steven O'Malley(Spencer Tracy)is a\nreporter wanting to write a story on the life of Robert Forrest,a beloved American hero, who has suddenly been killed in a tragic car accident. O'Malley has found it difficult to get an interview with the devastated widow,Christine Forrest(Katharine Hepburn). While waiting for the interview, he encounters peculiar people well-acquainted with the deceased. He meets Forrest's brother-in-law(Forrest Tucker),an embittered man,who seems to despise Forrest, a young boy(Daryll Hickman),who admires Forrest so much,he feels responsible for his death,and Forrest's fussy secretary(Richard Whorf),who isn't what he seems to be. The young boy leads O'Malley to Christine Forrest. O'Malley expects Christine to be well in her middle-age,but he's startled to see she isn't that old. Christine isn't very helpful with the story;she's quite distant when O'Malley asks her certain questions. O'Malley also finds out that Forrest's mother(Margaret Wycherly)is still living. Her identity is near-hidden, so he decides to meet her. Christine claims she's a mentally-disturbed invalid,but O'Malley feels she knows more than she has been given credit for. Meeting these people,O'Malley comes to the startling realization that Robert Forest,a supposed \"American hero\",isn't such a great human being. The acting is vivid and realistic. Katharine Hepburn is excellent in the challenging role of a woman who knows what her husband was really like,but must be \"the keeper of the flame.\" Spencer Tracy is extremely effective as a reporter,who's beliefs have been shattered. The sparkling supporting cast makes the mystery even more intriguing. George Cukor does a terrific job of directing by never having unnecessary scenes and building up the suspense slowly to make the ending have a lasting impression. Cukor's work here foreshadows his work on the psychological dramas,\"Gaslight\"(1944) and \"A Double Life\"(1947). The cinematography is stark and always draws the viewer's attention. The score is appropriately overpowering. The film has some similarities to the overrated,\"Citizen Kane.\"(1941) It's similar in that the main character is a\ndeceased American figure,who's isn't what he seems to be. Also,in both films,the main character lives in a dark,mysterious house. However,the viewer has sympathy for Charles Foster Kane,whereas no one feels sorry for Robert Forrest.

The thing is, coming out so shortly after their landmark Woman Of the year, it isn't properly a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle so much as a George Cukor-Donald Ogden Stewart movie in which they happen to appear.\n\nIt is the story of a newspaperman (Tracy) out to investigate the circumstances behind the death of a much beloved American hero, meets and falls in love with the man's widow (Hepburn)who, along with everyone else whoever knew the man, seems to be harboring some dark secrets as to the true nature of his character. The film owes some obvious debts to Citizen Kane in being the inside scoop on a recently deceased man presumed to be great but who was in actuality something else altogether. In its somber mood, forbidding mansion, enigmatic and generally paranoid aspect, Keeper of the Flame suggests Kane in many regards, but is, to be fair, its own film.\n\nTracy and Hepburn play their roles exceedingly well. The supporting cast is well-chosen, and Percy Kilbride does a nice turn as a cab-driver; while Margaret Wycherly is scarifying as the dead man's mad mother; and a young, Aryan-looking-as-all-getout Forrest Tucker scoots about on a motorcycle like he'd join Hitler's minions at the drop of a hat. Richard Whorf in what at the time must have seemed a 'daring' performance, plays a fussy secretary to the dead hero in a manner which suggests a combination of repressed mania and strong homosexual tendencies. His character is wholly unbelievable but awfully fun to watch.\n\nThe movie has a dark, gothic cast to it, and was obviously filmed on a studio back-lot, but the result is not so much unreality as the suggestion of a fairy tale or a fable strangely consistent with the film's intent, and hence satisfying, making its woods and country roads look at times like a weird and twisted perversion of a Norman Rockwell painting.\n\n\n",

She's reclusive and her servants are dedicated to preserving her sanctity. What's behind this isolation? That in itself is a bothersome question for O'Malley. Something is not ringing right. She was the wife of a popular public figure. Why wouldn't she cooperate? As he digs, he finds he cannot write the story, at first because he does not know enough, and then because he knows too much of the wrong thing and finally because he suspects he does not know what is hidden from him and it is critical.\n\nAnd as he untwists the Gordian knot that is presented to him, he finds there is duplicity and mendacity on every level. But nothing is as simple as it seems. Instead of writing about the icon, he picks the wife.\n\nBut that is not the depth of the film. The depth is revealed as we learn about the Hepburn character and Tracy's response. He moves from someone who can ignore genuine interest in him by a woman, (Audrey Christie), and seek his goal. What develops is first a genuine friendship followed by an admiration that transcends almost any other kind of relationship.\n\nThat is a very complicated situation to convey in the simple straight forward acting method of Tracy's (but he always manages to do what is required of him), and mysterious sophisticated quality that Hepburn always wears like some garment only given once by the gods who give such gifts.\n\nThis is not an easy exercise. Don't get caught in the datedness.

To my eyes, few films are \"unintentionally hilarious\", but there's a bit in the climax where Whorf bounces off the front of a car that's really badly handled and did elicit a slight chuckle.

Revel in the opening third, with its scintillating badinage and Percy Kilbride's hilarious supporting turn, but don't expect that momentum to last.

                "text": "I recently watched \"Keeper\" on TCM. It was one of two Tracy-Hepburn films I had never seen, and I would rank it as the least successful of their films together. Director George Cukor and cinematographer William Daniels give this movie the full-out Gothic treatment, with obvious allusions to both \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Rebecca.\" With its dark, \"Citizen Kane\" lighting, its heavy-handedly sinister atmosphere, its creepy Xanadu/Manderly-like fortress-mansion, its mad mother in the dower house (an interesting variation on \"Jane Eyre\"), its inexplicably hostile and secretive characters (including Richard Whorf as a worshipful male equivalent of Mrs. Danvers), its bizarrely ambiguous performance by Hepburn (is she mad, evil, a murderess, a faithful grieving widow, part of a cover-up conspiracy, a dupe?), it is certainly something to behold. But lacking any subtlety, it's just not that good. Hepburn's first appearance, dressed in white from head to toe and bearing an enormous bouquet of white flowers--more like a bride or vestal virgin than a grieving widow--as she glides toward an idealized portrait of her dead husband, borders on the camp. Only Tracy's consistently understated performance as the reporter and Percy Kilbride's incongruously comic turn as the skeptical Yankee cab driver withstand this ponderous approach. Hepburn's long final monologue, in which she reveals the truth about her dead husband to Tracy, is awkwardly declamatory and politically vague. I would recommend the movie for Hepburn-Tracy completists; just don't expect a very good film. For the record, to me the top Hepburn-Tracy movies are 1)\"Adam's Rib,\" 2) \"Woman of the Year,\" and 3) \"Pat and Mike.\" The first and last of these were also directed by Cukor, but with a decidedly lighter touch.",

The theme, public vrs private personae, was already well know to me, primarily through Joe McCathy's rise and fall, but also from movies like Meet John Doe and Face in the Crowd, while its tone echoed everything from Ace in the Hole to Dragonwhyck: both dark and manic. I even got the Lindbergh allusion because I'd seen numerous newsreels of Lindbergh's speeches, with their hints of racism and fascism, so different from the quintessential American Individualism of Jimmy Stewart's portrayal. No one's mentioned the reference to Alvin York, perhaps because of Gary Cooper's portrayal of a York who consciously rejected what Lindbergh and Forrest embraced.\n\nWhat frightened me was not the specifics of Forrest's 'secrets', the addiction to power, the attraction to fascism, but the way the movie evoked the darkness that resides, hidden and lurking, in all of our souls and how easily that darkness can be unleashed and amplified through the blindness of hero-worship and projection.\n\nHaven't seen it since, not until it was on TMC tonight and I was very curious to see if it was the movie I remembered. For the most part it was and, in ways, was even better. The script, performances and cinematography were flawless, up until the last scene with its intrusion of melodrama and a reverse Deus ex Machina. That scene was totally at odds with rest of the movie, comes close to spoiling the entire movie and I suspect it was edited out of the version I saw as a kid; I certainly didn't remember it.\n\nEven so, it's an great movie technically and well worth a single viewing; depending on taste, perhaps a second or third. Just scrap the ending.\n\nA footnote: Lindbergh, an honest demagogue, and McCarthy, a crooked demagogue, both failed to become kingmakers largely because, while we may idolize 'heroes' and seek 'heroes' to idolize, we don't trust them and, when it comes down to it, we prefer our several hundreds of millions of versions of messy individualism over the comfort and certainty of any ideology.",

                "text": "\"Keeper of the Flame\" is the most fascinating, and least appreciated of the Hepburn-Tracy pairings. To fully understand it, a viewer must look at when it was made. Though not a war movie, it's one of Hollywood's earliest World War II propaganda films, portraying American attitudes just before Pearl Harbor. \n\nIt begins with businessman-statesman-hero, Robert Forrest, dying in a suspicious car crash in September, 1941. Forrest's heroics came in World War I. His unit saw heavy action in the Argonne, and Forrest saved many lives, including that of his commanding officer. We aren't told what he did after the war, but from the comments about him we can assume that his good deeds continued. He founded a nationwide club dedicated to patriotism. His followers idolize him. Tracy plays a reporter just returned from Germany, to an America still fighting internal battles between isolationists and interventionists. O'Malley is an interventionist and loyal Forrest follower. \n\nForrest's story is ending in 1941, but the movie was made the following year, a watershed. The isolationist-interventionist battles raged right up to the morning of Pearl Harbor. FDR-led interventionists fought the heroic Charles Lindbergh and the isolationists. Was Lindbergh Forrest's model? If so, he was no more than a point of departure. Forrest heroics came in battle, not in the sky. This son of servants went on to make a huge fortune and employ a full staff of servants on his vast estate. \n\nUnlike Forrest, Lindbergh was born into the upper middle class. His congressman-father wasn't rich, but the family had servants, and Lindbergh did a short stint in college. Too young for World War I, his only politics were aviation until the worldwide drift toward war in the late '30s. He married a woman about his own age, and began a family. He didn't like fame, and was suspicious of reporters. During the media blitz following his son's kidnapping his suspicions evolved into outright hostility. Nothing we know of Forrest corresponds with any of this. Lindbergh looks to be a model in only two general ways: isolationism and past heroics. \n\nThe 1942 watershed affected all American heroes. Nations always love their heroes, but in the years between the wars, America practiced hero-worship almost as a national pastime. This era of gangsters and corruption also had Sergeant York, Babe Ruth, Elliott Ness and J. Edgar Hoover. Women idolized Amelia Earhart and Eleanor Roosevelt. Even our presidents had to be heroes. Hoover was elected because he'd fed millions of starving children in World War I. When the Depression tarnished him, Americans looked to FDR who'd heroically fought polio.\n\nThis was the world Robert Forrest occupied. It was about to change. World War II altered our ideas about heroes. We built a working man's army filled with depression-bred young people who hated the idea of battle, but were happy to have jobs. On land and sea they did what they must, taking each island and milepost as chores that had to be done. Men fought, killed, and died, the milepost was reached, the island fell, and it was on the next chore. \n\nOur heroes became dirty men who were likely to get dirtier. Their rules were made to bend a little. As our GIs altered our notion of \"hero,\" our support for them never wavered. Now any hero who looked too good drew suspicion. We gained more respect for dirty hands, and less for smooth, clean faces. As we questioned the world, we also traded myth for reality. \n\nThe real life isolationist movement had a huge influence on American thinking right up to December 7, 1941. Up until that morning Charles Lindbergh opposed entering the war with everything he had. After Pearl Harbor isolationism fell into sudden, and nearly total disrepute, taking its hero with it. When Lindbergh tried to volunteer for war service, Roosevelt froze him out. By the time the war ended, many had lost track of \"Lucky Lindy.\" Heroism had morphed into something that was fleeting, unless accompanied by a leavening of sin. We gravitated to anti-heroes,trading Errol Flynn for Humphrey Bogart at the box office. Even FDR was gone, replaced by the far grittier Truman. \n\nThe beginning of this shift is what \"Keeper of the Flame\" is all about. Even in death Robert Forrest is at war with himself. It's the age-old conflict of myth-versus-reality. This plays out in the arc of Hepburn's performance, while Tracy prods her, and himself, toward an elusive truth. \n\nPerhaps the best thing abut this movie is something its original audiences couldn't see: it looks back at an America that might have gone either way, but it also has a fascinating vision of what was to come. It spoke to a new notion of individualism, one that doesn't rely on heroism or wealth. It celebrated people who think for themselves, and look at their leaders critically. \n\nNow we can watch it, and make up our own minds about whether that vision was prescient, wildly off-base, or somewhere in between. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery, but also to all viewers who have an interest in American history.",

For the most part, this gives the film a kind of claustrophobic feeling which actually works in its favor. The rain, the lightning, even the trees, the sky, the bridge on the forest road, the cabin in the woods all seem fake - special effects, miniatures, cycloramas, sets - perfectly lit and shot to suggest the real thing, while also suggesting theatre. Somehow a perfect setting for this drama with its theatrical intensity.\n\nCukor was an odd choice for this material, except that he had directed Hepburn several times before and was probably her favorite director. He brings his usual sincerity to the work, focusing less on polemics as on the emotional toll Forester's life and death has taken on his family and \"fans.\" Again, the artificial sets and lighting, the shooting on back lot and sound stage, work extremely well to create the sense of an isolated, small community who worked and lived in Forrest's shadow, either worshipful, fearful, or skeptical of his intense presence.\n\nWhat's very interesting is the way the man was perceived from afar, vs. close to home. I have often thought of this film when I've seen real-life heroes and wondered exactly what they're really like, what their home life is like, and how they really interact not with the masses but with the actual people around them. While most are not like Forrest, it's still a good idea to keep the lessons this film brings up in mind.\n\nTypically, Cukor does not use the usual MGM stock company for his supporting cast but seems to try to find fresh faces. Audrey Christie appears here in her first film, for example, and Percy Kilbride has one of his first important roles. Richard Whorf and Frank Craven are other faces whose main experience was on the stage at that time.\n\nAn absorbing film with a particularly great performance from Tracy and another amazing one from the young Darryl Hickman.",

                "text": "Influential investigative reporter Spencer Tracy is assigned to tell the story of the life of a late philanthropist whose sudden death shocks the nation. Having been a very prominent humanitarian, the late man left behind a battery of secrets held tightly by his family, which includes his seemingly devoted widow (Katharine Hepburn) and his reclusive mother (Margaret Wycherly). It is difficult at first for Spencer to get through to Katharine, but once he does, she slowly begins to confide in him. In the process of investigating the man's life, Tracy unconsciously begins assisting his survivors in the various aspects of his life. This brings to light the man's true nature and the revelation that his public reputation was not necessarily what his own family knew about him.\n\n\"Keeper of the Flame\" is a sleeper Tracy/Hepburn movie, one of their least famous, but well worth a look. It is also their only drama together other than the western epic \"Sea of Grass\". In many ways, the dead protagonist of \"Keeper of the Flame\" is like the dead \"Rebecca\" of Daphne Du Maurier's novel and the 1940 Hitchcock movie. What everyone around them perceives this person to be is definitely not who they really were, and the revelation of this dead man's true nature comes as a total shock to Tracy who now has to make the choice of how to proceed with his expose on the man's life. Should he reveal the truth and not destroy the legacy the man left behind, or should he keep his mouth shut and keep the legend safe? Also, he has to face the dilemma of Hepburn's role in her husband's demise as well as members of the late man's organization who are desperate to keep their activities quiet. This leaves Hepburn and Tracy in a life-or-death situation that results in an emotional conclusion.\n\nIt goes without saying that Hepburn and Tracy are excellent. In this, their third pairing, they don't share as much a romantic relationship as they do a kinship of understanding. While it is implied that a romance could loom on the horizon, that isn't the focus of their story. Hepburn's widow is obviously a vital woman whose passion for life has been damaged by the truth, and Tracy's reporter is a man filled with integrity that is threatened by what he finds out and how he has to deal with it. Howard da Silva is excellent as a distant relative who at first seems darkly mysterious, but has noble reasons behind his facade. The wonderful Audrey Christie is great as a reporter pal of Tracy's. Wycherly shines in her brief role as the grieving mother, while stage legend Blanche Yurka is sadly wasted as the Mrs. Danvers like housekeeper that keeps her eye on the mother. There are also some fine moments with young Darryl Hickman as Da Silva's son who takes a shine to Tracy and assists him in meeting Hepburn.\n\n\"Keeper of the Flame\" is a film that is still socially relevant today as it warns the viewer to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. What may seem honest up close may not be. As an examination of a dead man's life, it can also be compared to \"Citizen Kane\", if not as engrossing because the man never appears on camera. But viewers will be able to identify people in the public eye who may or may not be guilty of manipulating them into believing that they are someone they are not.",

I think the film has some flaws including the whole mystery aspect that takes too long to reveal.

In 1942, during the early years of World War Two, many industrial and political leaders believed that the implicit order found in fascism was favorable to the implicit confusion of communism, and some of these leaders actively supported fascist governments in Europe and Asia. In large measure, many of the rich supported the contention that the masses needed to be controlled for their own well-being. Christine Forrest's (Katherine Hepburn) husband is a media mogul who believed such--and to an extreme degree. Of course, there were plenty in power in 1942 who could serve as a model for her husband--many of them famous Americans. In essence, the film points out that fascism unchallenged is fascism unleashed. Reporter Steve O'Malley (Spencer Tracy) suspects that Christine's husband's activities were un-American, all under the assumed posture of Americanism. The conflict is therein enjoined. As a film, there are two outstanding performances by Hepburn and Tracy. Most remarkable is the timing between elements of dialogue, particularly the pensive quietude in appropriate scenes. Unfortunately, the acting of the rest of the cast is pretty thin, yet the action is sufficient enough and the ideas profound enough to carry the day.

The revelation about \"Robert Forrest\" was unexpected (to me, anyway); it was nice to see a film show the American belief system is based on ideas and truths rather than mindless patriotism.\n\nThe film should have been better. First, the movie's main \"romantic\" relationship seems to occur too suddenly; certainly, the film's stars were capable of portraying a man and woman falling in love. Also, what did the Forrests' do? It's hinted, once, that \"Christine\" may have been an actress (believable); but, what office did her husband hold (if any)? Of the supporting cast, Margaret Wycherly seems truest, as the dead hero's \"invalid\" mother; a couple of the other players become more grating than effective, after a good first impression.",

                "text": "All the major powers were spending huge sums of money and effort to influence public opinion prior to and during WWII. This film falls into that category.\n\nThis film did not serve as a wake up call for those who opposed the war. We had already entered the war against the Nazi's, and the thinly disguised attack against Lindberg was unjust because once the war started, he threw his name and reputation behind the war effort.\n\nDespite Lindberg's contribution for wining that war, he has always been a target for those who found his constitutional and legal fight against the illegal and unconstitutional actions of President Roosevelt.\n\nFor those who have commented that today's politicians should watch this movie, they should know that President Roosevelt had by 1942 lied numerous times to the public about his intentions to get into the War on the side of Great Britan. Lindberg's political movement was constitutional and legal. Only his judgment should be questioned.\n\nHistory has vindicated Roosevelt's lies and illegal acts against neutrality, and his personal motive to fight with he Allies. But what if the Allies had lost, or the War dragged on for over a decade? Depending on your politics, propaganda is good or bad. Was Washington a traitor or hero. It all depends on who is making that judgment.\n\nThis site is dedicated to art and film as an art form. Unfortunately, some of the films made at this time are propaganda, and a target for condemnation for the corruption of true art.\n\nArt that is timeless, because it touches on universal truths while temporary fashions come and go.\n\nThis film fails because it has an unrealistic plot line, situations that are unbelievable and younger viewers with a weak knowledge of history would fail to understand what the plot attempts to portray.\n\nThe story begins by showing a speeding car in a hard rain, and then crashing. There is a universal mourning of the American public. but five minutes into the film which expects us to believe that this great man, is reckless since he speeds in tremendous storm and doesn't have the sense to slow down approaching a flimsy wooden bridge. But Forrest was a man who has the resources, or had enough influence to build a steel and/or concrete bridge. Key to the plot is that Hepburn, who plays Forrest's young wife, knows the bridge has collapsed and he will be killed. It also requires us to accept that she knows Forrest would be killed. But hasn't everyone heard that \"it was a miracle that he/she survived the accident?\" The writer's must give Hepburn's character the courage to kill Forrest, without actually killing him. The speeding, the collapse of the bridge,and certain death must be accepted by the viewer to allow Hepburn's canonization at the end of the film. Never mentioned is the possibility that some innocent person may get killed. That question is never asked by the character played by Tracey, who goes from hero worshiper discoverer of the REAL Forrester. In the space of several days, he unravels what it took Hepburn years of married life to determine. We must suffer with her anguish as she determines that she must kill her husband, but save his public reputation. Of Course Tracey talks her out of such a scheme-for the good of the country. The youth of the country may be lead to believe that Stalin never existed, or that his ideas of conquest were much different than Hitler. Though Stalin's crimes against humanity were at least as bad as Hitler's, he had the better fortune to have switched sides and were now one of our allies in 1942.\n\nRichard Whorf plays Forrest's creepy assistant. First he recommends that Hepburn speak to Tracey-is not the sort of journalist who can be put off. So what does that say about the others? There all dopes, or Hepburn should talk to the smartest one? Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nOf course Tracey discovers everything, and Whorf's character plots to kill Tracey and Hepburn in the ancient fort, and destroy evidence at the same time. Alledgedly there is no comedy in this film, but I laughed at the idea of starting a fire with gasoline, expecting to kill Tracey and Hepburn and all the evidence. So you start a fire and shoot Hepburn? Ask any fireman about destroying files or papers, especially when a structure is primarily stone.\n\nWhat purpose is served by shooting Hepburn other than giving her a death scene? Is it to avoid the unanswered question of putting innocent people at risk? I recently saw this film on TCM and the moderator stated that Louis Mayer stomped out of the theater because the film attacked his friend William Randolph Hearst. That statement is not correct. Hearst was the real person fictionalized in Citizen Kane. Hearst was never a beloved hero like the man who flew the Atlantic and earned the hearts of his fellow Americans, who then suffered through the kidnapping of his child. Lindberg, not Hearst, became one of the leaders of a political movement that advocated strict neutrality.\n\nWhatever faults Lindberg had about his failure to see Hitler for what he was, there are many more who did not see Stalin for what he was.\n\nOnce the war started, Lindberg threw himself and his tremendous prestige into the war effort. But some never forgave his opposition to the illegal violations against neutrality. Political opposition to war is a constitutional right, regardless of the \"justice\" of the war.",

                "text": "This film is, alas, pretty slow going. Spencer Tracy is a writer who is authorized by Katherine Hepburn to do a biography of her recently deceased husband, an American hero. Everybody idolizes Robert Forrest, who died in a car crash. He was everything America stood for in the rather hard days of 1942.\n\nRight? Certainly not. Tracy discovers that Forrest over the years had become drunk with power (or the lack of it) and was a typical dirty Commie rat -- I mean dirty Nazi rat. Well, not that it matters much. If Forrest was a closet Fascist it's only because the year was 1942 instead of ten years later. We don't find out about Forrest's real ambitions until the big reveal by Hepburn at the end of the film, and it's more or less thrown out to the audience. (\"Here's a list of the men who were to become his Storm Troopers.\") As far as the plot goes, his villainy was generic. If this had been written by Budd Schulberg, Forrest might have been a labor racketeer. If it had been written by Tennessee Williams, Forrest might have been gay.\n\nThe bulk of the film is taken up with Tracy's gradual uncovering of the truth. But, man, it's slow. We never DO find out just what Forrest did for a living, although he's terribly rich. It's an hour into the movie before Tracy realizes that all might not be what it seems. There are a lot of irrelevant characters and conversations, some red herrings, not badly acted but not contributing much to the depth of the story either. Nor are the ancillary characters interesting in themselves. The musical score is uninspired and the photography heavily influenced by noir techniques -- plenty of silhouettes passing back and forth before the camera. It's all pretty sluggish.\n\nCompare it with the structure of \"Citizen Kane.\" In Kane we have a reporter interviewing multiple characters, each giving slightly different versions of Kane's development from young man into old man, from fighter for the underprivileged to monarch of all he surveys. We know the informants and we can watch Kane's ambitions evolve. It's everything that \"Keeper of the Flame\" is not.\n\nHepburn bursts out with The Truth in a ten-minute spiel near the end. I kept remembering that she was on the receiving end of a similar tale near the end of a Tennessee Williams script, with Elizabeth Taylor delivering a nearly hysterical monologue about Hepburn's son being eaten by a horde of young men he'd sodomized, in \"Suddenly, Last Summer\".\n\nIt's hard to imagine that this was an imitation of \"Citizen Kane\", as someone has suggested. \"Kane\" almost torpedoed RKO and it's doubtful that MGM would want that kind of attention. More likely, maybe, that an old script for a murder mystery was dusted off and someone substituted a reporter for the policeman, and a fascist for the murderer. That's about what it amounts to, unfortunately, Grade B fodder with plenty of melanine.",

By that time, viewers will be wondering when this long-winded scenario will end.\n\nIt's almost an early film noir in its presentation--very low-key lighting full of shadows as dark as the mystery behind the man's existence. Was he trying to ruin America with his fascism? Was he clearly a man who deserved death as a punishment for his sins? Very unusual for an MGM film of this period to soak up so much noir atmosphere and, more than that, to serve as a vehicle for the talents of Hepburn and Tracy. Some of it works, but much of it is tedious in the telling.\n\nA good cast gives it what it deserves, no more, no less, including FORREST TUCKER, MARGARET WYCHERLY and DARRYL HICKMAN (in another one of his tiresome childhood roles).

Even Tracy stutters and sputters in a vain attempt to bring Stewart's agit-prop slop to life. Stewart was a patrician communist who probably got his mission to smear the great patriot Charles Lindbergh and the noble isolationist movement straight from Moscow. While Stewart and his dupe colleagues made this film in Hollywood comfort, Charles Lindbergh was actively fighting Fascism by training American pilots and developing aircraft. He volunteered for active fighter pilot service but FDR would not let him serve knowing that Lindbergh would have been an Ace. However, friends helped Lindbergh fly combat missions against Japan. Now, how many of those did Stewart, Cukor and Tracy fly? Don't believe the Hollywood lies about Charles Lindbergh. They are as phony as those about HUAC and the \"sainted\" Hollywood 10.",

            "American military leader and war hero Robert Forrester, universally beloved and respected within the country and thus touted as Presidential material, has just died in a freak car accident on his sprawling estate, where, during an unexpected rainstorm, the car he was driving plunged over a ravine as he didn't notice the washed-out bridge. While the nation mourns, the national reporters descend on his small hometown to write the story of the incident. One reporter who won't is renowned Steven O'Malley, who wants instead to write an in-depth piece on the man to preserve his status within the public consciousness. Although happy to use official documents and records, O'Malley wants most specifically to speak to his wife, Christine Forrester, which may be a difficult task as she has refused to grant any interviews as a very private person. O'Malley is able to meet with Christine in person, and although she is reluctant to oblige his request at first, she is convinced by Robert's aide, Clive Kerndon, to cooperate with him so as to control the agenda. As O'Malley begins his research, he begins to think that Christine and others around her are hiding something about Robert and/or his death. O'Malley is determined to discover the truth, which he believes may have something to do with: Robert's mother, afflicted with dementia and hidden away in a big isolated house on the estate; Christine's cousin, Geoffrey Midford, who does not hide his disdain for Robert; and/or Jason Rickards, one of Robert's servants, or one of Jason's children, Jason who was once Robert's superior in the military before he was permanently injured in battle and saved by Robert in the process."

                "text": "A couple of years ago I was at a library near where I work and was dismayed to find that the video selection included only one Buster Keaton movie, Sidewalks of New York, an abysmal feature he made for MGM in the early talkie days. Anyone who had never seen Buster's great silent comedies and watched this film instead would get a badly distorted idea of his abilities, and might never want to give him another chance. Now, to add to the frustration, I find that the library down the street from where I live has just acquired its first Keaton material on DVD: a two-disc set of short comedies he made for Columbia Pictures in the late 1930s and early '40s, comedies which, in my opinion, represent the nadir of Buster's entire career. Even the weakest sound features he made at MGM have their moments here and there, and several of the two-reel shorts he appeared in at Educational Pictures in the mid-'30s are surprisingly enjoyable, but the Columbia series is the pits. Jules White, who directed most of them, favored a fast-loud-and-violent approach to film-making, and to say that this is contrary to the spirit of Keaton's best work is putting the matter politely. Wit is absent from these films, and all a viewer can do is feel sorry for the star as he valiantly attempts to lend these bargain basement comedies a touch of class.\n\nI single out The Taming of the Snood for comment because it may well be the worst of the bunch. The closest this short gets to humor is in the opening sequence, when Buster, who runs a hat shop, tries to lure a skeptical lady customer into making a purchase by modeling several goofy new creations. The problem with this scene is obvious: any comedian can get laughs by putting on silly hats. This sort of shtick is for second-stringers like El Brendel or Hugh Herbert, not Buster Keaton. (You don't even need a professional: your Uncle Bob can get a laugh with a funny hat.) Furthermore, fans of his best work will only be reminded of the great hat shop sequence in his silent feature Steamboat Bill, Jr., where the laughs were inspired not by the hats themselves but rather through a carefully developed situation and the star's inspired performance.\n\nIn any event, Buster is soon plunged into a half-hearted plot concerning crooks and ill-gotten gain. A stolen jewel is hidden in the band of his famous pork-pie hat, and then we're whisked away to an apartment building where Buster must make a delivery. It is here that he encounters a low-comedy maid played by Elsie Ames, and the picture goes straight down the tubes. Elsie Ames is, bar none, the worst comic I've ever seen. She mugs, she rolls her eyes, she assumes \"funny\" voices and seems to think she's the cutest thing going. This would be acceptable in a grade school pageant where the performers are, say, 7 years old, but in an adult these outrageously hammy antics are deeply irritating. If Ames had given a performance like this at Keystone back in 1913 director Mack Sennett would have stopped the camera and told her to tone it down a little, but apparently Jules White egged her on. Meanwhile, all Buster can do try to maintain his dignity while this freak makes a fool of herself. There is a brief attempt to re-enact The Three Keatons' table routine from Buster's vaudeville childhood, but Elsie ruins it with her loud-mouthed buffoonery. The final scenes involve a pet parrot who gets the jewel attached to his leg, flies out the window, and nestles on a flagpole. Buster, working in front of a depressingly obvious rear-projection screen, climbs out onto the ledge and engages in some bogus \"thrill\" comedy while Ames continues to make a nuisance of herself right down to the final fade-out. At that point I imagine Buster heaved a sigh of relief and hustled off to the Bursar's Office to collect his paycheck.\n\nAll I can add is that if you're browsing the shelves of your local library and see this collection of Keaton's Columbia output, do yourself a favor: skip it, and seek out his silent work instead. When Buster left Columbia in 1941 he was quoted as saying that he \"couldn't stomach turning out even one more crummy two-reeler.\" If you happen to see The Taming of the Snood you'll find out just what he meant.",

                "text": "I'm more indulgent towards this late Buster Keaton Columbia short than the other two reviewers on the IMDb. There's nothing fancy about this two reeler, it's basically three set-pieces -- in a hat shop, taming the drunken maid, and falling off the building -- around a plot to keep a stolen jewel from the police. It's not the strongest of Keaton's late shorts for Columbia, but it's formlessness allows Buster to infuse the short with a lot of inventive (and probably largely invented on the spot) physical comedy.\n\nThe hat shop scene in probably the weakest; the laughs are expected to come mainly from the funny prop hats the Buster shows off, but this only goes so far. The biggest laugh here comes from Buster's attempt to use a water basin as a mirror and hold it up his customer, and then to use a MOP to clean up someone wet.\n\nThe scene with the accidentally drunk maid is purely Keaton mining comedy from nothing but a table and a prostrate actress, and it works well despite the fact that Keaton's support, actress Elsie Ames, is way over the top and not too funny. This sequence and the next are played with hardly any dialogue, but I got a laugh purely out of the way Buster delivers the line \"She's out... I hope.\" I will still argue with anyone who says he couldn't speak well.\n\nThe third act, after Buster has accidentally fallen out the window, is a curious echo of many 20s comedy involving Harold Lloyd and then many other comics hanging off buildings. Here it's very clear that back projection is being used rather than an actual high building, but it's so well played by the star, who seems to have influenced the material to fit the particular set-up of this film, that I don't mind.\n\nThis short may be clearly cheap and largely made up on the spot, but that's a large part of what makes it so charming and allows Buster the latitude create comedy out of the materials at hand.",

And yet others have found what they perceive to be hidden diamonds in the manure, even going as far as to defend the infamous Elsie Ames. As for my own opinion, I am much more mixed, but all in all Snood is not that bad. Dumb and unoriginal in every way, but not unholy in its mediocrity.\n\nGoing in, we all knew Buster Keaton was not going to be utilized. His originality, talent, and dry humor are tossed aside, leaving him to only use his physical gifts for the crudest kind of slapstick possible. Still, he comes off as charming in his character's gullible way, though having him scream for help during the \"thrill\" scenes seemed so, so wrong. (Cinematic rule #293: Buster Keaton never screams or cries for help. EVER. He can show fear or even run away from danger, but he never asks people for help, just as he never asks the audience for pity.) One of the reviewers on here pressed for folks to give Elsie Ames a break. I will give Ames this: she is a fantastic physical comedienne. Her rubbery limbs and ability to take nasty dives and falls astonished me, and gave me a new respect for her. However, her character's shrillness and \"funny\" voices are the epitome of trying too hard to be funny. But then again, maybe she was trying her best to make the squalid dialogue more interesting. Doesn't work, but I won't blame her too much for that. Dorothy Appleby is wasted in a minor part as a gun-toting jewel thief; I much prefer her to Ames and think she and Keaton had better comic chemistry.\n\nThe two big set-pieces of this short are the drunk maid routine, which has Buster and Ames doing some impressive falls, and a cheaper recreation of the climax of Harold Lloyd's Safety Last (1923). In case you haven't seen Safety Last (in which case you totally should, it's a classic), the climax has Harold climbing up the side of a building, coming close to falling to his death in ways both funny and horrific. It's nail-biting, one of the most memorable scenes in all cinema, culminating with Harold hanging off a clock face. A similar thing happens in Snood, with Buster forced to grab the MacGuffin by climbing up the building facade. It looks quite fake, even by 1940s standards, and the gags are even cheaper. Very sad.\n\nSo while I would not claim Snood is a lost gem, it is not the nadir of Keaton's time at Columbia. The drunk maid stuff is entertaining (despite Ames's shrill character) and luckily that's the majority of the film's fifteen minute run time.",

In a way, her over-the-top and obnoxious performance serves as a foil to the understated Keaton. I think that it actually works in \"Snood\", with Buster treating Elsie as a piece of the world run amok that he has to cope with. And physically she was capable of keeping up with him, something she deserves full credit for.\n\n\"The Taming of the Snood\" was supposed to center around Keaton's failing hat shop, but Keaton and Ames improvised so much in the drunken maid scene that something else had to go. What went was the hat shop plot, which got shortened into a brief vignette and enough of a setup to explain why Buster ended up in the apartment with the jewel thief.\n\nIt's once Buster is in the apartment with Elise that the reins are handed over. With nimble dancer Elsie and the traditional Three Keatons prop of a nice, sturdy table, Buster recreates for us on screen much of what must have been his bread-and-butter during his vaudeville years. Here is our nugget of pure Keaton gold.\n\nThough the film is silly and full of absurd impossibilities (such as the way Keaton falls out a window, and keeps getting dropped lower and lower, only to fall one more time and somehow end up back in the original apartment), the director allowed Keaton some opportunities to really be a Keaton character -- the plucky, stoic little man who manages to triumph even though the world is spinning out of control around him.",

It's a sad set of films Keaton did later in his career with Columbia Pictures and the films bore more resemblance to Three Stooges films than Keaton's classic silents. Of the 10, eight were directed by Jules White--a man who had absolutely no understanding or appreciation of Keaton's subtle humor. As a lady said in the documentary included with the set (\"Buster Keaton: From Silents to Shorts\"), White's idea of funny was dropping anvils on people's heads! His totally unsubtle and dopey humor made all the films he directed with Keaton a chore to watch at times--especially with the silly Stooge sound effects and timing. In addition, this film also co-starred Keaton with Elsie Ames--a completely obnoxious and untalented lady in every film she did with Keaton. Her overly exaggerated facial expressions, mannerisms and yelling made Patsy Kelly look subtle in her shorts for Hal Roach!! So already from the start, Keaton had two major disadvantages in the film, so you certainly cannot expect magic.\n\nIn this film, a thief places a stolen ring inside Buster's hat. After that, he goes to the home where Elsie Ames is the maid and the film degenerates into a slapstick nightmare thanks to the loud and obnoxious and totally untalented Ames. She should have been ashamed for her performance--one that the Stooges themselves would have complained about because of its low humor!! This might just be the worst short of the series of ten.

This film - along with the other wartime shorts on the DVD that contains it - stems from that impulse.\n\nOn one level, the film is meant to educate general audience in the scenarios of the history of flight, aerial combat and the (then) global crisis regarding the Allies vs. the Axis powers.\n\nIt does its job, entertaining when possible, affirming destruction and American/Allied dominance at critical points.\n\nDuring my most recent viewing of it, I found that it almost seemed to make the case for nuclear warfare. Not outright, mind you, but through its continued emphasis of how Allied airstrikes, because of their remote points of origin, can/could not possibly inflict enough damage to Axis supply lines to shut them down. The film and its military authority Major Seversky propose that long range bombers are the answer - after which a presumably innovative animated version of just such a long range bomber is shown on screen: its long, clumsy-looking, with several large gunwales pointing out all over the plane's body. After seeing that, i could only surmise that military officials of the 1940s saw the folly in trying to build bigger and better airships to do in the Axis. Instead, per the film's rhetoric, the more logical solution seems/seemed to be: \"Forget about trying to send a volley of superplanes; instead, send only one plane - but design its cargo to deliver Armageddon!\"",

De Seversky makes a valid point that the war should be fought with an enlarged military air force as opposed to naval and land based tactics.   He is made to be very informative and enjoyable to watch against the animated maps and diagrams created by Disney's finest animators.\n\nEerily, there is a link to the 9/11 happening in the idea de Seversky expresses that air power removes the lines between civilians and soldiers and puts the lives of any of us at risk.

De Seversky argued that we should use bombers to attack Axis factories, farms, lines of transportation and resources. Basically, he argued that America and England should begin killing civilians by the tens of millions. And it's a Disney film.\n\nAfter a brief homage to General Billy Mitchell, the first major animated sequence of the film you've probably seen: \"History of Aviation.\" It starts with the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, and documents the beginning of flight. It then moves on to the formation of the American Air Corps in 1908, early achievements in flight. It shows how aircraft were used in World War I, with the first surveillance planes, the first fighters and the first bombers.\n\nThe film moves on to give a history of World War II up to that point, but there are several factual errors, including a sequence where the German Army uses air cover and tanks to break the Maginot Line. In reality, Germany simply invaded France through Belgium. It shows that the invasion of Crete was a great victory for Germany, while it was actually a disaster that nearly failed.\n\nThe film then goes on to describe America's role in the war, describing America as the \"Arsenal of Democracy.\" It argues that since American supply lines are thousands and thousands of miles long and German/Japanese supply lines are very short, Japan and Germany have a decided advantage over us. The solution? Stop attacking Hitler's tanks and soldiers, and begin attacking the factories, farms, workers and farmers which build those tanks and feed those soldiers.\n\nThe film has a decidedly unsettling tone about it. It begins as a typical Walt Disney cartoon documentary, light-hearted and funny, but it ends describing some of the most disturbing tactics of modern combat, such as blowing up dams to flood the enemy, and employing bombs that will cause earthquakes, perhaps a metaphor for nuclear weapons. It's definitely not for children.\n\nThe version found on The Disney Treasures set \"On the Front Lines\" is only 65 minutes long, and doesn't have the scene that argues that America is the greatest nation for aviators by insulting every nation in Europe, including our allies, France and Britain.",

I loved it. In the decades since, I'd always clearly remembered the comical shot of an early WWI fighter plane pilot using a machine gun before the technology to synchronize machine guns with propellers had been developed.\n\nWhen I became interested in Disney animation several years ago, I hoped to find a copy of that one. But I learned that it had never been released on any videotape or videodisc format, and that my only glimmer of hope of ever seeing it again was to buy a 16mm film projector and find an old 16mm print, and probably pay a lot for it. More than any other, this title had me seriously thinking about doing that.\n\nIt's been some time since I've kept up with new DVD releases. I was shopping at Costco today and stumbled across some of Disney's \"Treasures Limited Edition\" tins. I already had some of those, but I noticed that these were titles I hadn't seen before. I tossed the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck titles into my cart, passed on one that was about Tomorrow Land, and dug through to make sure I hadn't missed any. I could hardly believe my eyes when I picked up one that said \"On the Front Lines\" and \"The War Years\". My first thought was to wonder if it included that aviation history I had seen in 1978. I turned it over and yes, it said it included not only the aviation history part I had seen then, but the entire film!\n\nSomewhat in a daze, I went straight to the checkout line, then straight home, then straight to the DVD player. Even my wife watched it with me, I guess because she could see how excited I was about it.\n\n\nI loved it in 1978 on 16mm, and I loved it again in 2004 on DVD. It's at once an interesting history, attractive animation, and fun entertainment. I\nwas also interested to see the realism in animation of planes I had learned about over the years.\n\nThe live action part was also very interesting and well worth watching, if a\nlittle on the tedious side at times, especially for my wife. It's certainly very interesting to consider how this movie may have changed the course of the war, or more precisely, this movie may have brought enough attention to the book that inspired it, and to that book's brilliant and prophetic author, to have changed the course of the war.\n\nIt was so interesting, I plan to watch it again soon -- though my wife probably won't.\n\nI'm struggling to articulate how it feels to suddenly stumble across this title on a very well-made DVD, after not seeing it at all for 26 years and having more or less given up any serious hope of ever seeing it again. It's still almost a little hard to believe.\n\nWhen I looked up this DVD title on the web, I was a little startled to find that I had bought it on the very day it was released! (May 18th, 2004)\n\nIt looks like Disney has let the earlier \"Treasures Limited Edition\" tins go out of print, and undoubtedly they will do the same with \"On the Front Lines\". If you have any interest at all in aviation history, and/or in WWII, and/or in rare Disney animation gems, then \"On the Front Lines\" is a must-have, just for Victory Through Air Power. (I haven't even watched most of the shorts on the DVD yet.)\n\n",

See for yourself what a mix of emotions this film causes in you. To see that the same studio which produced Snow White and Bambi could so quickly and effectively recalibrate their drawing tables for War is spooky and makes you wonder what other messages lie hidden in the vast Disney canon.",

The Disney crew really did a terrific job with the animation as it's up to their usual high standards.

                "text": "It's hard to endorse a film about a war involving such blood, sacrifice, and hatred when it comes to us in the form of a cartoon. Elmer Fudd is the proper subject of a cartoon, and Mickey Mouse, and The Flintstones.\n\nYet this is probably the most famous cartoon to come out of World War II, made by the Disney people in a style, about a subject, far different from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" There is no newsreel footage at all, and virtually no still photographs. The whole thing is a cartoon. And the cartoons are both informative and reasonably accurate. A Stuka looks like a Stuka, not like a generic \"airplane.\" Even a lesser known airplane like the Japanese G-4 \"Betty\" looks like what it's supposed to be.\n\nAnd our chief source of information, aside from Art Baker's narration, is Alexander P. de Seversky, aviation expert, industrialist, and military strategist. It was his company, Republic, that gave us the P-47 Thunderolt.\n\nHere, the live interludes, are lectures from Seversky outlining his thesis in his Russian accent, which goes something like, \"Trow avay da bettleships and built airoplens instead.\" He doesn't argue that air power is an important means of winning the war. To him, it seems to be the ONLY way. His presentation is very simple and clear but in case you don't get his point, the cartoons spell it out for you in lurid color. A chimpanzee would get it.\n\nOf course this was released in 1943, a year during which the major turning points of the war began -- new Allied anti-submarine defenses, Stalingrad, the fall of Italy, and a tremendous outpouring of American military equipment. Seversky's logic points up the importance of air power but, without a crystal ball and without access to classified information, he made claims that weren't true.\n\nJust a few examples, because he doesn't make that many mistakes. The British and French troops weren't successfully evacuated from Dunkirk because the RAF ruled the skies. The Nazis weren't building ever bigger and more potent submarines. The RAF and USAAF attacks on factories were good at tearing up cities but not at destroying the ability to produce weapons or at breaking the will of the victims. He proudly describes the terrific hammering of a city like K\u00f6ln without mentioning that our own losses in attacks like these were so appalling that they needed to be temporarily suspended. The guy is full of belief and passion, though, so much so that one wouldn't want to argue with him.\n\nHe's certainly right about one thing. The longer your supply lines, the less secure your position. It was illustrated in the battles between Rommel and the British in North Africa. Each army would drive the other back until its supplies were unsteady, then they in turn would be driven back to their source. In 1943, Japan's empire covered a vast amount of territory. Seversky examines each possible approach to reaching Japan and rules all of them out. Island hopping? Nope. Too many islands to conquer one by one. Meanwhile Japan would be siphoning off the necessary materials of war from its own conquered territory.\n\nBut it was that approach that we finally used successfully, once we realized that we could skip many of the stronghold and leave them to \"wither on the vine.\" The two B-29s that dropped the big ones and ended the war took off from Tinian Island, one of the Ryuku chain, that we had reached by island hopping. And the Japanese never did continue siphoning off enough war materials because our own submarines (that is, the USN, not the USAAF) made the sea routs impassable to shipping.\n\nI don't mean to be too harsh on Seversky. It's certainly no fault of his that he didn't predict thermonuclear bombs and jet engines. Perhaps his presentation was flawed but his reasoning sound. In 1943, even if you knew about our losses over France, Germany, and Romania, would it have been wise to publicize them? The film is almost like a peek into the past and almost renders our current problems minuscule.",

However, it was also quite a prescient and important one and deserves to be seen by anyone interested in the history of the studio or historically interested in acts of war.\n\nBased on the book by Alexander de Seversky, the film does have a few animated sequences (and quickly illustrates numerous ideas and potential scenarios) but it's predominantly an interesting talk given by the author of the book on his theories and how the rules of the battlefield have been changing since the development of flying machines. Looking at strategies and the lessons from history, it's hard to argue with a lot of what he says.\n\nAs is usually the case, a number of writers and directors worked together to create the final product. As you would expect, it's not half as entertaining as many of the other Disney outings from the 1940s but it makes up for that with such a high curiosity factor that it remains enjoyable from start to finish (about 70 minutes max).\n\nRKO may have refused to carry the movie, seeing no profit in it, but we can be glad that Disney then went to United Artists to get the film a theatrical release. It was never going to be a moneymaker but it certainly seems to have impressed important people of the time, most notably Winston Churchill who then urged Franklin D. Roosevelt to watch the film, which led to Roosevelt finally committing to a full air campaign against Germany.\n\nWhich means that maybe, just maybe, this oft-overlooked Disney film helped the right people to win WWII.

                "text": "\"Victory Through Air Power\" (1943) is one of Disney's direct propaganda films for the U.S. State Department reiterating the 1942 book of the same name. It bounces between live-action segments, with briefing-style professed theories on the abstract value of air superiority, and segments with animated diagrams and maps supporting its theories. In combination with the Disney movie, the book's author presented the idea of separating air units away from the U.S. Army and into their own department. Soonafter, the U.S. Government formed the Air Force.\n\nThis film is just one of the reminders that Walt Disney exists elsewhere from his current stature as a \"children's movie producer.\" He was also a McCarthyist in favor of the blacklist during the Congressional witch hunts from the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC). To the day I write this, his company still censors Disney's Beethoven segment of \"Fantasia\" (1940) in VHS and DVD video releases due to a racial comment. Also, the only movie the company has not released of his original classics is \"Song of the South,\" a movie about a little white boy who encounters a group of black storytellers. This writer is curious how, in the time of \"Amos and Andy,\" Disney came up with an idea for a little black mouse in work overalls named \"Mickey\" which he voiced.

In 1941 Elliott (generally regarded as the original \"Wild Bill Hickok\") got to play both the grandson of Daniel Boone and the \"Son of Davy Crockett. These Columbia features look very good for their time, in some ways better and more authentic that similar stuff made on higher budgets by other studios in the 1950's. \n\nIn this story Wild Bill Boone (Elliott) stumbles on a town with a scheming town boss Leach Kilgrain (Ray Bennett) and a crooked Mayor (Walter Soderling). They have raised taxes to levels most ranchers cannot pay and plan to acquire the properties at a bargain when they are sold for overdue taxes. Ellen Brandon (Betty Miles), the daughter of a local rancher, has accidentally killed the tax collector just before Bill's arrival. He accepts an offer to assume the now vacant position, believing it a good way to gather the evidence needed to expose the scheme. \n\nBill's plan is to mark some of the town's tax money and see if it is used to purchase land at the tax sale, thereby tying Kilgrain to the Mayor. Unfortunately Ellen thinks he is in league with the bad guys and her impulsive actions derail his plan. So things get a little more complicated before they finally get sorted out.\n\n\"The Return of Daniel Boone\" transcends this rather ordinary plot by introducing a very original back-story involving Bill's long-time bumbling sidekick Cannonball Taylor (Dub Taylor). Cannonball is the strangely reluctant recipient of the attentions of identical twin sisters Melinda and Matilda (played by twin sisters Verda and Verna Rodik). This becomes even more comical because Cannonball thinks they are the same girl. Since the Rodik girls are arguably the hottest actresses you will ever find in this type of western (plus they do some nice singing), and Dub Taylor is anything but leading man material; his ability to resist their charms until almost the end seems highly unlikely.\n\nThen again, what do I know?

The dialogue is studded with clich\u00e9s, the plot is familiar and little attempt is made to work up any sense of mystery or suspense. In fact, the movie is thoroughly routine in all departments. Some musical interludes by Smith Ballew at a long after-the-climax wedding breakfast sequence fail to rally an audience's interest. The songs are likewise unmemorable and the background music is a rehash of that recorded in previous Brown westerns. Production credits can be classed as no more than adequate. Likewise, production values rate no more than fair.",

Aside from Shirley Temple, no other woman has managed to do it more than 3 years in a row.

There's virtually no story and the whole thing seems a series of competition sequences in the water. Either the crew practices or competes! Intercut in-between are a few sequences where the leading man, the boring John Hartley, fights with his powerful dad or is seen with Betty Grable.\n\nNow, Betty Grable! Though top-billed, she's not seen very often. She doesn't sing or dance at all and is given absolutely no chance to act or stand out. A SHAME! She's very beautiful as always but one notices the darker hair. For those who love her, don't have too many expectations because she's not even decorative in this film. The director, Nick Grinde, gives her no chance AT ALL! Peter Hayes is there, at least! In a not very (supposedly) sympathetic role, he steals the film the moment he appears. He's full of the energy and the talent John Hartley lacks so much. He was a very charismatic actor and it's a shame we haven't seen him more often.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't see much of the very handsome Buster Crabbe either. HE is the one that should have been the leading man and Betty Grable's partner. As the coach, he has the authority required and is effective, but his part is not very important. One wishes he'd take his shirt off as always in his films to display that superb torso and compete with the boys in order to win that competition but he doesn't. Again, A SHAME! Besides that, it's interesting to see a bit of Jackie Coogan, the former child star (see genius Charlie Chaplin's movies of the 20's!) and first husband of Betty Grable. He gives his best shot but, as it's the case for Betty Grable, he's not given any chance to show-off his talent.\n\nAll in all, try to see this film if you can but don't expect to much.",

The Dean is played by Thurston Hall who delivers who usual solid performance. John Hartley stars as the Dean's son who just happens to be a star rower. Much of the film follows the students as they try and get the rowing program back in the water.\n\nDonald O'Connor is also billed but has a minor role as young jockey. He provides a key tip that allows the student to back his horse and raise some money for the rowing team. Jackie Coogan, also billed, only has a couple lines, is 25 years old and looks 35, which strains credibility as his is suppose to be a student. This marks an interesting point in the movie itself. That being that the older kids are quite horrible to the freshmen, which causes a couple of cringes because some of the \"kids\" look 35.\n\nThe finale has Middleton College up against a rival in a big rowing challenge. Middleton wins; the Dean sees the error of his academics only attitude; and Fry comes through by giving a little back to the student body. A very competent well made Paramount B'.",

Mrs Pym and Shott investigate the cases of two women who have died shortly after making bequests to a spiritualist group. The scenes shot at their meetings are unusually creepy for a British film of this period. Considering Morland was an experienced writer of detective fiction, the plot here is barmy. Mrs Pym uncovers clues that in reality would be impossible to detect and eventually deduces murder by vacuum cleaner, surely unique in literary and film history. But considering this was a quota quickie shot by an independent at the tiny Highbury Studios in North London (the single location is the street outside), the production values, performances and pace aren't bad. Incredible by today's standards is the attitude to women. The all-male police force believe that the department will collapse because a woman has been co-opted; and even Mrs Pym admits that the reason she's been assigned to the case is that only a woman could appear \"goofy\" enough to infiltrate a spiritualist society. Nevertheless there's an unusually prominent disclaimer in the main titles (see Crazy Credits) and it's possible that it was an afterthought because of the revival of interest in spiritualism during the War.",

At times, it feels almost like a proto-Woody Allen film, talky and intellectual and neutotic in a very Woody-like sort of way.  And then there were a couple of moments when I thought of 60s-style European auteur cinema, especially Fellini.  And then there are moments of standard Hollywood-style screwball comedy.  And then there was that utterly bizarre and hilarious dream sequence with the Dali-esque set design--I was reminded of that dream sequence from Hitchcock's Spellbound.\n\n\nThree different writers are credited with the screenplay, and inconsistency in writing styles seems glaringly apparent as the film plays out.  Subtle and witty at times, the writing becomes painfully clumsy and forced at others, especially when it goes for a broader style of comedy or when it tries to advance the plot.\n\nI don't know the story behind the making of this film, but it feels very tampered-with, like maybe it started with  a clever and original screenplay, but the studio execs didn't trust it and so they hired a couple of hack writers to come in and dumb it down for the masses.  It feels like it ALMOST could have been something of a classic.  It's still very worth watching, though.  The storyline is interesting and, in a way, seems about 30 years ahead of its time.  I'd be particularly interested to hear a feminist scholar's take on the film.\n\nDo women really prefer a caveman to an intellectual, a protector to a partner?

The story concerns a college professor, John Hathaway (Ameche) who has written a very intellectual book on jealousy and travels with his wife (Russell) to meet his publisher Elliot (Heflin) and editor Nellie (Francis). Elliot likes to play around, and Nellie is in love with him. Julie keeps trying to make her husband jealous, not by deed but by hints that a certain man likes her, for instance, and is he worried - thinking that a jealous outburst would be proof of his love. However, he trusts her unreservedly and never suspects her of anything. He's especially sure that despite Elliot's interest in her, Julie would never reciprocate - because Elliot has a beard, and Julie hates them.\n\nThis film is a case of too many cooks, as this screenplay was worked over by several writers. The premise is flimsy, for starters, and I fear Russell is miscast. Rosalind Russell in films is a beautiful woman, but she has a strength and intelligence about her as well. It's not an ing\u00e9nue beauty. In the world of \"The Feminine Touch,\" despite her tailored suits, every man who meets her falls madly in love with her. I could have bought it if it had been Lana Turner. I'm not buying it here. Women like Russell are the \"whole package\" and men fall for her in a different way and probably after a conversation or two - not on sight. And then, to have a smart woman like Julie upset because her husband never gets jealous is ridiculous. It might bother an immature 18-year-old, but this character? The end of the film -- which comes about 15 minutes later than it should have - is the best part, as it turns into a more screwball comedy with Julie setting fire to Elliot's beard and other crazy things happening. Otherwise, the film drags on with too much dialogue. I'm not opposed to dialogue - All About Eve has a large amount of dialogue. This dialogue was superfluous, probably because a scene or two could have been tossed.\n\nHeflin proves himself as adept at comedy as he is at drama, Francis is delightful, as is Ameche, who makes a good professorial type. Someone mentioned the clothing - Francis wears one hat that looks like a rendition of the Mickey Mouse Club ears, except with taller ears and the entire hat covered in fur. It was one of the funniest things in the movie.",

Don Ameche is a psychology professor at Digby College, which he decides to leave after being asked to pass a dimwitted football player so Digby can win an upcoming game. Prof. Hathaway is now free to publish his book on his theories on marital jealousy. Only he doesn't expect to be smitten with his editor, Kay Francis and likewise his wife, Rosalind Russell with Kay Francis' partner, Van Heflin. It's not heavy on plot; rather, its forte is in its snappy dialog, especially from Russell and Francis.\n\nHere is one thing I especially love about 40's/50's romantic comedies: the bachelor pads, such as Van Heflin's here! They're always large and usually have a sunken living room with lots of cool furniture. You go up three steps and behold! A grand piano! As if this weren't enough, Heflin's also got a log cabin retreat outside the city (NY). Other outstanding 1940's visuals: Kay Francis' outrageous hats. Francis looks even better here than in the 30's. She even reminded me somewhat of Sean Young in BLADE RUNNER. Other highlights include the make-up exam Prof. Hathaway gives to Rubber-Legs, the football player in question at the beginning, at the request of the dean. The questions are deliberately idiotic, but Rubber-Legs bows out with a headache! For more abuse of football players at the hands of professors I recommend Disney's THE MONKEY'S UNCLE (24 years later). Then there's the scene in the publisher's office where Ameche and Russell find claustrophobic Elliott Morgan (Heflin) locked in a closet by Nellie (Francis)! Funny seeing a bearded Heflin through the keyhole. There's also a lot of coffee preparing and drinking in this movie, and some kind of statement about beards. At the beginning the football players are wearing beards until they defeat their opponent. Later, Francis declares that Elliott is hiding behind a beard for security (??) We're also treated to some 1940's feminism spouted by Don Ameche and scoffed at by Francis, who says those are the women (overly independent) who are alone at night.\n\nThis is a sprightly comedy with sturdy comedic performances from all.

Good acting is required here too, because much is conveyed through the actors eyes. Scenes with Russell, Francis, Heflin, and Ameche all on screen at once are a real treat, and no one upstages anyone else. I would guess they had fun making this funny picture, which is underrated by many people who do not follow the actors' exchanges.\n\nLook too, for Robert Ryan who is uncredited in his early pre-war days, and an uncredited song by a barely 21 year-old Peggy Lee, who had just joined Benny Goodman's Band; and oh, my, you can hear her rich, cool, perfect pitch starting to come alive.",

Someone above mentioned Lana Turner, but she would have been too young at this time. Also, Roz plays it like a half-wit, something Lamarr wouldn't have to resort to, as a war-bride who had trouble with American idioms and customs. Ameche, Heflin and Francis are terrific as usual, as is the rest of the supporting cast. And I loved the production design, van Heflin's couch and lamps in his NY apartment are particularly terrifying, as is Kay Francis's \"beaver-mouse ears\" hat. And I LOVE that Dali-esquire dream sequence. Someone ought to do a compilation of the Dali-inspired dream sequences from the period. There were lots.",

This only adds to his frustration of bored, inattentive students, and he quits. He has written a book about jealousy, which a publishing company has shown interest in publishing it. He and wife Rosalind Russell go off to New York to meet the publisher. But, Roz is a human female wife, who wants her husband to act alive and jealous, and Don is too reasonable to be reduced to such feelings, which have no scientific basis for them. The publisher Van Heflin takes a liking to Roz, but his secretary Kay Francis has been pining for him all this time. Such is the zany premise in this feel-good comedy. As usual, Roz is at her best with quick lines and her short temper, demanding Don do something about Van. And, a misunderstanding on a bus gets Don in jail. Kay Francis is great, in this escape from her usual fare of melodramas in which she is suffering from shame and scandal and doing and dying for love of her man. Van Heflin is a hoot as a neurotic, who won't let Roz out of his sight and who only has one thing on his mind. The cast winds up on an island, where things get really hysterical. If you want to discover a new screwball comedy, after seeing all of Cary Grant's, then discover The Feminine Touch and see what trouble it gets you.",

While she does love him, his refusal to act like a human being irritates her to no end--especially when he never shows an ounce of jealousy, no matter what she does. Even when Rosalind spends time with her husband's publisher, the lecherous Van Heflin, Ameche refuses to act jealous and he takes his marriage for granted. At first, I found Russell's demands for jealousy to be petty, but after a while I wondered how any woman could live with the cold and annoying Ameche. Only later in the film when Ameche loosened up and showed his wife that he cared was everyone able to live happily ever after.\n\nThis is a little comedy from MGM that tries very hard to entertain and generally does, though at times the humor does seem a tad forced. However, despite this and the shallowness of the script, the actors are fun to watch and the film has a certain kooky charm that make it a nice, though not especially deep, time-passer.

The movie is far too talky, although that talk often is quite witty (and just as often seems implausible and pointless), and goes on far too long. The slapstick bits are weak.

She comes across as a bit addle-pated at times but she also has an enormous amount of patience with her husband, a good but not very sensitive man.\n\nThis was Kay Francis' last part in an A level film and a shame since she is both humorous and chic. Her slide into low grade junk and obscurity within a few years of this is an example of the way Hollywood wastes talented performers once they are no longer as big at the box office. Since this is an MGM film and she made a good showing in the picture it's surprising they didn't take her on. Her brand of sophistication seems right up their alley and even if no longer a leading lady she could have done well in support.\n\nAmeche's character as I said is a rather clueless blow-hard but his natural charm makes him less irksome than he would normally be. Heflin, fresh off his Oscar for Johnny Eager, is well cast as a would be gigolo who thinks he is more suave and irresistible than he in fact is. \n\nOverall a bit dated in it's attitudes, unsurprisingly, but the four stars make it worth watching.",

Once I saw an Ogden Nash writing credit I figured this could have some interesting dialogue, however brief.\n\nThe basic premise of women want men to get violent if another man approaches or even smiles at them is simply ridiculous. The theme was meant for troglodytes and imagine the comedy was expected to spew forth from this treatise. I could only agree on one issue: men with beards are gross! Ever try to have a decent make out session with one?? ICK!\n\nMen get jealous over women they could care less about, it's mostly about looking superior and they rarely feel that let alone appear in this manner.

Like some of the other commentators, I didn't get the movie's fascination with beards. What was that all about? Kay Francis and Rosalind Russell were playing the wrong roles. Russell should have done better as the wisecracking assistant and Francis as the put-upon wife. Seemed odd. Maybe Metro was trying to re-shape Russell's image. And what was with that immense hat Kay Francis wore in one scene, perhaps the night club scene? It looked several large bats had been sacrificed for it. She could wear anything with aplomb, but that hat was near the far margin, even for her.

Imagining bigger stars or unknowns instead of either of the male leads is futile. The plot needed more fixing than the casting.\n\nProfessor Hathaway (Don Ameche)- throughout played an educated fool. Maybe this type was of distinctive interest back then, I have no patience now for that. There are so many people like that, now, in reality. He did not deserve a happy ending; I would have him killed off by accident at some point - which presented itself in a perfect set-up for a grisly death by a caught tie in an outboard motor.. it turned into a meaningless plot device.

I haven't seen many Heflin movies; he was so despicable - relatively, he did not deserve a happy ending either.\n\nRussell and Francis.. well, they should have told off Heflin and tied him up and taken his clothes...and start to go at each other, but after the first slap should have walked off into the sunset together. The End. Or at least for the 2014 version. Which part for Jodie Foster?\n\nBeard[?!] Then I guess I'm growing a fur coat on my face.

First, he simply doesn't come off as a playboy, and he looks plain goofy in that goatee. His character is not just the \"bad guy\", but there's nothing at all likable or intriguing about him. Put someone like Tyrone Power in the role (funny I'd think of him, considering how good he was in films with Don Ameche) and you'd have some sizzle.

You people are looking at an art form that was directed at children from a more innocent, more naive and certainly less street smart than today's youngsters. These serials were meant only to entertain, not instruct. We kids realize that it was only a movie, but nevertheless it was fun to speculate how the hero was going to going to get out of a certain situation. They were not shown before the main feature, as is commonly stated, but were the last item on the matin\u00e9e bill. They were the dessert after the meal. Theaters usually ran them to bring the youngsters back particularly if they were in competition with the theater down the street. They were entertainment pure and simple, with plenty of action to hold the kids attention. After all, the kids had had a full week of education shoved down their throats. How many kids would have come to see a movie about the signing of the Declaration of Independence, or the Pilgrims or some other historical event. Saturday afternoons were made for fun.

The animated title card at the beginning is a nice touch by Universal, which did the same for The Mystery of the Riverboat.\n\nMilburn Stone has to be the most beat-up, bruised, drowned, shot and has been in the most near-death truck plunges of any action hero in any serial. The story notes that to begin with his character is a wounded soldier returning home.  Martin Kosleck makes a great scientist/bad guy, though he does not quite yet have the evil glee that he threw into those roles in later years (such as in The Flesh Eaters). Edgar Kennedy is almost unrecognizable, but provides some nice comic touches. The rest of the cast is pretty unremarkable, except for Anthony Warde, who delivers his usual solid performance as the main henchman.\n\nThere are a lot of nice visuals in this serial, though many are obviously stock footage.  There are also a number of really bad cliffhangers...the kind in which you know there is no bloody way the hero is going to survive. That doesn't necessarily detract from the chapterplay as a whole, since by the time the worst one happens (involving a falling mine elevator and a crate of dynamite) you already know that Milburn Stone's character can really take the punishment.\n",

In between, Eddie and Soapy (Ates) help a trouble shooting circuit judge find a long lost son and bring justice to Rawhide City.\n\nWhen you see them both together, it's remarkable how much Dean and Ates look alike, with Roscoe being an older version. The Soapy character was actually Dean's second screen comedic sidekick, Emmett \"Pappy\" Lynn worked with Eddie in earlier films.\n\nIn the story, a cowpoke named Nevada (David Sharpe) goes undercover to infiltrate a gang that may be robbing gold shipments. At first, Eddie is unaware of Nevada's role, and they really bang it out in a wild saloon fight that's one of the more realistic ones you'll see in a 'B' Western. Later, it's revealed that the mastermind behind the gold robberies is the same villain who Judge Hilton (Forrest Taylor) put in jail thirty years earlier. \"Dad\" Dillon (Warner Richmond) kidnapped the judge's son when he broke out and raised him as his own. \"Duke\" Dillon is now the town boss of Rawhide City, who'll learn his true origin just before he eats dust at the hands of \"Dad\".\n\nEddie Dean began his film career in the mid 1930's, appearing in back up roles to Hopalong Cassidy. Prior to that, he made his mark as part of a singing trio on Gene Autry's Melody Ranch Radio Program. Dean has his backers that will claim he was the best of the singing cowboys, and that's probably not far from the truth. \"Colorado Serenade\" showcases his talent quite well with a host of songs, and he finishes one up with a low key yodel.\n\nWhile many movie cowboys were synonymous with their horses, Dean chose to appear with four different steeds in his films, on the assumption that he wouldn't be upstaged by any of them. His mount in this picture is a palomino named White Cloud. Actually, Dean had a reputation for being fairly generous with his fellow actors, allowing them center stage when the story called for it.\n\nA final bit of trivia - though other Westerns were made before in color, Eddie Dean was the first to do a series of films in color, with five films for PRC in the 1940's. On that account, he managed to beat Roy and Gene to the draw.",

There's a corrupt saloon and mine owner played by Warner Richmond who with his son Dennis Moore has the illegal activities pretty well organized. Taylor is going to be a kind of Judge Seabury and Dean and Ates are on the commission.\n\nWhat is revealed by the film is a prior relationship with Taylor, Richmond and Moore that is the key to the whole film. In the end corruption is driven from Rawhide.\n\nDean has a couple of nice songs to sing including the public domain Home On The Range which every singing cowboy did a version of. Colorado Serenade is a pleasant enough film, quite a revelation for a PRC release to be done in color.",

            "Eddie Dean and Soapy Jones foil an attempted stagecoach holdup designed to murder Circuit Judge Hilton, bound for Rawhide to restore law and order. The Judge and the other passenger, Parson Trimble, decide to put up at the ranch owned by Sherry Lynn, Eddie's sweetheart, and her mother Ma Lynn. They are waylaid again, but the outlaws are driven off, and Nevada, an undercover man for the Judge, allows one of captured men to escape so he can follow him to the gang hideout. The Judge also deputizes Eddie. Nevada gets in with the gang, led by Duke and Dad Dillon, and is given the assignment to kill the Judge, whose first act in Rawhide was to close Duke's saloon and fire the city manager, Colonel Blake, a hireling of the Dillons. Eddie, Nevada and Soapy find evidence at the Dillon mine that they have been stealing government gold shipments. Colonel Blake is preparing to skip town and reveals to Sherry and saloon-girl Lola, Duke's girlfriend, that Duke is really the son of Judge Hilton, kidnapped in infancy by Dillon as an act of revenge. The Dillons and Eddie and his men are in a gunfight outside of the Palace Saloon when the Judge, having learned that Duke is is son, goes out to look for him. Duke, not believing the story, is looking to kill the Judge."

The film is actually a compilation of scenes from three previous Frank Buck films; funny, but you never hear his name or that of Clyde Beatty any more, the two most famous animal trappers of all time. This documentary style film is narrated by Buck with the benefit of hindsight during most of the segments, since the movies they were culled from were made in the early and mid-Thirties.\n\nA lot of the scenes presented here are really rather intriguing, particularly the ones in which wild animals square off against each other. There's a tiger vs. black leopard draw, followed quickly by a scenario in which the same (?) black leopard tussles a huge python and is crushed in the effort. It's really rather gruesome when you think about it, maybe not the best thing for young kids to watch.\n\nThe trapping methods Buck utilizes range from the mundane to quite ingenious, and it surprised me that the man didn't use any protective gear of any kind, not even gloves. So when another python grabs his arm unexpectedly he winds up the next couple of hours pulling it's teeth out. One particularly humorous capture involved his running after and tackling a baby elephant, a mere two hundred pound infant that four Malay natives had to carry back to their camp in a sling.\n\nProbably the most innovative capture involved setting a large net trap on the ground for a black leopard, attached to the top of a tree that was bowed nearly halfway down it's length and secured by a rope. When the animal went after a chicken used for bait, the camouflaged net was triggered by cutting the rope and the leopard was left upended. Following most of the captures, the animal was hustled inside a cage, ready for transport to one of the many zoos in America that commissioned Buck for his prize animals.\n\nAll in all this is really a fascinating look at a man who made his living for a solid decade risking his life to secure wild animals for zoos and circuses around the world. He sums up his mission with a thoughtful slogan emphasizing his respect for all of nature - 'Be Prepared, Be Resourceful, and Be Gone'.",

The film reports of the events of its life, the following 40 years until 1938 - of its 2 loves and losses... The action is on the one hand interesting, partly exciting and dramatic, in addition sensitive and thoughtful. The film has, which today became very rare, mind. The action does not exhibit \"lengths\", it is taut and well developed and build up. All actors are convincing in their roles and it is easy to identify with several persons of the film (especially you will close Margarete Haagen in your heart, in her representation of the self-willed but heart-good doctors aid). The camera guidance is imaginative and moved, no trace static (one regards only the \"roundabout scene\"). The photography is very atmospheric and intense. The Decorations are on the one hand complex, on the other hand consciously taken back however very effectively, so that the atmosphere and tendency of the time are convincingly obtained - this applies especially to the action up to 1914. The film music is high-quality and skillfully and effectively used. All together a wonderful experience to have seen this film - a little jewel.",

There are a couple of slow patches \u0096 chiefly two or three dialogue exchanges between Carson and Wyman which sharper film editing should have trimmed away.

Whatever will we do?\" It wasn't even the idea of having sex outside of marriage that was so horrifying. It was just being in the same room. Maybe an audience in 1944 would have understood that, but in 2005 the reaction is \"Who the hell cares if they're married? You don't plan to have sex, don't have sex. Keep your clothes on if you want to. But shut up already about whether you're married or not.\" It's just too stupid for anybody to care about.",

They only way that Walter can get Jerry to work for him is to tell Jerry that his life is in danger; the neighbor is trying to take his wife; and that Nazi spies are everywhere. Jerry needs a cook for his 'cover' so he gets his fianc\u00e9e Susan to work with him. To keep Jerry working, Walter sends the threatening letters to himself and hires actors to play the spies. It soon becomes apparent that Susan cannot cook and Jerry could not find a spy if he tripped over him."
