                "text": "I have the honor of being the first to review this superb film.\n\nThe story opens with workers in a Sicilian sulfur mine on strike 400 meters below the earth's surface. The mine is no longer profitable and they have no other source of income. We come to know them and their women folk, as they decide to be guided to France where there is the promise of work. Raf Vallone plays Saro, their unofficial leader. He is the widowed father of 3 children. Joining their group is Barbara, a young unmarried woman living with the disreputable Vanni who is a lawbreaker. There is the older accountant, and a young couple who marry just before departing. And there are several young men, including a singer and guitarist.\n\nWhen they get to Rome, they run into police problems due to Vanni's presence. Later they must face and surmount yet other obstacles as their guide has abandoned them.\n\nThe screenplay has 2 credits and the story has 3 credits, including Frederico Fellini and the director Pietro Germi. They miss no opportunity to draw out the human element, often in small bits and pieces of action, and these small details are what contribute to making this a great picture. But really the larger bits of action equally add to the impact. There are no moments of screen time in which we are not involved intensely with some revelations of character, or the social conditions, or the human conditions. There is enormous understanding and empathy going into what we see on the screen. Even more amazing is that the direction and cinematography bring this out in the acting, which is always completely natural. The film editor has known exactly when to show us a hand, an eye, a look, a stare, a smile, a tear, a panorama, a knife, and for how long to show them. And the music score fits them.\n\nA great deal of the picture is filmed outside studios, in town, city, farm, pastoral and mountain locales. While it is all natural, the filmmakers have evidently exercised great care in composing the shots to heighten the communication and impact. The same is the case for the interior shots, and they use deep focus photography quite often, with figures in the foreground and background being shown with subdued lighting. Evidently, great skill was used in creating what we see on the screen. Neo-realism is not merely filming reality. It actually is the creation of a new heightened experience that uses a palette of the real.\n\nThe overall effect is highly emotional. Adding to it are the background reactions of the supporting actors to the main actions. These are always of interest and utterly natural, even when or especially when the children are involved. The directing is excellent.\n\nThe gripping nature of this film and perhaps all neo-realist films of the period may be arising from the unpredictable course of the story. In that respect, it mirrors life itself. There are several occasions in this story when surprise \"switches\" occur that turn the action 180 degrees in an opposite direction for at least some of the characters, and yet these switches are entirely natural and not concocted. We come to moments where a decision has been taken, it seems, and yet just as naturally, the opposite occurs within a few moments as people change their minds. Or else, we come to places where we can't predict what a person will do, and we wait to see what he or she is going to decide. And we are involved with them as this happens.\n\nThis is really a stupendous film and a tremendous credit to Italian neo-realism. There is a temptation to compare it with other such great works like \"La Strada\" and \"Open City\", but rather than succumb to that, I'd rather just say that this cinema, this body of work, is very simply all a treasure for viewers and for filmmakers of today and tomorrow.",

In Rome, Ciccio points out Vanni to the police. In the shoot-out, both Vanni and Ciccio escape. The others are arrested.

                "text": "Charles McGraw was one of the all-time best at playing tough guy roles in Hollywood. He was never anything but totally convincing in those roles, either. It has to be his distinctive gravel voice, along with his manly facial features and mannerisms, but also the fact he seemed to always play these kind of characters. All of this stamped him as a rough thug, no matter what side of the law he was on and the older he got, the more chiseled his face and rougher the voice. By 1950, he - along with big Sterling Hayden - were the two best males in the film noir genre, in my opinion. Both men were always interesting and both hit peaks in the very early '50s.\n\nIn this film, McGraw is the main criminal, \"Red Kluger,\" a man who has just busted out of Folsom Prison. He immediately goes after the two guys most responsible for putting him behind bars, captures then and then goes on the lam with a stolen truck, a couple of other thugs and the kidnapped driver of the big truck.\n\nAt only 65 minutes, this moves by pretty fast, although there is a lull halfway through until things start to get tense as the cops get closer and closer. The \"Inspector,\" by the way, is Robert Shayne, who played \"Inspector Henderson\" on the Superman TV show in the 1950s. The only difference was that he had a mustache in this movie.\n\nOne credibility problem: the truck driver, \"Joe,\" could have escaped a few times, especially with his riding partner up front got out of the cab to talk to a cop! What a perfect chance to slip out his side and run for it...but he stays in the driver's seat (with nobody looking at him?) Oh, well; no film is perfect.\n\nThe climax was fine, offering some tense moments and a surprise finish regarding the hostages and crooks. Overall, a pretty solid film noir and one that, hopefully, will be available on DVD.",

To say nothing of the numerous television appearances he made. I can not envision too many actors taking this role and fully making it his own the way Mr.McGraw did. Even though his \"look\" left him for the most part typecast, he was one of our best character actors and \"The Threat\" bears the proof.

He creates a tension-filled atmosphere, keeps things moving at a crisp pace, deftly establishes and stokes conflicts, and can usually be counted on for one \"bravura\" piece of camerawork in every film (here, it takes place at the climax in the desert shack). He was just a very sound and capable filmmaker.\n\nWhat also seemed to stand out about his work was how single-mindedly sadistic and downright mean his bad guys were. Here, Charles McGraw plays an escaped convict whose thirst for revenge against the detective and D.A. who put him away, really fuels the film and keeps it on track. McGraw emerges as very controlled, coiled and menacingly methodical. It's a good part and a very fine performance - the guy just doesn't give an inch and you find yourself having to respect that.\n\nGenerally, when low budget crime movies fail it's because the bad guy is stupid or lets his guard down at a crucial moment - none of that here. McGraw is going out on a limb with his plan and he knows sooner or later that limb is probably going to snap, but the way he figures it it's well worth the risk.\n\n",

And who better to act out the gritty script than the jut-jawed McGraw, a role that fits him like a glove. And when he barks out orders to his underlings, I had to remind myself I wasn't included. If there were B-movie Oscars, which there should have been, he would be richly deserving.\n\nAnyhow, the plot manages to turn the familiar prison break fugitive into an exciting chase across California, replete with a number of clever touches and a few surprises from an unflinching camera. I also like Virginia Grey (Carol) who specialized in sad-eyed, soulful parts as she does here. Still, I'm not sure the movie did O'Shea's (Ray) career much good since he's definitely second fiddle to the all-dominating Mc Graw.

Just about as scary a movie criminal as there ever was. Scary because criminals like this actually do exist, and a great little film like this brings the audience enough into the movie that you can't help but think \"what if I were kidnapped by a homicidal lunatic like this?\" At 65 minutes, \"The Threat\" is a very tight film noir type crime drama filled with tension, and Charles McGraw is the center of picture.

In the course of just over an hour, his violent mission for revenge takes him on a road trip where the excitement never lets up. There are several close calls for the criminals disguised as delivery truck drivers with the kidnapped victims in the hull, gagged inside a car. But the three victims have their own plan up their sleeve even though the female witness (Virginia Grey in one of her rare leads) seems to have divided loyalties.\n\nWhile there have been many movies about prison breaks, a lot of them end up being predictable or going off on plot twists which are straight out of an Indiana Jones movie. This peaks with a stand-off between police at a train crossing and later at a gas station. It all culminates at an abandoned shack where the gangsters find themselves at the mercy of their own victims and one not yet caught gangster determined to get back in control. Charles McGraw is ruthless and seemingly unstoppable as the head of this gang of violent criminals, while Michael O'Shea is a tough yet law-abiding (and more importantly, honest) cop. It's Virginia Grey, however, who stands out, giving a thrilling performance as the less than savory female who may or may not have given key private testimony without taking the stand. She's come a long way since insulting Joan Crawford behind the perfume counter in \"The Women\"!",

Ray Williams, Michael O'Shea, and D.A Baker McDonald, Frank Conroy, are in serious danger. Kluger swore that they'll pay for what they did to him and now he's to keep his promise. That's By kidnapping the two with the help of his fellow hoods Nick Damon & Lefty, Anthony Cruso & Frank Richards, and holding them as hostages in this rundown shack in the middle of the California Desert! Not only that Kluger kidnaps his former gun moll night club singer Ann Williams, Julie Bishop, who he feels ratted him out to the police as well as took off with the $100,000.00 in cash he hid in a bus locker in downtown L.A. Still on a roll Kluger hijacks a moving truck together with it's driver Joe Turner, Don McGuire, to make his getaway amid some dozen police and state trooper road blocks. This all within the first 15 minutes of the movie! What a busy guy this Kluger is!\n\nNow in the middle of nowhere in the hot and dry California Desert the Kluger gang wait for pilot Tony Anzo (Ben Weldon), Ann's former boyfriend, to land pick up and fly them to safety across the border into Mexico. It's in fact Tony who can clear up this confusion in Kluger's mind if Ann really took the cash he had hidden away and ratted him out to the police! Which makes you wonder on which side, the police or Kluger gang, that she's on!\n\n**SPOILERS** As you would have expected in that there's no honor among crooks in that it's in fact Kluuger and his gang who end up doing themselves in before the police show up. There's also Ann who's on Kluger's sh*t list and whom he treats like dirt during the entire movie who in the end is the one person who ends up blasting him with his own gun: The only one of the Kluger gang's guns that had live bullets in them.\n\nP.S The John Garfield looking tough guy actor Michael O'Shea fit perfectly in the part as detective Ray Williams in him coming from a long line of police family members, all his five brothers ended up being cops, himself.

                "text": "As a general rule, the only people who are allowed to be good with guns in a movie belong to one of three categories: (1) policemen and other law enforcement officials, as well as prosecuting attorneys; (2) criminals and immoral women; and (3) military personnel, including veterans. But civilians who own guns usually just get themselves killed. If the civilian does not buy the gun himself, but simply gains possession of it somehow, he is allowed to use the gun effectively. But if he buys the gun himself, he is doomed. In short, movies tend to support the position of gun-control advocates, who argue that civilians are more likely to hurt themselves by owning a handgun. Those, on the other hand, who believe that it is a good idea for civilians to own a gun, who support the idea of the armed citizen, will often be exasperated by the way civilians are portrayed in movies as being incompetent with guns that they own. But this movie is the absolute worst of them all in this regard.\n\nKluger, who was on death row in Folsom Prison, manages to escape. He had sworn revenge against the detective who arrested him and the prosecuting attorney who convicted him, and soon kidnaps them, along with Carol, the girlfriend of his partner Tony, because he suspects her of informing on him. Kluger and his two henchman, Nick and Lefty, pack up their captives and a lot of stuff, and put them in a moving van so they can drive to a place and meet up with Tony. That is where the civilian comes in. His name is Joe, and he owns the moving van, which he is forced to drive. And he owns a gun.\n\nJoe is supposed to drive the van with Lefty sitting in the cab with him. Everyone else is hidden in the van. Just before Lefty gets in the cab, Joe lowers his visor and grabs his gun. He could easily shoot Lefty and then take off running, but he chickens out and puts the gun back. Later, they come upon a roadblock, where there are several cops looking for Kluger. One of the cops opens the door of the cab to talk to Joe. All Joe would have to do is dive out of the cab and let the cops take care of Lefty, but he just sits there instead. Never mind that Kluger, known to be a vicious killer, is not going to let him live once he is no longer useful, and so Joe has nothing to lose by making a break for it, he is apparently too timid to risk it.\n\nWhen they stop at a filling station for gas, Joe retrieves his gun and hides it on his person while Lefty is dealing with a policeman. He should do something right then, but he doesn't. Eventually, they arrive at a cabin, where they wait for Tony. While everyone is asleep, Joe pulls out his gun. He should just start shooting, but he wakes everyone up instead. Oh well, at least he has the drop on them. He can get the detective and the prosecutor in the next room to take their guns away from the gangsters and all will be well. But Kluger starts walking toward Joe, talking to him in a soothing tone of voice, saying it was a mistake to pull out the gun. \"Come on, give it here,\" Kluger says, as he gently reaches out his hand and takes the gun away from Joe without any resistance. \"Now, isn't that better?\" Kluger asks. Joe smiles and says, \"Yeah.\" And then Kluger shoots him.\n\nJoe gets the award for being the biggest loser civilian with a handgun in cinematic history. Once the audience has been taught the lesson that it is a mistake for a civilian to buy a gun and try to use it to defend himself, the rest is just routine. The only people left are those who movies allow are capable of using a gun, and so it is just a matter of time before one of them gets his hands on a gun and uses it competently. As it turns out, Carol, who is qualified to use a gun on account of her being a cheap gangster's moll, picks up Kluger's pistol and points it at him. This time Kluger knows he is in trouble, because she is not a spineless civilian like Joe, whom he can coax the gun away from. He begs for mercy, but she puts two slugs in him, and it's all over.",

There are several good cavalry-Indian battles in this film which was the American debut of Mexican movie star Linda Cristal, who is Andrews' love interest. The music score is decent but the warbling by Alfred Perry and company is out of place in this kind of western. It is also worth noting that several lines of dialogue in this film were lifted verbatim from Elliott Arnold's excellent work, \"Blood Brother\", which details the Apache wars and the friendship between Cochise and Tom Jeffords. Many of Quanah Parker's ideas of war and peace were taken word-for-word from Arnold's novel and attributed to the Comanche chief to portray him as the sage leader of \"the lords of the south plains\".

Aside from more modern sensibilities about the American Indians (they aren't savage or bad and there is an attempt to understand their motivations), there really isn't anything different to set this apart from hundreds, if not thousands of mediocre Westerns from the 40s and 50s.\n\nPart of the problem was in casting Kent Smith as the Indian chief. He was a good journeyman actor, but here he was all wrong. While his character was supposed to have SOME White blood, Smith looked and sounded about as much like an Indian as Shirley Temple! It's odd that although the script is quite sensitive and \"politically correct\" by today's standards, they still used a lot of White actors in makeup as the Indians (if you look, you'll also notice Mike Mazurki as an Indian as well).\n\nAnother part of the problem is that while I like Dana Andrews a lot, I've got to admit he was pretty bland in the part--a part which would have been more convincing had it featured Randolph Scott or Jimmy Stewart. Andrews just wasn't believable as a cavalry scout in the old West. Andrews forte was in contemporary stories--placing him in a horse and Indian film just seemed unnatural and his performance reflects this.\n\nAside from these complaints, I am not recommending you avoid the film--it is fairly entertaining and won't rot your brain.

The other would have to be the finale where Chief Quanah Parker (Kent Smith) doesn't interfere in the battle between the Cavalry and Black Cloud's (Henry Brandon) renegade band of Comanches. As an aside, I would also go so far as to suggest that I've never seen as many Indians in one place at one time on the movie screen.\n\nDana Andrews portrays cavalry scout Jim Read, by now relegated to films of lesser quality than those in which he gained his stature as a genuine Hollywood star (1944's \"Laura\" and 1946's \"The Best Years Of Our Lives\"). Producers considered him an actor of limited range and it didn't help his reputation that he drank too much. Andrews appeared competent here, although the role didn't call for a lot more than your typical cavalry Western. The story matched him up with partner Nestor Paiva as an old salt frontiersman named Puffer. Apparently it was someone's idea to have Paiva resurrect the character of Gabby Hayes, but doing a Walter Brennan impersonation. That kept me off balance for a while, but I did get a chuckle out of Mike Mazurki calling black jack on Puffer in one scene.\n\nThe other casting decision of note was the American film debut of Linda Cristal, who I would not have recognized apart from her starring role in 'The High Chapparal'. The pace of her relationship with Read seemed a bit forced, particularly given the circumstances of her capture by the Comanches.\n\nCatching the film the other day on Turner Classics, I was impressed by the color cinematography given the era. Offered in wide screen letterbox format, the film makers took full advantage of the natural beauty in the Durango area of Old Mexico. Where they could have improved though was the selection of a theme song; the bouncy beat of \"A man is as good as his word\" kept me making an unintentional comparison to the \"Bonanza\" TV series, quite expecting to see the Cartwrights round the corner at any moment.

By this I mean Hollywood woke up to the fact that the indigenous Native Americans had a raw deal from history and Hollywood movies featuring whooping injuns portrayed as violent savages weren't helping matters much hence in the late 1960s and early 70s you'd get movies like SOLDIER BLUE and LITTLE BIG MAN and later still we had DANCES WITH WOLVES that showed the wild west through the eyes of the Indians . This 1956 film called COMANCHE pre-dates these revisionary Westerns where the poor noble misunderstood savage is set upon by the white man \n\nActually it doesn't because from the outset we're shown it's the Mexican/Hispanic community who are all to blame . We're given a short history lesson that when Spain conquered Mexico the Spanish held the Comanches at gunpoint and made them work down the mines gathering silver . Understandably the native population were a bit angry about this and revolted leading to the Spanish to stamp upon them . After Mexico gained its independence the slaughter continued with Mexicans putting a bounty on Indian scalps 100 dollars for a warrior , 50 dollars for a squaw and 25 dollars for a child\n\n\" Wow Theo that is so cruel and if anyone did that today they'd be getting arrested and tried for crimes against humanity at The Hague \" \n\nUndoubtedly and rightly but you have to ask yourself a rhetorical question that would the native population of the United States be getting a better deal ? No they wouldn't this film tends to ignore this and seems to portray the United States White Anglo-Saxon Protestant as being morally superior to that of their Hispanic neighbours who are portrayed as being as untrustworthy but are very good guitar players and it's left to an American WASP to save the day \n\nThis cultural arrogance is not so much offensive but a great pity because COMANCHE did have some potential to be a good Western that would have appealed to people who don't like the Western genre . It does try to push the boat out against the Hays Code by having a slightly sadistic streak but then sabotages it by including a couple of songs over the soundtrack",

Yet I have seen many B-grade westerns that are superior to this utterly pedestrian effort at film-making. In fact, the color film is the only thing about this movie that is decent. The cinematography, itself, is unremarkable. The scenery, shown once would have been unremarkable, too. The same location shown repeatedly, however, is laughable.\n\nWorst of all is the soundtrack. The Lancers' upbeat, ersatz-folk sound is hopelessly out of sync with the story, giving the film a kind of schizophrenic quality. The songs, with a change of lyrics, would be better suited to a Frankie and Annette film of the same era - or an upbeat Disney movie.\n\nThen there's the acting - or better stated as a question - where's the acting? In particular, I have never been able to understand how Dana Andrews ever had a career in film. He is absolutely the most wooden actor ever seen in Hollywood. His delivery is the same whether he is portraying a film noir tough guy or an Indian scout. His face always has the exact same expression - utterly impassive. Whether his character is experiencing joy or sorrow, his face looks exactly the same. Who told this guy he could act? He must have had the dope on a lot of Hollywood big-wigs to have been cast in films - even as an extra! The rest of the cast is apparently mimicking other actors - the Gabby Hayes wannabe, the Stewart Granger wannabe, the Dolores Del Rio wannabe. They are all pretty much on autopilot - delivering caricatures rather than portraying characters.\n\nThe question I have whenever I subject myself to an abomination such as this is: Who is most to blame - the actors or the director? Did the director actually want these actors to act as they did, or was he simply incapable of getting anything else out of them? What would Ed Wood have accomplished with a budget such as this director had at his disposal?",

Love the colors and the backgrounds are very nice. Excellent voice work from Mel Blanc. Carl Stalling's music is energetic and fun.

                "text": "While the Sylvester and Tweety cartoon 'Hyde and Go Tweet' is the better take on the classic Jekyll and Hyde story, being funnier and more creative, 'Hyde and Hare' is still very entertaining in its own right.\n\n'Hyde and Hare's' chief weak point is the ending. With the exception of Bugs's final line, which is pretty amusing, you can smell it from a mile off, Bugs's Hyde character is rather ugly and not frightening enough and the cartoon would have been two-joke if there was enough done with Bugs in the Hyde guise. Instead the ending scene felt rushed and in comparison to Dr Jekyll as Hyde there was nowhere near enough time dedicated to Bugs as Hyde. This viewer also does somewhat agree that the story is a touch thin and stretched, and also a touch repetitive (always a danger with one-joke cartoons).\n\nOn the other hand, the animation (as was the case with most 1950s Looney Tunes cartoons) is very nice, typical Fritz Freleng, and the one element that is- slightly- better than 'Hyde and Go Tweet's', which was still very good but made at a time where the Looney Tunes cartoons' budgets were starting to get lower and animation getting cheaper (though it only started to get bad in the mid-60s with primarily the Daffy and Speedy series and the later Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote shorts. In 'Hyde and Hare' the backgrounds are fluid and colourful, the colours are bright and quite attractive to look at, Bugs and Dr. Jekyll are drawn well and Dr. Jekyll as Hyde this viewer personally found pretty frightening.\n\nCarl Stalling, a consistently great composer and my personal favourite for the Looney Tunes cartoons (like Milt Franklyn's scores a lot too, much less keen on Bill Lava's) provides a characteristically jaunty and characterful music score. It's lushly orchestrated, haunting in places (especially the opening credits) and syncs with the gags excellently and even enhances them (Franklyn was also very good at doing this, Lava's a good deal of the time were cheap-sounding, repetitive and even misplaced).\n\nThere are funnier, more creative and less predictable Looney Tunes shorts, sure, but the dialogue is still clever and witty- Bugs bagging all the best lines, particularly the one quoted in the review summary, Dr Jekyll's comparatively is ever so slightly bland and repetitive- and the gags range from amusing to hilarious. 'Hyde and Hare' is paced efficiently and Freleng (one of the more famous and popular Looney Tunes directors, second to Chuck Jones) directs with energy, his directorial and animation style unmistakable. Bugs' distinctive personality shines brilliantly, his energy and actions getting increasingly manic, while Dr Jekyll is a good, understated (if much less funny) contrast, the rapport between the two never coming across as dull, which is good because it is the thing that holds 'Hyde and Hare' together. Mel Blanc's voice work is faultless, once again showing the unparallelled ability to voice more than one character in the same cartoon and give them different and individual personalities to one another.\n\nAll in all, very entertaining. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

One day, when Bugs goes up to retrieve a carrot from the man, he decides that he would like to just live with him and be done with it. The man seems to be very gentle, kind and quite delicate and takes to the (talking) rabbit, bringing him to his house. We later find out that the man is a doctor and has an evil potion that can temperamentally turn him into a monster.

Maybe we expect so much from the crowd behind the Looney Tunes cartoons that something like this seems weak. Maybe they created this when they couldn't come up with any other ideas. Not terrible, but don't make it your first choice.",

Adopted by Dr. Jekyll, Bugs Bunny encounters the psychotic Mr. Hyde. Attempting to save himself and Jekyll, he gets into a confusing chase in which he can't understand how Hyde keeps breaking down his defences and where Jekyll keeps disappearing to. It's a one joke cartoon executed with no real pizazz and so it just becomes extremely repetitive. The character designs and backgrounds are awkward, angular and garish. Mr. Hyde is particularly disappointing as he represents a missed opportunity for a really creative and frightening design. Instead, he is just a slightly ugly green man with long, dragging hands. Freleng directed a better take on the Jekyll and Hyde story five years later with the Tweety and Sylvester short 'Hyde and Go Tweet', which worked better thanks to the two way chase between the characters. With no real motivation to do anything but escape, Bugs has very little to do here but panic and hide, panic and hide, again and again. The result is a cartoon that never even threatens to come alive right up until its predictable, half-hearted climax.",

                "text": "MYSTERY SUBMARINE 1950\n\nA rather strange Nazi's in South America mixed in with cold war monkey business film. The film is set several years after the end of World War Two. \n\nMacdonald Carey headlines this Douglas Sirk directed film with help from, Marta Toren, Robert Douglas, Carl Esmond and Ludwig Donath. Ex-German scientist, Ludwig, is vacationing on Cape Cod with his aide, Marta Toren. Toren is approached by a man while out walking the beach. The man calls her by name and says he is a friend of her husband. Marta finds this odd since her husband had been killed on a U-boat during the war. \n\nThe man, Carl Esmond, swears her husband is still alive, and wants her to join him. There is however something that Toren must do to help arrange this. Toren and Ludwig are having an outing the next day on a yacht. She is to sabotage the radio at a certain time. \n\nToren does the deed and soon there is a U-boat surfacing near the yacht. Esmond and several sailors in Nazi uniforms board the yacht. They grab up Toren and the scientist type, Ludwig. They are transferred to the submarine. Then the U-boat puts a torpedo into the yacht, sinking it. There are no survivors. \n\nMiss Toren now discovers that she has been duped. Her husband did die during the war. The whole thing was a plot by the Captain and crew of the renegade U-boat. They intend to sell Ludwig to the Soviets for a tidy sum. The U-boat sets sail for the northern coast of South America. The US Government is not amused that one of their scientists is gone. They investigate the ship's wreckage for clues. They soon put two and two together and get \"torpedo\". They even figure out that it was a German torpedo. \n\nMacdonald Carey, an ex-sub officer, a doctor, and a German speaker, is drafted in to help in the search for the missing Ludwig. Ludwig has a weak ticker and the U.S. would hate to have him die. The Americans, by the process of elimination, decide to hunt down South American way. \n\nCarey spends time in a small boat going up and down the various rivers and coves dotting the coast. Needless to say, he finds said sub hiding up one of the rivers. The Nazi guards soon have a grip on the man and hustle him to the Captain, Robert Douglas. It is a good thing Carey was given a cover as a former German Naval officer. And it so happens that the German do need some medical help. Ludwig is not coping well with confinement. \n\nCarey is soon at work on Ludwig and the man improves. He is let in on the plan to sell Ludwig and is offered a cut. Needless to say he accepts. Now he just needs to get a message to the US Navy. Needing more medicine the Nazi bunch pull a late night raid on a small hospital just up the coast. \n\nCarey tries to leave a message but it is discovered by Esmond. The Germans think about killing Carey, but concern over Ludwig's health stops them. A dead scientist brings no cash. Locked up with Toren, he gets the whole story from the woman. She will do anything to redeem herself. \n\nThe US Government types hear about the theft of the drugs. They are of course just the ones needed for Ludwig's heart problems. They send off a Navy anti-sub group, to have a look. They also have the area patrolled by aircraft. \n\nIt is now time for the U-boat to head for the meeting with the Red ship. The submarine is spotted and all US forces converge on it. The destroyers drop a few depth charges hoping to scare the German's to the surface. They do not want to kill Ludwig or Carey. The U-boat dives deep and it looks like they will get away, but, Toren manages to set off the emergency flares. These alert the Navy to the U-boat's new heading. \n\nA fresh round of depth charges damages the sub. The Germans pull the old gag of firing life savers, and other assorted items out a torpedo tube. This, and by the release of some fuel oil, they hope to fool the Americans. It seems to work as the attack stops. The German's renew their trip to the rendezvous with the Soviets. \n\nAt the meeting, all seems okay as the exchange is made. However, the German's have been hoodwinked. The US Navy is all over the ship. It seems that on one of the life preservers, Carey had written the rendezvous coordinates. The Navy had raced ahead and grabbed the Red ship, then, they just waited. With Ludwig, Toren and Carey safely on the ship, several Navy bombers put paid to the U-boat's account.\n\nThis is not one of director, Douglas Sirk's better films. Sirk, was another of the German film-makers who had fled Nazi Germany. He started off in Hollywood with several decent film-noir, \"Lured\", \"Shockproof\", \"Sleep my Love\". He would later score big in the later 1950's with films like, \"Written on the Wind\", \"All that Heaven Allows\", \"Magnificent Obsession\" and \"Imitation of Life\". \n\nThis one however just does not work, with poor writing and the actor's looking, \"all out to sea\". \n\nSwedish actress Mara Toren managed to pump out ten films during her five years in Hollywood. She would die at age 30 of a cerebral hemorrhage.",

Several scenes have a palpable noir atmosphere. Examples: when the kidnapping plot takes a sinister turn, Lovejoy covering his face with his hands in shame and horror; when the sad, lonely manicurist realizes she is in the company of a sought-after killer. Lovejoy's situation could not be more noir: it works so well, because of intelligent, convincing writing. We believe he is desperate for money and Bridges' offer seems almost irresistable. The actor expertly conveys his constant ambivalence about his new \"job\". Bridges demonstrates a gift for a realistic, malevolent transition, early on, when Lovejoy balks at pulling a robbery. He goes from shirtless, cocksure strutting to dandified indignancy in seconds, transmitting the resentment that so many criminals have for honest citizens.\n\nThe film does recall Fritz Lang's magnificent \"Fury\", and according to sources, both films were based on the same true incidents. And for all the greatness of the Lang opus, \"Try & Get Me\" holds its own as a depiction of the dark, downward spiral of a desperate man.  \n",

Then, the townsfolk, fueled by sensationalist journalism by the local paper, form into a huge lynch mob and storm the jail after the two criminals. The scenes of that, and what happens, are horrific. I am not exaggerating. In fact, it was one of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen on film, especially for a classic movie.

                "text": "Despite a catch-penny tile, \"Try and Get Me\" (aka Sound of Fury) remains a truly frightening movie whose disturbing imagery lingers long after the voice-over reassurances subside. The director, Cy Endfield, was one of the lower profile victims of the Mc Carthy purges. Viewing this movie now, it's easy to see why. \n\nFamily man and returning vet Howard Tyler (played by the always low-key Frank Lovejoy) is recruited into a life of crime by no more than ordinary desires for the American Dream. Desperate and unemployed, he falls into the clutches of a swaggering stickup man superbly played by a preening Lloyd Bridges. (Notice how subtly Bridges bends Tyler to his will on their first meeting at the bowling alley.) Joining Bridges, Tyler finally gets the standing he desires, but the spiral he has entered dooms him and his family's share of America's promise. (Note that conspicuous among the lynch mob's vanguard are fraternity boys, true to the actual event on which the movie is based.) \n\nThroughout, the lighting and photography effectively undermine the facile voice of reason that the producers probably felt obligated to include. Endfield may have wanted an anti- violence film, but the resulting visual landscape implies a world of endemic violence. A sense of powerlessness pervades the film, one that mere admonishments cannot overcome. As a result, the characters appear caught in some terrible metaphysical web from which there is no escape. Events march relentlessly on to a conclusion that remains one of the most harrowing in Hollywood history. This is film noir at its darkest and most frightening. \n\nSomething should be noted in passing about the compellingly exotic performance of Katherine Locke as Hazel the manicurist. Watch her facial expressions as this highly repressed plain-faced woman experiences yet one more rejection in what a paste-on smile shows to be a lifetime of rejections. Never has a blossom perched so precariously on a cheap hairdo conveyed as much lower-class longing as hers, while the car ride with a guilt-ridden Tyler could serve as tawdry inspiration for a dozen feminist tracts. What ever became of this unusual actress, I wonder. \n\nWithout doubt, however, the film's dramatic high point is the lynch mob. It's one of the most coldly unnerving 20 minutes in movie annals, far surpassing (in my view) the better-known Fury (1936) in its depiction of mass violence. The fact that the mob is made up of ordinary citizens brought to fever pitch is especially telling. Unthinking violence is thus shown as potentially present in us all. \n\nAt the same time, the screenplay refuses to take the easy way out. In fact, Howard and Jerry are guilty, unlike, say, the three unfortunate cowboys in The Oxbow Incident (1943). Thus, what repels us is not the fact that innocent men are killed for a crime they didn't commit. That would be too easy. Instead, I think we're unnerved by how the crowd appears to celebrate the brutality of vigilante justice. Endfield succeeds in making this aspect especially ugly. Yes, in a very general sense, justice is served\u0097murderers are in fact punished for their crime\u0097but if so, justice is served in a particularly barbaric way even if the act does have popular support. In my little book, Endfield has fashioned the most effective of all anti- lynching movies, in part because it doesn't take the easy way out.\n\nThat Endfield exiled himself to England and a conventional career with Stanley Baker, shows how much was lost among those purge victims whose disappearance, unlike many others, went generally unnoticed. Just a couple of years after the remarkable \"Try and Get Me\" (and Endfield's also provocative \"Underworld Story\"), Hollywood began sanitizing the screen with the escapism of period spectacles, Technicolor westerns, and full-cleavage sex goddesses. Indeed times had changed. As Endfield already knew, the studios had to fight the Cold War too. There would be no more thought-provoking Try and Get Me's.",

Struggling financially and upset that he can't support his family, he falls in with small time hoodlum Jerry Slocum (Lloyd Bridges) who convinces him to join him in robbing gas stations. However, things start to get out of control as they kidnap the son of a wealthy family to hold for ransom. But what follows will have far reaching consequences for all involved...\n\nAlso known as Try And Get Me, The Sound Of Fury is directed by Cy Endfield and is based on the novel The Condemned by Jo Pagano (who along with Endfield also writes the screenplay here). The story is incredibly based on a factual episode known as the Brooke Hart case that occurred in 1933 in San Jose, California. Fritz Lang's 1936 film Fury was also loosely based on the same story, which probably explains why Endfield's film had a name change to Try And Get Me.\n\nA brilliant crime thriller, the film is a damming indictment of uncontrolled violence in small town Americana. Its themes involving class divides, the uncivilization and ignorance of some Americans, moral and social collapse and the irresponsibility's of the press, are all rammed home with force by the soon to be blacklisted director. By definition, Endfield and Pagano have crafted the ultimate social conscious movie. Filling it with relevance that will last the ages, the undervalued Endfield also come up trumps in mood setting and visual flourishes. This be prime film noir too. Tumbling pebbles, a crime shown in reflection, our protagonist standing in the dark ruefully looking out a window, a complete night club sequence shot off kilter, all indelible images that linger long in the memory (Guy Roe on photography). Then there's the finale, a brutal and shocking ending that had Raymond Borde & Etienne Chaumenton (A Panorama Of American Film Noir 1941-1953) proclaiming it to be one of the most brutal sequences in postwar American cinema. They aren't exaggerating, it is, and it caps off a stunning movie.\n\nThere can be a reasonable argument put forward that the film asks for pity towards the hoodlums of the piece. But that's a confliction that serves as a call for a deeper thought process with the film. The makers are merely adding drips of fuel to an already incendiary device. Hugo Friedhofer provides the music and Kathleen Ryan, Richard Carlson & Katherine Locke fill out the support cast. However, this is Bridges' movie, Lovejoy is excellent as the increasingly fretful Tyler, but Bridges goes from smarm to charm with ease and then to crazy psychotic in the blink of an eye, an unnerving character given the treatment by the big man. Still awaiting a DVD release, any chance you get to see this film you should grab with both hands. Powerful, intelligent stuff. 9/10",

It's not long though before Bridges' true character comes to light, escalating in no time to a kidnapping and brutal murder with disastrous outcomes for all concerned.\n\nFor its time, this is all pretty heady stuff, shown to us in matter of fact style by director Endfield with to my mind anyway, little real deference to noir conventions. The film is a bit slow to get started but once Bridges appears, it picks up on his manic energy. Some of the peripheral characters are just a bit too obvious, like the humanist professor friend of the sensationalist journalist whose screaming headlines, the film would have it, egg the local townsfolk to storming the jail while said journalist's own realisation of his part in the mayhem is also a little laboured but these are counteracted in some measure by some effective low-key character acting by Lovejoy and Katherine Locke as the lovelorn girl with whom Bridges sets him up for alibi purposes.\n\nThe concluding riot scene, (with it seems a lot of university students to the fore!) gets the biggest budget and is effectively staged, reminiscent of its predecessor in Lang's classic \"Fury\", before the big downbeat message is double-underlined for us as the credits roll.\n\nA very watchable and considering its era, bold movie with interesting characters, dealing with big subjects and ending with a thundering moral message to boot.

Bridges offers Lovejoy a job as his wheel man. Just a couple of minor stick-ups, nothing serious. But the robberies escalate into the kidnapping of a college boy from a rich family. Bridges, an envious psychopath, kills the kid out of spite. Both Bridges and Lovejoy are caught and jailed but several thousand people break into the jail, beat the men, and pass them outside overhead like serving platters where they meet vigilante justice.\n\nI haven't seen it since I was a kid but the memory of that climactic collective murder still makes me wince.\n\nIt's impossible to comment on the performances, or on much else for that matter, after the passage of so many years but unless my brain has turned to tofu, I'm compelled to recommend the film. I remember Lovejoy as being a little stiff but Lloyd Bridges giving a dead imitation of a caged animal. Kathleen Ryan was winsome. And there is a touching portrait of a desperately lonely lady who hooks up with Lovejoy.\n\nIt was made at the height of the anti-Red hysteria in Hollywood, a time when subliminal pro-communist messages were being read into cinematic trifles.

Down on his luck, Howard is hanging out in a bowling lane when he meets the charismatic and generous Jerry Slocum. Slocum offers him a job that will pay really well and Howard gratefully accepts. When he learns that he is the driver in the robbery of a grocery store, he has misgivings but none that cannot be drowned out by the relief of having plenty of money in his pocket for the first time in years. However one thing leads to another and it is not long before Howard finds himself exceeding what he is willing to accept being part of but yet unable to get out.\n\nA late night \"noir\" double bill on channel 4 caused me to stumble across this film despite never having heard of it before. Although not strictly a noir, the film is an effective drama that does rely on the \"normal\" guy drawn into a destructive world of crime. The plot offers lots of potential in the dark content and is still good even if it doesn't really deliver on it. The narrative focuses on Howard's descent and I was surprised by morally quite how simplistic it all was. Howard's inability to deal with what he does is straightforward and the clear fate served him by the script is also quite easy. The media plays a part in the shape of journalist Gil Stanton and I hoped this would produce something of real insight but mostly he and other characters seem to exist to vocalise the moralising part of the script. They do make more of it towards the end but I wanted more in the way of consistency.\n\nThe moralising and simplicity across the film does rather make for a weaker second half but the \"descent\" is by far the best part of the film. In terms of delivery it offers more dramatic scenes but this also means more meat for the actors to work with. Lovejoy's desperation but yet conflict is written across his performance and at its best is pretty good. Unfortunately for him, he is totally in the shadow of a really enjoyable turn from Lloyd Bridges. Bridges is cool, arrogant, angry, slick, vain, violent and unpredictable and he is easily the most memorable part of the film. Inexplicable then that the script lets him disappear for the vast majority of the second half of the film \u0096 his absence is felt. Carlson tries to be the heart of the later debate but he cannot do it and comes over quite insincere and simplistic. Ryan, Locke, Jergens and others are so-so.\n\nOverall then this is an interesting moral drama that has plenty of good moments in the first half and plenty of potential in the second half's moralising. Bridges and Lovejoy deliver well in the first half. While it is a real shame that the second half feels weak, simplistic and no where near as intelligent and challenging as I wanted it to be, it is still pretty dark and interesting for the period and should be recognised for that.",

Out of work family man Frank Lovejoy gets involved in small time stick-ups with sociopath narcissist, Lloyd Bridges (yes, the Sea Diver star). Eventually, they progress to kidnapping. Bridges' true character comes out and leads to murder. Lovejoy's family man breaks down, drinks heavily and confesses his duplicity to a woman he has picked up. She goes to the police and the two are arrested. A local scandal sheet starts whipping the community into a frenzy, an announcer actually calls for a lynching on the radio and soon a mob takes out Lovejoy and Bridges as they await trial. That's it -- and that last scene is absolutely terrifying. This was a courageous movie to make at the height of the McCarthy era (1950). The story was inspired by a 1933 lynching in San Jose of two kidnapping suspects; a murder by mob that was actually condoned by then Calif. Gov. James Rolph. The movie conveys a real ambiance of poverty and grittiness beyond the typical film noir posturings of the era. Lovejoy and Bridges are at their best. The Lovejoy character is sympathetic and fragile while the Bridges character is a true predator. And dig the weird narcissism and almost gay vibe that Bridges gives off when he poses in the mirror for Lovejoy at their first meeting. Director Cy Enfield was gray-listed and split for the UK where he did the great Hell Drivers (1957) and Zulu (1964).

Defoe's story of an emissary of white, Christian civilisation suddenly alone in the universe and having to fend for himself, is a wonderful metaphor from which to explore the human condition and spirit, thrust into a world in which, if there is a God, he is seemingly powerless to help or intervene.\n\nAs Crusoe returns to his roots, he becomes more and more at one with Nature and his own nature, until the yearned for contact with a fellow human being, provokes fear and terror when it appears likely to happen. But, although his own fear means that his initial treatment of Friday is harsh and cruel, the enslavement of a fellow human being enables Crusoe to see how depraving and corrupting such vile practices are, and eventually he and Friday become friends and comrades, but only when Crusoe realises he must give Friday total and unconditional freedom.\n\nThe film contains some of Bunuel's most potent cinema: the feverish dream sequence where Crusoe's father chides him for his adventurous, and, therefore, \"wayward\" spirit; the scene where he is so desperate to hear another human voice he goes to the Valley of the Echo and shouts a Psalm, and then walks in despair into the sea until his torch is extinguished by the waves; and the final scene where, leaving the island at last with Friday, he looks back for the last time, and hears the ghostly echo of his faithful, but long since dead dog, Rex, barking...\n\nShot in Path\u00e9color, some of the scenes are beautiful, whilst others could be improved upon, but the sheer drama and intellectual engagement it provides overcome such minor technical faults, and the whole is wonderfully enhanced by a first-rate score by Anthony Collins and Luis Breton. Dan O'Herlihy as Crusoe carries the entire film, and was quite rightly nominated as \"Best Actor\" for this role at the 1954 Academy Awards. It is perhaps Bunuel at his most laid-back and subtle, but, believe me, watched in the right frame of mind, (which means forgetting all your preconceptions about the well-known story), it packs as much punch as any of his films.

He retrieves the dog Rex and the cat Sam, together with some supplies, weapons, clothes and tools from the shipwreck; builds a shelter; and learns how to survive, cooking, farming, harvesting the crop and gathering a cattle. Then the loneliness disturbs him, especially after the loss of Rex. When he sees a group of cannibals in the island, tension and fear become part of his life. Later he saves the life of a savage that was going to be eaten by the cannibals; he names him Friday (Jaime Fern\u00e1ndez) and they become friends. When Robinson Crusoe sees Caucasians in the island, he finds that Captain Oberzo (Felipe de Alba) was the victim of a mutiny and he helps him to retrieve his ship. After twenty-eight years, two months and nineteen days, Robinson Crusoe leaves the island to return to the civilization. \n\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" was my favorite novel in my childhood and I do not know how many times I have read this book. Luis Bu\u00f1uel, who is one of my favorite directors, makes a faithful transposition of this timeless story of survival, loneliness, fear and friendship to the cinema. This is probably the first conventional movie of Bu\u00f1uel that I have ever seen and his usual surrealism is limited to the sickness and daydream of Robinson Crusoe.

In other words, the fact that this is a relatively straight retelling of the classic Daniel Defoe story may be held against it. There are no eyes being cut with razors, no devil coming to tempt Robinson nor is there any sexual chemistry between him and Friday--all touches you might expect from Bu\u00f1uel.

                "text": "In maybe his only time of giving into a commercial project, Luis Bunuel, deliciously notorious surrealist and satirist, took off his usual run of Mexican-produced films of the decade and adapted The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. On the surface, if one weren't familiar with the director's works at all, it has the seeming quality of being an average B-movie adventure of a man in solitude who is saved by his man Friday and his own resourcefulness. The story of the cast away has ended up having better days, specifically in Zemeckis's Cast Away, as far as with how the actual details of the story unfurl. It boils down to this: Crusoe gets shipwrecked on an island, takes what he can from the ship (some supplies, actually lots, a few animals), builds a camp, and little by little after the novelty of a deserted island wears off he goes near mad in loneliness. That is until the cannibals arrive, dropping off a man whom Robinson names Friday and quasi-domesticates as his servant-cum-friend. This is a story that even school-children know, and has even appeared as a goof on a Peabody & Sherman cartoon.\n\nBut the fun in watching this rendition of Crusoe is for fans of the director to see what he does with the material. It's not a perfect affair, truth be told, as Bunuel isn't the greatest director of suspense, particularly in the climax. But what is essential for a film with as basic a plot as this to have is an understanding of what can be subverted, lightly and slightly twisted into personal expression. This is nothing new for many of today's famous filmmakers ala Spielberg or Scorsese, but for Bunuel he approaches it in ways that his best fans will be keen to look for and get in nice quantities. For example, as he is known more often than not as a director of dreams (his best film, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, has dreams within dreams in savagely playful fashion), we see Crusoe having a dream early on where there's soft gel on the sides of the screen (maybe to appease the producers, who knows), and in it Crusoe dreams of his father pouring sauce or other on a pig, and images of Crusoe in water, cut together and acted in truly classic style. It's probably even one of his better dream sequences, followed up by another later on that features a pretty funny image to boot.\n\nActually, part of what makes Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe so enjoyable is spotting the references to past films- his palm covered with some bugs speaks right away cheerfully to Un Chien Andalou- as well as just mildly absurd usages of animals on screen (how did the cat have kittens?), and even Christian imagery in simply showing Crusoe with his huge beard, which Dan O'Hearlihy sports proudly for most of the film, and even carrying what looks like a cross (!) but turns out to be the stand for a scarecrow. Then there's also the aspect to the bond between Crusoe and Friday, which is almost a pop-art form of one of Bunuel's own treatises on the division of the classes in many of his films (i.e. Viridiana and Exterminating Angel). In a way it works just as well as a simple story anyway, because Bunuel is able to have his cake and eat it, by having a tale that as stilted it might be in its not-quite-high-or-low budget and form of writing/narration at times is fairly gripping in an 'old-school' way, as well as enough room to bring out his flashes of brilliant imagery and jabs of surrealism, and even absurdism.",

                "text": "Stories about castaways and isolation are usually pretty tough going. Tom Hanks' movie was very slow at times. Even when there are two characters instead of just one, and even when the characters are Toshiro Mifune and Lee Marvin in \"Hell in the Pacific,\" there are likely to be longueurs. And it's no wonder that no one has done movie called \"Walden Pond\" -- \"First I adzed this, then I adzed that.\" \n\nI've never read Defoe's novel but the movie seems to stick closely to the original, with the elisions necessary in converting a long and episodic novel to a screenplay. The spoken narration helps. In the film, Crusoe gets only two pet animals, a dog, Rex, and a cat, instead of two cats. The single cat in the movie provides the occasion for a joke when she gives birth to a litter of kitten -- \"Where did you find the father?\" Crusoe is stuck on this Caribbean island for twenty-eight years and I can say seriously that when Rex the dog dies of old age, I've never felt sadder for the death of a fictional dog.\n\nI'm going to mostly skip the story. Crusoe almost goes mad with loneliness and when he runs across his native man, Friday, he doesn't derive much comfort from his devoted companion. He and Friday finally make a successful escape from the island.\n\nCrusoe is Daniel O'Herlihy, whom I admired a great deal in \"Odd Man Out,\" in which he's a nervous and not particularly bright terrorist in Belfast, and he was fine as a reserved liar in \"Home Before Dark.\" He was nominated or an Oscar for his performance here but he seems strictly functional to me. None of the other performances amount to much. \n\nBut -- Luis Bunuel, when he was still in his prime? It seems directed by an amateur. When Crusoe gets drunk to celebrate his fifth anniversary of isolation, the periphery of the screen is blurred. Even the absence of expected clich\u00e9s -- there are no sweeping vistas of the tropical beach -- seem to have been forgotten rather than deliberately avoided. When Crusoe resorts to reading the Bible, I half expected God to appear and tweak Crusoe's nose.\n\nBut, for all that, it's a gripping movie, easy to be swept into. Ontogeny repeats phylogeny. We watch an ordinary man, who has rescued only one or two small rafts of supplies, reenact the history of Homo sapiens. He learns how to make fire. He learns to domesticate animals and then he domesticates plants like wheat. He learns the art of self protection. He first embraces, then rejects the idea of having a slave, settling for having a willing servant. He finds comfort in the Bible. He discovers that currency is meaningless on the island but it saves his bacon in the end. The last we see of Robinson Crusoe, in 1686, he's dressed in colonial finery and is setting off for England, a wealthy man with his \"servant\".\n\nDefoe was a Puritan. I don't know what he was getting at in this story, if in fact he was getting at anything. But, though the movie looks cheap and easy, it ought to keep a viewer interested enough to follow it through to the end.",

This is one of the more well known, but even then, it isn't that famous. This is really a shame, because I personally found this to be a great underrated movie. I have read the original book version and loved it. It is kind of sad how I really don't read novels anymore and I don't remember that much from the actual book. What I do know is that this was a very faithful retelling. I think the main alluring of the story in general is how it gives a realistic interpretation of being trapped on an island. It's interesting just to hear and read about how he has to make his crops to survive.

Around six months later I watched Luis Bu\u00f1uel's 1954 adaptation, starring Dan O'Herlihy in the title role, and this has redeemed 'Robinson Crusoe' for me. The parts of the novel that I didn't enjoy largely sat in the middle, where Crusoe is in the process of upgrading his settlement, practising animal husbandry and performing other chores. Bu\u00f1uel mercifully condenses such elements, and the result is a more coherent (and therefore enjoyable) narrative. Like in the novel, some of the best scenes in this film occur after Crusoe has met Friday, and I'd say that the second half is somewhat stronger than the first. However, I never grew bored of this adaptation; given its constraints, I believe that a 90-minute runtime is perfect for the story. The handful of actors comprising the cast for this film are also fairly good, and a perceptive viewer will see O'Herlihy's performance improve as the film progresses.

                "text": "Luis Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe (1954) is a classic example of the auteur film in its initial sense: the director's vision and style emerge from the tension with the conventional materials assigned him. Later he would make more freeform films with a more blatant style that transcended the term \"auteur.\"\n\nBunuel was among three hands scripting the famous novel, which was too famous to highjack. It's Bunuelian in smaller touches.\n\nHis Crusoe exhibits many of the discreet charms of the bourgeoisie. Obviously he's ingenious, clever, perseverant, what a man who survives 28 years on a jungle island would be. But Bunuel takes his liberties. That pottery wheel seems a Magrittean incongruity. The scale of the hero's little world seems too impressive, too grand a reward for the Protestant work ethic to be credible.When Crusoe is ultimately rescued he returns to the image of the bourgeoisie, neatly coiffed, elegantly dressed and perfumed, a lord worthy any manner and manners.\n\nWhen Crusoe leaves the later mutineers to maintain his legacy he envies them for possessing what he lacked: companionship. But those surlies promise about as much community and collaboration as the beggars of Viridiana.\n\nAs Defoe describes, when Crusoe accrues his man Friday he un-christianly reduces him from person to weekday and makes himself his Master. He discourages the grovel but encourages frightened awe \u0097 and total obedience. After overcoming his own fears of Friday's cannibalism and desire to escape Crusoe comes to trust him with the weapons, gives him full training and ultimately gives him the rewards of smoking. He will take him in full livery to the English jungle, society. Here Crusoe is the model of the European slave keeper.\n\nBunuel's spiirit gleams in the religion scenes. Crusoe has learned to recite his rote faith well, but flounders when he tries to explain it to Friday. Bunuel gives the pagan (aka uncontaminated) Friday an impish rational skepticism that Crusoe can't handle, only feel superior in dismissing.Turning to his parrot for agreement betrays Crusoe as a reciter of unabsorbed rote, unable to respond to basic questions. Unburdened by the cant, Friday can plainly ask: If God keeps Satan alive to tempt man why does he punish man for sinning? \n\nIn an earlier scene Crusoe goes off to his echo vale for the delusion of company, when he cries out to himself and receives his echo. In choosing a Psalm what Crusoe shouts and yearns to hear is a confirmation of his faith, of the existence of his God, renewal of his soul. What he gets is a hollow taunt of himself. Choosing the psalm makes his need for religious support, which the empty echoes can't feel. Crying for soul renewal he strides forward to fill the screen with his strictly material presence, his soul unswelled.\n\nWhether or not in Defoe, Bunuel allows his island an immaculate conception. Where Crusoe's cat found a lover is never known but her litter embodies the fertility and mystery with which the natural wilds outruns our logic and pragmatism. \n\nTwice Bunuel gives Crusoe the discomfit of erotic stirrings. The first is when he sees a dress blowing on his scarecrow. The second \u0097 more angrily suppressed \u0097 is when Friday dons a dress and gold necklace and plays at war. The is Bunuel's delight in tweaking sexual repression rather than DeFoe's. It's Defoe's classic novel but Bunuel's most promising early film.",

Crusoe's relationship with his parents, his decision and yearning for the high seas, his toiling as a slave himself to a Muslim master (and eventual escape), and his purchase of a plantation in the Brazils all preceded his one great adventure. The film blasts through all this in a quick minute or less! I guess that is understandable...it isn't easy to tell a 350 page novel in such detail in just 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to the short biography on the DVD we read, the director Bu\u00f1uel was hostile to religion...perhaps he was \"smothered\" with it in childhood. This may explain the omission of much (but not all) of the spiritual aspects Defoe had throughout the book.\n\nDefoe's character struggles with ungratefulness to God, then re-discovers how blessed he is in his life despite the problems of loneliness and despair. Truly, the novel is inspirational for anyone who faces these fears (and who doesn't?) Defoe's hero isn't a mere spiritual wanderer, though--he works and works hard for his sustenance....the island is a bit of \"Eden\" that Crusoe must work. This movie avoids a lot of this struggle.\n\nBu\u00f1uel took out much of the spirituality of the book instead, he added a deep friendship Crusoe has with his dog \"Rex\". The subplot of Crusoe's attachment to the dog is an important way the director shows the character's need for friendship.\n\nThe 1954 film does a good job in the more \"physical\" aspects of the story. O'Herlihy is a fine Robinson, changing his look as time goes on. And his eventual befriending of the savage whom he names \"Friday\" is an interesting turning point. Crusoe craves friendship--but he also is suspicious of his new companion.\n\nThe \"adventure\" portion of the film is interesting and well-done even for a film shot 50+ years ago. Crusoe's building of his home, his survival in the hostile environment, and his hard work of husbandry and farming are shown with good faithfulness to the book. Especially endearing is the scene where Crusoe eats his first hot, fresh baked \"bread\" in several years...bread he has just made.\n\nCrusoe is a man of integrity and eventually helps save the captain of a ship whose crew is engaging in mutiny...he and Friday do a good job of assisting the stranded captain. He even extends a kind gesture to the mutineers--instead of taking them back to civilization to be hanged, he leaves them on the island with detailed instructions on how to survive...as he did for 28+ years.\n\nOverall, a pretty decent adaptation of the book...BUT...what Daniel Defoe's novel truly awaits is for a detailed telling of the story (perhaps in a miniseries) that shows Robinson as a young man--rejecting his father's sage advice--and going through the various struggles detailed in the book...before he is rescued to tell his tale of survival.",

He has very little help in doing so.\n\nDan O'Herlihy who was a fine character actor and never had any great pretense for anything else stars in this adaption of Daniel DeFoe's classic novel from the 18th century. O'Herlihy earned himself a Best Actor Oscar nomination though he had a great career, never got that kind of acclaim for anything he did. I recall him saying that he was happy just to be nominated, he never expected a victory. \n\nAs a story Robinson Crusoe exists on two levels. First there is the struggle just for physical survival where he can expect no help. DeFoe narrates in the novel and on screen O'Herlihy has good instincts in that direction in making shelter for himself and in gathering food.\n\nThe second level is the introspective one. The character of Crusoe is a typical English Puritan of the 17th century with very fixed ideas about morality. But you spend almost 30 years without the company of anyone to reinforce those ideas you do a lot of self analysis. Especially after he saves the man he later names Friday who is a cannibal about to be eaten by another tribe of them. Friday is played by Mexican film star Jaime Fernandez and the scenes between O'Herlihy and Fernandez are warm, affectionate, and touching.\n\nNice color cinematography also distinguishes this version of Robinson Crusoe.

                "text": "A surprisingly straightforward adaptation of Defoe's classic novel from cinema's master of the surreal, The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is firstly in need of a spruce up as the print I saw was blurry to the point of distraction.\n\nJourneyman actor Dan O'Herlihy in the role of Crusoe is naturally called upon to carry the film and he pretty much delivers the kind of performance you'd expect a journeyman actor to deliver; bland, unremarkable but inoffensive. He sucks in his tummy so that his rib cage juts out like the prow of a boat, while his louche character shows a surprising aptitude for survival given that he never engaged in any kind of physical labour prior to his calamitous voyage \u0096 which, Bunuel suggests, was undertaken with the object of securing slaves for sale back in the homeland.\n\nSome of the scenery, filmed presumably on the Mexican coastline, is breathtaking (even if it is blurry), and provides an engaging diversion when the film plods, which it does for much of the time. We see Crusoe salvaging materials from the wreckage of the ill-fated ship, building a shelter, fetching water, puzzling over how the island's sole cat managed to get herself pregnant, baking bread, getting drunk and a little teary-eyed. It's all a little hum-drum to be honest (although the scene where Crusoe, in the grip of loneliness, shouts into a valley just to hear a human voice \u0096 his own \u0096 speak back to him, is a memorable moment), but things do at least pick up a bit when Man Friday washes up on the coast, intended as the main course of the cannibals who live on the neighbouring island (who obviously felt like grabbing a takeaway to eat out that day).\n\nThis being a Bunuel film, there's obviously stuff going on under the surface, much of it to do with the nature of Crusoe's relationship with \u0096 and eventual questioning of \u0096 God, and for what purpose he has been set down on a godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere; a sexual undercurrent is also present \u0096 let's face it, after 28 years it would be unnatural if it wasn't \u0096 Crusoe dresses his scarecrow in a woman's dress and then longingly fondles its hem and then, when Friday innocently dons it as a hunting garb, staunchly resists the homo-erotic temptation that is (rather timidly \u0096 this is the fifties, after all) thrown in his path. And, this being a Bunuel film, we are of course treated to a somewhat surreal hallucination sequence suffered by Crusoe as he lies sick in his shelter.\n\nMore an interesting curio than a work of much worth, it's a film that's worth watching simply for its rarity value.",

I saw this movie at the age of 12 when it first came out at the local movie house. At the time I recall thinking about how fascinating life on an uninhabited island could be and about the loneliness RC must have felt most of the time. Now I can add some of my own recent comments and observations.\n\nIt aired on TCM the other morning and saw it in a somewhat different light. The book must have contained many passages of mental soliloquy, contemplation and introspection. Such a cerebral book must have been difficult to transfer to the screen, and RC's overarching feeling of boredom can extend off-screen to the audience. The film is part documentary and part travelogue with a great deal of voice-over narration, and moments of genuine excitement are few and far between.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned a sexual angle - or lack thereof - but I think I found two latent instances. In the scene where RC puts up a scarecrow to protect his wheat crop, he puts a woman's dress on it, walks away and looks back at a distance, then walks away slump-shouldered, perhaps thinking of female acquaintances past. In the second, Friday finds a woman's dress, puts it on and jumps about for RC's benefit. RC angrily tells him to take it off, perhaps trying to stave off a southern hemisphere version of Greenwich village.\n\nAll things considered, this movie is the best that could be done, given the limitations of the narrative. In short, I liked it better when I was 12, before the onset of cognitive reasoning.",

                "text": "It's been a very long time since I read Daniel Defoe's novel \"Robinson Crusoe,\" so a good deal of the story matter in the movie seemed relatively fresh to me, although from what I do remember of it the movie is a pretty good adaptation of the novel. It revolves around the most obvious theme of loneliness, as Crusoe deals with life on this deserted island, with only a dog and a cat who also survived the shipwreck as his companions. As such, the movie has every now and then some spiritual reflections (not surprising, since Defoe himself was a Christian and a religious \"dissenter\") as Crusoe also finds himself having to make peace with God. For the most part all that was well portrayed by Daniel O'Herlihy, who for the majority of the movie is putting on a one man show.\n\nOne thing that I thought was lacking in this, though (and it's a significant weakness) is any real sense of emotion. Much of the story of Crusoe's time alone on the island is told by a rather cold narration of Defoe's writing, and that basically matched the overall emotional feel of the movie. It was well filmed, and it did a decent enough job of portraying Crusoe's struggles and adjustments, but O'Herlihy never really drew me in to the character and never gave me any feel for him. To be perfectly honest, the only real sense of emotion I got from this revolved around Rex, the dog - his death and the last shots of the film. I admit that as Crusoe walked toward the boat that would finally rescue him I thought \"aren't you even going to go to Rex's grave to say good bye?\" So the last shot (of Crusoe looking back at the island from the boat and hearing Rex's bark) hit a bit of a nerve with me.\n\nOtherwise, it's a technically well made movie; just surprisingly lacking in real feeling.

I've got to say that this film left me pretty cold from start to finish and this is the first time I've been left extremely disappointed in Bunuel. I guess it goes without saying that this isn't the typical kind of films we'd see from him but I think he could have handled the material a tad bit better. My biggest problem is that I never got caught up in the story, the character or any of the situations going on. I found the film to be very distant when it should have been more involving and compelling. The film does feature some very good cinematography, which is a major plus with all the locations. Another bonus is the performance by O'Herlihy who manges to be very good in his one man show. The scene with him and the dying dog was very touching and handled well. The feverish dream sequence with Robinson's father was also well done but these type of scenes were the exception and not the rule.",

Most of the film tells you what the castaway has done rather than shows you until Friday and the cannibals arrive. It briefly perks up here, dealing well with Crusoe's patronising relationship with Friday and their initial distrust, but it's still just skirting the moderately interesting rather than the genuinely engaging. Daniel O'Herlihy's one note performance is a liability too \u0096 there's not much to this Crusoe, and certainly not enough to spend 90 minutes with him.\n\nTrue, the film was made under immensely difficult conditions, but my problem was that only the limitations were visible - in the restored 90-minute version I saw there was precious little imagination or ability either, which I found particularly surprising from Bunuel: a flat and lifeless b-movie programmer was the last thing I would have expected from him. This felt more like one of Louis Heyward's worst efforts, only without the sporadic entertainment value. Only the fate of Crusoe's dog and the sound of its bark as he left the island really resonated.\n\nAside from a surprisingly inept dream sequence and a brief theological discussion, there's little to show that this is a Bunuel film (at times its perilously close to Ed Wood's print the first take approach, being shot almost entirely in bland tight medium shots), marking it as a failure as a Bunuel film, a literary adaptation and an adventure. A shame.\n\nThe VCi R1 DVD of the 90-minute version is an impressive package, offering both Spanish and English language tracks and a long audio interview with O'Herlihy.",

                "text": "Adapting a book to a film is a difficult task. Not only must you get the characters right, but a director, or screenwriter, must drive deep within the mindset of the author. There are inside, as well as outside elements that must be considered. What was going through the character's mind? What was the time period like? What level of realism can we bring to the silver screen while still packing the theater seats? All of these are challenges that everyone associated with the film must grasp before committing to a project \u0096 which is why it is so rare to discover someone claiming the film was better than the book. It just is rare to discover the two in a blissful marriage. That is why there was hesitation with Bunuel's 1952 adaptation of Daniel Defoe's literary classic. Knowing what was going to be coming in the future, \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" or \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" or even \"The Milky Way\", one could safely wager your entire salary on this early film. I wanted amateur, I wanted independent, I wanted to see where Bunuel found his inspiration \u0096 but alas, none could be found with this bomb of an adaptation. \n\nWe are all familiar with the truth that Bunuel's was in exile from Spain, living in an unfamiliar world, facing the tough face of McCarthyism around every angle. So, why not make a film about a man, in essence, dealing with similar feelings. It is not uncommon for directors to take projects that they feel a connection towards, so Bunuel grabbed at the opportunity. Coupled with the fact that Bunuel had both the honor of making his first film in English as well as color, \"Robinson Crusoe\" should have been a staple in modern cinema. It could have ranked up there next to any of Godard's work \u0096 but it didn't. It garnished one Oscar nominee (for best actor), and then couldn't even find distribution for DVD until recently. Why such difficulty for such a pioneering film for Bunuel? This isn't a fantastic film. This is poorly directed, jokingly acted, and horribly misleading to anyone enjoying the works of Defoe. O'Herlihy is impossible as Crusoe, never giving us anything to believe or trust. As the island slowly becomes a luxury destination instead of a place of abandonment, as our hopes of seeing any decent cinema from this pathetic epic disappears as well. Bunuel did happen to place a couple of great scenes in this film, but they are scattered few and far between. Needless to say, in the cannon of Bunuel films, \"Robinson Crusoe\" ranks near the bottom.\n\nOur story itself is the main root of the issues. From the beginning crash, the cheapish cinematography demonstrating the power of the sea (possibly made by school children), all the way to the \"grand\" finale, one never feels that sense of danger \u0096 or chaos. Taking this film away from the story, meeting Crusoe for the first time, Bunuel gives us nothing. There are no scenes in which Crusoe has to learn, where he has to survive \u0096 in the first twenty minutes he is found sleeping in a tree then immediately building a well fortified hut around a cave \u0096 within forty minute he has bread and some random length of time has passed. Butler's adaptation fails because there is no sense of danger \u0096 I never felt worried that Crusoe was going to survive \u0096 because he never went without. Sure, there were scenes of sickness and hunger \u0096 but they were just never that impending. Perhaps it was the close tight shots that plagued the opening of this film, or the bland colors \u0096 but the initial puzzle pieces never fit.\n\nNever looking weak, never getting skinny, never finding anything except his deepened voice \u0096 Crusoe seemed more concerned about not being a man than staying alive (i.e. see the excessive beard growth). How could a man trying to survive in the wilderness, scream out to the mountains? More focus on Crusoe, his life, his personality, would have strengthened these dampening scenes. That said, Bunuel did attempt on a couple of occasions to spruce up what he could to the lackluster story. The scene in which Crusoe gets drunk (as there is an endless supply of booze on the island) and thinks that he sees his friends is phenomenal. It was brilliant to have the camera as tight as it was, hearing the ghostly voices speak to him, then, just as the cup falls \u0096 it all ends \u0096 and we are thrust back into the truth of the island. Wow. It was just as breathtaking again \u0096 but there aren't many of these gems in which Bunuel can demonstrate his talent. Instead, it felt like he worked for Disney on this project. Even the introduction of Friday seemed cheapened by the fact that within ten minutes he was speaking English or being shackled. I realize that it was the time, but if I were trapped on an island for that many years, would I make the only other living person a slave? Keeping his close as to not lose that sense of friendship is one thing; racism is a whole new bag.\n\nOverall, \"The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" is a very disappointing film. The acting is laughable, the story feels like a kiddy ride at Disney (coupled with all the food that you can eat), and the cinematography is amateurish. For a story that has been done time and time again (you can even see it weekly on \"Lost\"), there was just a lacking element of danger, chaos, and survival. As mentioned before, there was no built sensation that Crusoe was never going to make it (whether you knew the story or not), it just seemed like this island has all the luxuries he wanted. \n\nGrade: * \u00bd out of *****",

On the trail Ladd pulls a Fletcher Christian number on him and the men follow Ladd.\n\nThere's also a subplot involving a United States marshal seeking extradition for Shelley Winters who is wanted for murder in the USA. They're along on the trail of mutiny as well.\n\nGiven those facts it's no wonder that Canadian audiences to this day apparently don't receive Saskatchewan well. A pity because Raoul Walsh, one of the best action directors ever, does well in that department with the ridiculous story. Ladd's as intrepid a Mountie as ever this side of Nelson Eddy and Winters essentially repeats her character from Winchester 73.\n\nIn the supporting cast is J. Carrol Naish who plays the Metis scout for the Mounties who apparently every time he turns his wife is birthing another child. It's his performance I enjoy best about Saskatchewan.",

                "text": "I would have to agree with most of the other posters, who give this film mixed reviews. The scenery is fantastic, the action is compelling, and there are a number of good actors on hand. But the historical inaccuracies, concerning things like the Mounties' costumes, and the actions of the post-Custer (Last Stand) Sioux, do detract from the film. Raoul Walsh is one of my favorite old-time directors, but he made his share of films which deviate from the truth. After all, he did direct the Errol Flynn version of Custer, \"They Died With Their Boots On,\" which must be one of the most fanciful historical films ever. Walsh wasn't (and isn't) alone in this casual disregard for the truth, by any means. Everyone knows that there is history, and there is movie history. And plenty of other directors took as many liberties with the truth. The great John Ford, for instance. For example, the shoot-out at the OK Corral was nothing like that portrayed in \"My Darling Clementine\" (great film though it is). And the fact that Monument Valley creeps into so many of his westerns, some of which are taking place far from that photogenic area, isn't accuracy at work. Artistic license, and making a good movie, have often taken precedence in this regard. \n\nOne Walsh movie which does seem more true-to-life is \"The Big Trail,\" his ground-breaking 1930 film with John Wayne. Historians could no doubt find some mistakes in the film, but it seems fairly realistic as regards a covered wagon trek. Maybe the lesson is that historical fiction is often best, as inconvenient facts can't get in your way. And classic Hollywood directors had no monopoly on putting myth before truth. Look at contemporary directors like Oliver Stone and Michael Bay, who put the older Hollywood folks to shame. Stone, in particular, takes almost psychedelic flights of fancy in his films, and any relation to true events seems very tenuous. As many have pointed out, John Ford addressed this issue of myth-making versus truth-telling, in his film \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\" It should come as no surprise that the myth often wins out. And even when true stories are told fairly accurately, as in \"Glory,\" small liberties are taken with things like contemporary language, and events are often compressed or moved around. A classic movie like \"The Great Escape,\" while basically telling a true story, fictionalized large aspects of it (not many, or any, Americans involved; it's the wrong season, etc.), something that no doubt irritated the men who were really there. Another great prison camp movie, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\" was guilty of the same things.\n\nAnyway, Raoul wasn't immune to any of that, as this film clearly shows. If one looks at it as pure fiction, and if one buys the scenes of Mounties trying to be inconspicuous, in the woods, while wearing bright red uniforms, it's a pretty entertaining movie. Those more knowledgeable than I can point out the geographical and historical errors in this film. I'm sure that anyone with proximity to Saskatchewan can find many things to chuckle over.\n\nIn 1945, Alan Ladd played the title role in a film called \"Salty O'Rourke,\" directed by Raoul Walsh. Ladd's character's name in this film is O'Rourke, too. An in-joke, perhaps? It does seem like more than coincidence, considering that the two men didn't work together often. Also, does the plot remind anyone of other Walsh \"chase\" films, like \"Objective Burma,\" and \"Distant Drums,\" where army units are being pursued through hostile terrain, often by an unseen enemy (in this film, the pursuers are shown very clearly)? A nail-biting plot, but one which does get repetitive. Also, what's with the jungle bird sounds that the Sioux make? Not your usual Canadian bird calls.",

                "text": "Viewers will enjoy the staggering beauty of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in this no-nonsense, fast-paced, colorful story of a patrol of scarlet-coated Mounties guiding a diverse group of passengers over a perilous mountain pass while pursued and constantly noodged by Indians. The movie should have been called \"Alberta\" instead of \"Saskatchewan,\" since Alberta is the province where shooting took place. But I suppose \"Alberta\" sounds too much like an Astair/Rogers musical, while \"Saskatchewan,\" though longer and harder for youngsters to read and pronounce, sounds like a curse in some exotic language and implies violent action through \"katch\", \"chew\", and \"chew an\".\n\nThe viewer should enjoy the visual splendor and remain unchallenged by the familiar story of cavalry and Indians. I don't know how the Sioux will feel about it. They're the villains of the piece.\n\nIt seems that in the Canadian West of 1877, the white settlers and a handful of Royal Canadian Mounted Police lived in harmony with the local Cree Indians. The Mountie's second-in-command, Alan Ladd, is actually an adopted brother of one of the Cree braves, Jay Silverheels. So far, so reasonable -- and roughly accurate. Somehow the Canadian mountains and the high plains were absorbed into the country with a nearly complete absence of the kinds of violence that took place in that great nation to the south.\n\nThen two flies appear in the ointment. One is the post's new commanding officer, the principled but adversarial Robert Douglas, heavy of an Errol Flynn swashbuckler and a couple of other such films. He is intent on preventing the peaceful Cree from causing any trouble, so he disarms and alienates them. Mutters Silverheels, \"They teach us to hunt and then they take away our means to do it.\"\n\nThis betrayal tends to drive the Cree into an allegiance with Fly Number Two -- the American Sioux, who have just massacred General Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn and have now escaped across the border into Canada. Bang, bang, and then BOOM. (That's the explosion of a wagon filled with barrels of black gunpowder blowing a dozen Indians to smithereens.) \n\nLet's see. What else. Ladd mutinies against Douglas and relieves him of his service revolver and his authority. Shelly Winters joins the party in a low-cut dress, accompanied by Hugh O'Brien as a sheriff escorting her back to Great Falls, Montana, to be hanged for a killing for which the treacherous O'Brien himself was responsible. And the victim was his own brother. Well, you can see what kind of guy Hugh O'Brien is. No wonder that Ladd, half his size, keeps punching him out.\n\nThe direction is by Raoul Walsh and it zips along as most of his Warners productions did. Walsh, like many old-school directors, didn't hold with psychological nonsense. A man was what a man was. Similarly, a woman was what a woman was. They were defined by their actions. No inferences allowed. You know, as a minor observation, when this movie was in first release it was criticized by some reviewers because Shelly Winters' wardrobe suggested that she had a bosom. It is to laugh. Actually, Winters' dialog, like all the rest, is concise to the point of being stilted, but she probably gives the most honest performance. Ladd seems content to glory in his blazing red coat with its gilded pips, his blue riding breeches with the gold stripes, and his black boots and silver spurs. As I said, this is colorful stuff. J. Carrol Naish, an Irish-American, is a raggedy French scout this time around. In the past he'd played Asians, Italians, Tibetans, and just about everything except a Siberian Chukchee -- and that only because nobody ever made a movie about the Chukchee. And in every role, he used the same all-purpose accent.\n\nThe plot seems to have been dreamed up by a committee but the location belongs to God alone. The images make you yearn for the clean, dry, cool air of sunny Banff and a scent of pine that doesn't come out of a bottle.",

The cast also suggested that this would be a solid and enjoyable b-movie western that would meet my needs. The film actually did more than that and I found it to be an enjoyable if slightly apologetic b-movie that provided solid characters, a good plot and some exciting (if dated) action scenes. Of course it isn't anything that wonderful and those who dislike the genre would do well to avoid it for obvious reasons. The plot starts well, with some interesting character issues but then does little with them and heads into the usual b-movie territory, forgetting the more interest conflict between O'Rourke and Cajou that appeared to be the focus early on. That said it does well enough for the genre and provided enough entertainment for my needs.\n\nCinematography wise it looks good; despite the claim that it was all filmed in Saskatchewan the presence of rolling hills and impressive mountains suggest that perhaps this was not the case. Despite this it looks good, not John Ford but the bright colours and location feel that the better b-movies could muster. Ladd is enjoyably wide-chested in a typically heroic role and will please genre fans. Winters is a good female co-star, pretty enough to fill that role but feisty enough to avoid blandness. Silverheels has a smaller role than I would have liked and people like Long, Douglas and Naish all fill their roles well enough despite not doing anything in particular of merit.\n\nOverall this is a solid b-movie western that does all that you expect it to and, if that is what you want, you'll enjoy it like I did. It could have done more of course but it works for what it is and the colourful presentation and solid pace help cover what \"could have been\" with what is.",

However, the action is of high standard, with lots of extras and horses whizzing about to create excitement, and the photography in and around Banff National Park in Alberta is sublime.

In fact, we might think of the present film as a long-delayed fictionalized sequel to that film, as it deals with the post-Little Bighorn Sioux movement into adjacent Canada and their interactions with the resident Cree. On the other hand, the plot much more resembles 2 other spin offs of the late '40s and early '50s I am familiar with:John ford's 'Fort Apache'and Anthony Mann's 'The Last Frontier'. These 2 films generally get higher ratings than the present film, although 'The Last Frontier' is probably no better known today. That film dealt with the US army's conflicts with the Sioux headed by Red Cloud in a slightly earlier era, just as the Civil War was drawing to a close, and is based on a historical conflict. In 'Forte Apache', the Sioux are replaced by the Apache. In all 3 films, at some point, there is a strong conflict between an 'injin'-savvy subordinate and the company commander who is either naive in dealing with 'injins' or feels duty-bound to deal with them as he believes his distant superiors wish. In the end, the rebel is vindicated. To one who has seen all 3 of these films, clearly 'Fort Apache' is the most entertaining, because of the charisma of the main adversaries(John Wayne and Henry Fonda) and the periodically interjected humor of some of the supporting actors. In contrast, the other 2 films lack any substantial humor to break up the drama, save for Victor Mature's taunting of Robert Preston, who has fallen into a bear trap pit. In 'The Last Frontier', Mature certainly provides a more animated charismatic rebel than the rather stiff monotonic Alan Ladd in the present film. This is the third film of this era I have seen , in which Shelly Winters is the lone white female among a horde of men traveling through a hostile 'injin'-infested West. Usually, she comes across as a hard-bitten floozy, sporting a low-cut dress, although she seems a tad more respectable in the present film.\n\nThe gorgeous Canadian Rockies scenery is certainly one of the pluses for this film even though, geographically, it has no business being on the route from Saskatchewan to Great Falls, Montana.It was amusing seeing Alan Ladd in his cardinal red RCMP uniform sneaking up on the Cree encampment in broad daylight, in contrast to a much more appropriate drab buckskin outfit of his French Canadian scout. It was difficult for me to tell the Cree from the Sioux by their dress, horse riding and lodges. The Cree were a very diverse and widespread group. The Plains Cree, by necessity, adopted much the same lifestyle as the Plains Sioux, riding horses and living in bison-derived tepees, as opposed to the Woodland Cree, who made wigwams and canoes out of birch bark. By staging most of this film in the Rockies, both the horsemen and canoeing aspects of Cree transport were included. Jay Silverheels, who achieved fame as The Lone Ranger's constant companion in the TV series, again serves as a sometimes companion and confident to the hero. Hugh O'Brian plays a very conflicted character: a US marshal out to capture Shelly's character for the supposed murder of his brother, but who also has the hots for Shelly, to his ultimate demise.",

The film is not alone in this; there are no mountains in western Oklahoma either, contrary to \"True Grit.\"  \n   Alan Ladd plays O'Rourke, a RCMP officer with a progressive bent who must battle his mutton-headed commander as well as the Indians.  Shelley Winters, here in her brief Marilyn Monroe-competitor period, is an American fugitive in a low cut dress.   Unless you don't see many movies, you can probably surmise complications arising between the two.  Jay Silverheels, later of \"Lone Ranger\" fame, is O'Rourke's Cree companion who angrily leaves him when the RCMP insist on confiscating the tribe's rifles and who must later confront his former friend.\n\n   A previous post noted that the RCMPs are wearing \"Smokey Bear\", not the correct \"sepoy\" hats.   More noticeable to me was the dress of the Indians, who always look to be gussied up for a powwow.   Photographs of the time show that by the late 1800's Indians usually dressed in manufactured (i.e. white) clothes with a some Native touches.   Common sense also makes me doubt leaders wore the heavy, conspicuous headresses into battle, although again this film is not alone in this.\n\n    The plot involves the entry of the Sioux into Canada in the aftermath of Little Big Horn.    In reality, the fragmented Sioux could hardly attempt a takeover of Western Canada, but merely hoped to find refuge from the vengeful U.S. Army.   But here the setup is for a spectacular mass battle at the end, showing Indians charging en masse into white firepower the way they almost never did in actual history.   Noticeably missing from depiction, by the way, are the Sioux women and children who trekked into Canada along with the warriors. \n\n   Because of the spectacular backdrops in Technicolor, this is not too terrible an oater if only to see the conventions of the period.  \n",

Again, the old Western is two dimensional characters as opposed to the one dimensional clich\u00e9 of the Westerns popularized after about 1965.\n\nThis particular one really smacks of generic substance, though. It is pure formula, all the way through. It's as though every clich\u00e9 of the time is used. There just isn't anything fresh here. The scenery makes up for it. It works as \"art\", and moves briskly. Still, it is duller than most of the older Westerns from the classic fifties, the golden age, and undeniably the best age of Westerns. It comes up short against its peers.\n\nBlame it on the writing, but more on the directing. Clever directors find a way around making a clich\u00e9 dull. This is done by making minor characters important. If the writer fails to do it, the ultimate culprit or hero in making the film is the director. If the minor characters hadn't been written so well in \"Shane\", the director would've still had the option of giving them the substance to make it more interesting, and likewise, the director can cut out great bits to make a movie less worthwhile.\n\nIf you do watch this, expect the \"formula\" of old fashioned fun, which still meant making a movie for the audience, instead of the \"formula\" on \"sixties-seventies egotism\", which meant the audience was supposed to be made for the alleged artists. You won't remember much either way, but at least you wont come away depressed, tired, and suicidal after watching this.",

We had seen a beautiful scenery, Mounties and Indians, on rivers and mountains, plus an entertaining film. Seeing this film yesterday I was happy to realize that after so many years my opinion about it is just the same. Raoul Walsh has to his credit great classic westerns like \"Colorado Territory\", \"Pursued\" and \"They Died With Their Boots On\". \"Saskatchewan\" is not on their level but is better than many other westerns directed by Walsh. My impression is that the film was shot mostly in Lake Louise and the mountains surrounding it. The scenery is breathtaking and considering Walsh's expertise on grandiose scenes combining the outdoors with hundreds of people on horses you can be sure you are seeing something unique. Ladd is O'Rourke a man that was raised among the Cree and later became a Mountie. Shelley Winters, in one of her best roles is a woman pursued by the law. The Sioux, after Little Big Horn flee to Canada and try to make the Cree join them. Ladd, who knows the Cree better than his superior, does not agree with him, and is on a way to a court martial. The only way he can redeem himself is by proving that his decision was correct. Fom reading other comments I gathered many people were shocked by this film not being accurate neither by the locations where it was filmed, nor by the story. I can understand their point of view, but I still think it is a good film.",

                "text": "This movie version of the Stefan Zweig story is worth seeing, but it has a lot of unfulfilled potential, and it could have been much more memorable. The story has been filmed several times, and indeed the novella seems ready-made for a movie. It combines an interesting setting, compulsive gambling, suicidal tendencies, a love affair, crime, and quite a bit more into a concise story that plays out in the space of just one day. At the same time, there are some challenges in making it into a movie, since much of the force of the story comes from the psychology of the characters, rather than from their actions.\n\nThe various movie versions have each chosen different ways of framing the main narrative. In this adaptation, the main story is told as a flashback by a writer played by Leo Genn, whose character also played a role in the main story itself. Genn's character is actually a little underused, and doesn't allow him to use some of his best strengths as an actor, but the character itself is a suitable choice for the narration.\n\nThe story takes place in Monte Carlo, and it includes a lot of location footage. But, at least in the public domain print (which could be the problem), the setting and scenery are never quite as striking as you would have expected them to be. Many other movies have used the same setting to more memorable effect.\n\nThe main story has Merle Oberon suitably cast as the young widow who becomes irresistibly attracted to a desperate gambler, and who tries to save him from his addiction to roulette. Oberon's rather ethereal, dreamy presence makes her character's actions seem believable. She is hindered, though, by some weak dialogue that sometimes reduces her deeper feelings to the level of clich\u00e9s.\n\nThe gambler character is never fleshed out, and Richard Todd plays him in a one-dimensional fashion. To some degree, this is supposed to be the character's nature, but even a little more of a sympathetic side could have made the story more powerful. Todd, though, is also hindered by some stale dialogue, even more so than Oberon. The conversations between Oberon and Todd ought to have been the centerpiece of the movie, and with better dialogue they could easily have evoked more passion and tension.\n\nThe story itself focuses attention on the desire of a woman to change a man who really does not want to change all that much. As such, it is a thought-provoking character study, and it provides some useful ideas to think about. In this particular adaptation, the themes are all there on the surface, but they are never examined as deeply as they could have been. It is still adequate as a dramatic story, but it had the potential to be more than that.",

                "text": "At points in this abbreviated version of the European produced romantic drama, you think you're watching an early television version of \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\", for Merle Oberon's character heads after gambler Richard Todd much like Vivien Leigh did for Warren Beatty's gigolo in that Tennessee Williams melodrama. The metaphors of Williams' story are missing, however, and in the faded black and white version of the color movie (trimmed excessively for video release) makes this look like an episode of an early television anthology series. \n\nTold in flashback by an older man (Leo Genn) who obviously loves the heroine, the story traces the downfall of the sophisticated Oberon after striking up an interest in the somewhat melancholy Todd after he storms out of a gambling casino in Monte Carlo and she finds him a hotel room. He becomes excessively paranoid as Oberon's obsession with him gets deeper and deeper. There's really no motivation for her attraction to him beyond the obvious as he is actually pretty condescending to her and obviously using her in spite of his objections to the contrary. \n\nBecause of the slightly older woman/younger man theme, there's a definite comparison to many of Williams' works, particularly \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"Roman Spring\" and \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\". If there's any indication in the obviously missing footage of something important from the plot that explains something deeper in the relationship, hopefully it will show up, along with a color print, as certain sequences (particularly a fireworks scene) cry for it. In its available print, it strikes a high cord of major mediocrity.",

For no discernible reason, Oberon's character becomes obsessed with gambler Todd's 'Young Man', contemplating suicide during the initial flashback scene when he runs a string of bad luck at a gaming table. The tenuous relationship proceeds for a time, but eventually dissolves when the gambling man makes a choice between his addiction and the woman who's melancholy seems to overwhelm the mood of the picture.

The older woman begins to treat the distraught Todd like a gigolo, and he succumbs to her advances. Mr. Genn, who tells the story in flashback, worries about Oberon's relationship with the younger man.\n\nRe-titled \"Affair in Monte Carlo\" for US audiences, this film had great potential as a psychological drama. This is made most evident in Todd's final confrontation with Oberon, when he draws an interesting parallel between his luck and her presence. Moreover, the use of Genn as a rival for Oberon's affections comes too late. Sadly, the script gives Stefan Zweig's story short shrift.

But that doesn't really matter when the story is as well-paced and always fun as it is here.

Whatever reservations you might have, there is still much to enjoy. The animation is great, anybody who likes their colours vibrant, their backgrounds detailed and never sparse and their characters drawn well will not be disappointed at all with the animation of The Eggcited Rooster. The music always adds so much to the Looney Tunes cartoons, and it still does here. I always love with Looney Tunes how the lush orchestration meshes so well with every gag and every sound, and how there is a mix of recognisable tunes and music written especially, which is to heard wonderfully in the music of The Eggcited Rooster. There is some really genius writing as well, there is plenty of sharp wit and lines like \"This boy is making more noise than a\ufeff couple of skeletons on a tin roof!\" are genuinely hilarious. Not just that, but there are also some imaginative sight gags, the best one- and the one that always cracks me up- is when the doghouse explodes and you see Barnyard Dog with a fried egg on his stomach. Mel Blanc was one of few voice actors to voice multiple characters in one cartoon alone and be consistent every time, and as you'd expect his voice work is stellar with plenty of energy, inspired dialogue delivery and verve.

                "text": "There are two styles of Film Noir. Fueled by writers like James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler, the first style emerged in the 1940s and was characterized by a cynical, often witty tone; anti-heroes, dangerous women, and assorted criminal elements; and complex plots that emphasized betrayal and moral ambiguity. It was also photographed in a remarkable visual style that combined glossy production values with atmospheric emphasis on light and shadow--and films like THE MALTESE FALCON, THIS GUN FOR HIRE, MILDRED PIERCE, THE BLUE DAHLIA, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY remain great classics of their kind.\n\nBut after World War II public taste began to change. Things that could only be hinted at in earlier films could now be more directly stated, and as audiences clamored for a more gritty realism the glossy sophistication of 1940s Noir fell out of fashion. The result was a new style of Noir--photographed in a grainier way, more direct, more brutal, and even less sympathetic to its characters. And the 1948 THE NAKED CITY was among the first to turn the tide. The sophisticated gumshoe, slinky gun moll, and glossy production values were gone; this film felt more like something you might read in a particularly lurid \"true detective\" tabloid.\n\nIn an era when most films were shot on Hollywood backlots, THE NAKED CITY was actually filmed in New York--and while filmmakers could film with hidden cameras sound technology of the day posed a problem. But producer Mark Hellinger turned the problem into an asset: the film would be narrated, adding to the documentary-like style of the cinematography and story. (Hellinger performed the narrative himself, and his sharp delivery is extremely effective.) The story itself reads very much like a police report, following NYPD detectives as they seek to solve a dress model's murder.\n\nFor 1948 it was innovative stuff-but like many innovative films it falters a bit in comparison to later films that improved upon the idea. The direct nature of the plot feels slightly too direct, slightly too simple. The same is true of the performances, which have a slightly flat feel, and although Barry Fitzgerald gives a sterling performance he is very much a Hollywood actor whose style seems slightly out of step alongside the deadpan style of the overall cast. Even so, the pace and drive of the film have tremendous interest, and while you might find yourself criticizing certain aspects you'll still be locked into the movie right to the very end. Particularly recommended for Film Noir addicts, who will be fascinated to see the turning point in the style.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

                "text": "\nThere are 8 Million Stories in the Naked City.  This is the one that started it all.  And what a start it was.  While \"The Naked City\" is considered \"Film-Noir\" by many who have seen it, in truth it is simply a routine detective story.  What makes the film as great as it is(and it is a great film)is the Oscar winning photography by William Daniels who shot the film not in a studio but on the streets and in the buildings of \"The Naked City\", New York City.\n\nFrom the very opening of the film when Producer-Narrator Mark Hellinger introduces himself and tells you that this film \"is quite different from anything you've ever seen\",  the viewer is hooked. And it is not by the story but by the city.\n\nHellinger's cast did not consist of any major players.  Barry Fitzgerald, stars as Lieutenant Muldoon, the head of the Homicide Squad,  Don Taylor is Jimmy Halloran, Muldoon\"s \"leg work\" man.  Howard Duff is the slimy Niles and Dorothy  Hart, a beautiful actress who should have gone on to bigger and better things, was a model.  They were all perfect.  Ted De Corsia in his first screen role, played Willie Garzah the killer.  His death scene at the top of the Williamsburg Bridge is memorable.  He nearly steals the picture but not from the actors, but from the city who is the real \"star\" of the film.\n\nHellinger was formerly a New York Newspaper man.  He started his Hollywood career as a screenwriter and among his successes was the 1939 Bogart-Cagney classic, \"The Roaring Twenties\" another film about New York.  The city was very personal to him.\n\nThe sad part of the film is the tragedy of some of the major participants. Hellinger died of a heart attach shortly after the release.  He was only 44.\n\nAlbert Maltz who co-wrote the screenplay was blacklisted as being one of the Hollywood 10, and didn't work for decades.  Jules Dassin the director fled to Europe because of threats of blacklisting.  He later made the classic \"Rififi\" and Oscar winners, \"Topkapi\" and \"Never On Sunday\".  We can only wonder what might have been had this association continued.\n\nWhat we do know is that \"The Naked City\" still lives on.  You can see it in nearly every episode of the TV his \"Law & Order\".  And as long as those skyscrapers of New York stand, there will always be a \"Naked City\"\n\n",

                "text": "THE NAKED CITY is like watching a time capsule unfold of New York City in the late '40s--the cars, the subways, the bridges, the people bustling along busy streets totally unaware of filming (scenes were shot from cars with tinted windows and two-way mirrors), and at the center of it all is a rather routine detective story. But the difference is the style that director Jules Dassin gets out of his material, giving the drama a chance to build up the proper tension before the final shootout on city streets and bridges.\n\nBARRY FITZGERALD is the detective with the very helpful sidekick DON TAYLOR, a young police officer from Queens who helps him track down the man responsible for the death of a pretty blonde in what the tabloids called \"The Bathtub Murder\". Both men are excellent as they follow a batch of clues to get to the bottom of the crime. HOWARD DUFF is also excellent as a man mixed up in the robberies, with DOROTHY HART as his unsuspecting sweetheart.\n\nTED DeCORSIA, making his film debut, is the athletic villain, working out in his small apartment when detective Taylor finds him--but soon making his escape which leads to the film's most breathtaking moments of a dazzling chase that fills the last ten minutes with high tension suspense.\n\nThe crime itself is not that interesting, but the style used to tell the tale (with a voice-over narration telling us at the conclusion that this is just one story in a city of millions) is what makes it far superior to most detective stories. That and the fact that New York City is given the spotlight for location photography that really hits the mark.",

                "text": "This is a real original and just about everybody involved knows it. A documentary style police drama with real New York locations -- \"Nothing was shot in a studio!\" And it does capture New York City, circa 1947, entering a late florescent age. Many of the shots were \"stolen,\" taken on real streets from a van with tinted windows, with only the principal actors knowing that a movie was being made.\n\nWhite collar workers all wear suits and ties. There is a sidewalk salesman hawking neckties. An ice man with those over-sized calipers. A milkman driving a horse and wagon. A Kosher Deli. Little girls playing jump rope -- \"Out goes the doctor, out goes the nurse, out goes the lady with the alligator purse.\" Kids on swings. People reading newspapers over someone else's shoulder while jolting along on the subway. A shootout on a tower of the Williamsberg Bridge. A blind man and his dog. Stillman's Gym with two professional wrestlers being coached in how to register pain. Two girls gawking at a wedding dress in a shop window and mooning over \"Frankie.\" Ethnic people -- Italians, Irish, Jewish, Polish. Accents -- \"A boxer-fighter maybe? What do I know?\" \"Eh, bene, bene -- encore.\" Scrubby walnut trees in brick-strewn vacant lots. Working class accents mostly, including that of the narrator, Mark Hellinger. Nobody is black or Puerto Rican. The taxi drivers speak English. No bums or dopers. It's all here, or rather it was all there.\n\nNow, of course, it's all a little familiar because we've gotten used to location shooting and wince when shots are obviously studio made. But this was new at the time and is still enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe performances are adequate. Don Taylor is bland and doesn't have any accent but he's easy to identify with, at least for me, because he's so pleasant and handsome. Barry Fitzgerald has an oddly creased face and crudely shaped cranium. His smile is almost a mile wide, a caricature of itself, a lovable guy. Howard Duff is -- well, Howard Duff, a liar and a thief. Ted deCorsia is great. We first meet him working out in his shabby apartment, flexing and admiring himself in front of the mirror, his body pale and flabby, a shock of coarse black hair over his sweating forehead. And that voice, like a coffee grinder. And check out the list of supporting actors. Wow. Arthur O'Connell, Nehemia Persoff, James Gregory, inter alia.\n\nThe story itself isn't very much. Rather routine. Could have been a good radio drama of the sort that were popular at the time -- \"Suspense\" or \"The Whistler\" or \"Inner Sanctum.\" And the narrator's voice-over sometimes creaks at the joints as it strains for hard-boiled sonority -- \"Yesterday she was just another pretty face. This morning she's the marmalade on everybody's toast.\" (That line kills me.) \n\nAnd, I have to admit, that it paints a kind of pretty picture of police procedures. Barry Fitzgerald in particular is folksy, humorous, and compassionate. I kept waiting for him to remove his pipe and mutter, \"Ego te absolvo.\" The police offices look too CLEAN. There are no dents in the wall from suspects having their heads slammed against it. Every surface seems too recently to have been painted. Suspects who shout angrily at their police interrogators and are obviously lying are just politely reasoned with.\n\nIn a neat little touch, the cops are examining the scene of the crime and have found a few stray long hairs. From behind, Fitzgerald leans over the rather mopey middle-aged neighbor on the couch an compares the hair sample to hers. She looks around in surprise. \"Er, don't mind me,\" says Fitzgerald, \"I was only admiring your lovely hair.\" The neighbor clutches her hands together with delight and gazes up at him with an adoring dimpled smile. Fitzgerald pauses a moment, clears his throat, and hurries away. \n\nWell, okay. This might have been \"gritty\" at the time but now it's just an interesting picture, a little glossy maybe, but a lot of fun, and ahead of its time with that location shooting by Daniels.",

                "text": "\nThat's just what the producer, Mark Hellinger does.  He tries to make it clear from the introduction that this is not your average movie.  It is not.  This entire production tries to accomplish one thing - authenticity.  And for the most part, it succeeds.\n\nBefore I get to what's right about this movie, let me mention a few of the things that are wrong.  Ted DeCorsia overacts.  He always overacts.  Howard Duff's character, Frankie Niles, is supposed to be a streetwise grifter.  How the hell could he be dumb enough to get himself in as many pickles as he did.  Anybody who has ever been around the block would know better than to lie to the cops about everything.  Just lie about the important things and tell the truth when it won't hurt you.  If this guy is a sociopath, he's the dumbest one in town.  Although most of the accents are on the money, the incidental dialogue injected into some of the scenes sounds forced and phony.  In fact, it sounds like Hollywood trying to sound like New York.  Mark Hellinger's narration, by comparison, is not only authentic, it's practically Damon Runyonesque.\n\nNow - what's right.  Practically everything else.  The location photography is the New York I remember as a kid.  While I was watching some of the hot summer scenes downtown, I could practically smell the asphalt, melting tar, and garbage.  Don Taylor's brick duplex in Queens was just the kind of house that every struggling family on the wrong side of Brooklyn aspired to.\n\nI won't comment on the story except to say, it's an entirely believable crime story.  I seem to remember Barry Fitzgerald playing a similar role in Union Station.  Reminds one of the old days when most of the cops were Irish - and New York was really New York.",

                "text": "This film is in many ways a good example of Film Noir--since it portrays a murder and its investigation, has a classic Noir-style ending and has some very \"dark\" story elements. However, unlike traditional Film Noir, the dialog and lighting are much more like a traditional film--less snappy dialog and more of an emphasis on conventional police work. This is NOT really a bad thing, as the film still was very entertaining but with a lighter and almost documentary feel to it and with a greater emphasis on the police work instead of on the sleazy Noir villains. In fact, since the film focused on the police and the day to day aspects of the investigation, it helped to usher in a style of film making that would be very popular in the 1950s on TV and in theaters (such as the show DRAGNET or the movie HE WALKED BY NIGHT).\n\nThe film itself stars Barry Fitzgerald. This is a VERY unusual casting decision but it did work very well. Normally, Fitzgerald is known for cute supporting roles, like the ones he played in GOING MY WAY and THE QUIET MAN. Here, however, he's a detective who coordinates the investigation. I liked it this way because he was far from the macho cop but more like a REAL policeman--experienced, smart and not about to resort to a fist fight with his foes--avoiding the usual movie clich\u00e9s to say the least! In addition, the rest of the cast also seem more like real policemen when compared to other films of the time. The criminals, likewise, seem real and aren't obviously \"bad\" like they usually are in crime films--again a big plus.\n\nSo overall, this is a very realistic and engaging crime film with elements of Noir but certainly NOT the traditional style for the genre (the familiar Noir dialog, lighting, film angles, femme fatales, etc. are missing because they wouldn't be appropriate). It may disappoint some die-hard Noir fans, but for me it was quite acceptable and a good change of pace.",

This satisfying 1948 film brings us back to the way New York, and especially Manhattan looked at that time. The Lower East Side, especially, in all its chaotic splendor offers a nostalgic look to our past.\n\nIt took the genius of Jules Dassin to see the opportunities for bringing this story by Malvin Wald to the screen. Albert Maltz worked on the screen play with Mr. Wald and the result is a movie that shows the diverse culture of the city. Although the film is about crime in New York City, there are aspects of it that shows how most of what we see is interconnected. This film was the basis for a successful, and innovative television series that showed a different crime story every week and how the NYPD dealt with solving the cases.\n\nThe film starts with a drunk being knocked out and thrown into the river. A woman is discovered dead in her bathtub by her maid. It's determined chloroform was involved in her death. Enter Lt. Muldoon, whose precinct gets involved in the investigation. Muldoon and his right hand man, Det. Jimmy Halleran, also find out jewelry is missing. The dead woman Jean Dexter, a fashion model, leads the police to a Dr. Stoneman, a man that loved her. At the same time, another detective discovers a cigarette case that points to another man, Frank Niles, who also appears to be involved. The drunk in the river was a jewelry thief and he, in turn, points to Harmonica Willie, a tough guy with a criminal record.\n\nAll the elements come together in a great finale that involves a chase on the Williamsburg bridge. Jules Dassin decided to bring his cameras to the streets showing what a real New York looked like and got an excellent performance from most of the people that had no idea they were providing themselves as extras for the film. William Daniels, Greta Garbo's favorite cameraman, and distinguished a director himself, photographed the city in all its glory.\n\nAll the principals do an excellent work in the film. Barry Fitzgerald as Lt. Muldoon shows in fine form. Don Taylor plays Jimmy Halleran. A fine performance from a young Howard Duff, as Frank Niles, is one of the best things in the picture. Ted DeCorsia is seen as a criminal who loves to keep in shape and play his harmonica.\n\nBut what made the film fun for this viewer are the uncredited faces in the picture. We spotted Paul Ford, John Randolph, Nehemiah Persoff, Molly Picon, David Opatashu, and other character actors of that era. It says a lot about their generosity in appearing without being mentioned, something that today would appear unimaginable.\n\nCredit must go to Jules Dassin for this enormously satisfying movie!",

The way Barry Fitzgerald as the lieutenant breaks done and rips open Howard Duff is especially memorable, as is the scene of the two parents of the dead girl breaking down.

                "text": "\nTHE NAKED CITY is without equal in the history of film-making as far as gritty, realistic police procedurals shot on-location in a semidocumentary style are concerned. As a youngster growing up in Queens, New York during the 1950s, I used to watch it endlessly when it played on a show called Million Dollar Movie on New York's Channel 9. It was filmed in the summer of 1947 during a heat wave which baked the city. It had an visceral impact on me that was far-reaching and which I still feel every time I see it. It captivated me then and still captivates me today. I conservatively estimate that I have seen this film at least 150 times and I never grow tired of watching it. Even though I know everything that's going to happen, scene by scene and shot by shot, it still has the power to grab me and excite me and involve me. It's a time machine, a nostalgic look back on a world that once existed in a simpler time and age.\n\nTowards the end of the Second World War, a new style of film-making emerged in Hollywood that was influenced by the work of the combat camera crews in the various branches of the armed forces. Capturing the battles and campaigns of World War II on film and creating a permanent still photo and filmic record of that conflict, the work of these wartime cameramen helped to influence a new generation of Hollywood filmmaker. One of them was Mark Hellinger, the producer and narrator of THE NAKED CITY, who was, himself, a member of the U.S. Army Air Force's Motion Picture Unit during the war. The use of on-location filming in an urban environment combined with a semidocumentary approach was the hallmark of this new school of film-making. Although the use of on-location filming had been used earlier in American cinematography, its use was sporadic and not indicative of a trend. The postwar period saw it come into its own.\n\nThe tone of THE NAKED CITY is set from the first opening shot. The City of New York is the real star of this movie. It's the backdrop against which the human drama unfolds and is played out. Aerial views of Manhattan Island are seen from a helicopter as Mark Hellinger delivers his opening narration. He introduces himself to us and informs us in a teaser that the motion picture we're about to see is \"a bit different from most films you've ever seen.\" He goes on to say that \"It was not photographed in a studio\" and that the actors \"played out their roles on the streets, in the apartment houses, in the skyscrapers of New York itself.\" And joining them were the thousands of New Yorkers captured on film going about their daily lives. \"This is the city as it is- hot summer pavements, the children at play, the buildings in their naked stone, the people, without makeup.\" His voice-over narration will carry through the entire film at many points.\n\nThe basic storyline concerns the police investigation into the death of a twenty-six year old dress model named Jean Dexter who was found drowned in the bathtub inside her apartment located at 52 W. 83rd St. on Manhattan's Upper West Side. We learn that she's the daughter of a Polish immigrant couple named Batory from Lakewood, New Jersey and that before coming to New York City, her name was Mary Batory. We will learn later on that her grieving, anguished mother blames the lure and attraction of the big city for her daughter's death. \"Who knows what she ran around with?\", grieves her mother. The Homicide Squad responds followed by the City Medical Examiner who ascertains rather quickly that the woman's death was not the result of an accident or suicide. She had chloroform burns around her mouth and there were bruises on her throat, shoulders, and arms. The Medical Examiner determined that she had been anesthetized after a struggle and dumped into the tub alive. The presence of white foam around her mouth led him to draw that conclusion. The Homicide Squad goes into action and we are introduced to the two lead Detectives who will be spearheading the investigation- Detective Lieutenant Dan Muldoon(BARRY FITZGERALD) and Detective Jimmy Halloran(DON TAYLOR). The Lieutenant is a wise old veteran, having been on the job for 38 years, 22 of them with the Homicide Squad. He's like a precursor to the Lieutenant Columbo character played by Peter Falk during the 1970s on TV- intelligent, methodical, hard-working, and diligent. We learn that Detective Halloran is new to the Homicide Squad, earning an assignment to that prestigious command six months before after working as a beat patrolman in the Bronx. He is a World War II veteran who served as an infantry rifleman in Europe and who lives in an attached brick house in Jackson Heights, Queens with his wife and young son. That community happens to be the same one I lived and grew up in. In the movie, he lives on 86th Street near Northern Boulevard and I grew up not very far from there. Assuming that he was hired by the Police Department right after he got out of the Army, it seems that he wasn't in uniform very long before being promoted to Detective Third Grade. He must have demonstrated some instinctive knack for police work, resulting in some good arrests, to be promoted so soon. \n\nThe film depicts the investigative aspect of police work to be anything but glamorous. It is tedious, difficult, frustrating and depressing. The detectives are shown as diligent, hardworking civil servants who take their job seriously and try their best to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Their investigation takes a detour into another area of felonious behavior when they discover that the murdered woman was part of a jewel burglary ring that targeted high society types. She and her boyfriend Frank Niles(HOWARD DUFF) were the fixers. Niles is a smarmy, oily ne'er-do-well with a college degree who's a pathological liar. He lies to the police, he lies to his fianc\u00e9e Ruth Morrison(DOROTHY HART) and he lies to himself. He has no scruples or shame whatsoever. He was two-timing his fianc\u00e9e with Jean Dexter and she was never any the wiser. When he's brought down to the precinct in the very early stage of the investigation, he lies through his teeth when questioned. He's seemingly oblivious of the fact that one of the Detectives is sitting there writing down what he's saying and that his statements will surely be checked for veracity. He piles one lie on top of another. His statements that he's a Merchandising Consultant and a combat veteran of the South Pacific campaign are quickly revealed to be bald-faced lies. After checking him out, Lt. Muldoon tells him \"I have a report in front of me that says you never were in the South Pacific, Mr. Niles. You weren't in the 77th Division. You weren't an officer. You weren't even in the Army.\"\n\nAfter reviewing some photographs of the deceased, Lt. Muldoon quickly realizes that at least two men did the murder. He comes to this conclusion by pointing out that there were finger marks on both arms. This meant that one man held her by both arms while the second applied the chloroform to render her unconscious. It turns out that Niles' alibi for the time of the murder stacks up, but the police still feel he's withholding information and knows more than he's telling. The police are not Nile's only worry. He's also being followed and watched by the killer who had been in his employ as one of the jewel burglars targeting the society people. The killer is named Willie Garzah(TED DE CORSIA) and he plans on killing Niles before he winds up spilling his guts to the police. In this he almost succeeds, invading Nile's apartment at night and rendering him unconscious. The impromptu arrival of Muldoon and Halloran, who came to question Niles further, interrupts what would have been Garzah's third murder. This guy is a one-man crime wave. He flees down the fire escape after a shootout with the Detectives and escapes. Garzah killed his partner Peter Backalis(WALTER BURKE) four hours after they murdered Jean Dexter. Backalis was a drinker and Garzah couldn't trust him to keep his mouth shut, so he follows the drunken man to the pier, knocks him unconscious with a wooden stick and tosses him into the East River. It's revealed later on that the reason Dexter was killed was because Garzah wanted a bigger cut from the proceeds of the burglaries. Apparently Dexter balked at giving him more, so he murdered her. Dr. Lawrence Stoneman(HOUSE JAMESON), Dexter's personal physician and high-living society doctor, was in on these night burglaries in a peripheral way. He was smitten with Dexter after seeing her at the dress shop where she worked and they wound up having an affair. In his own words, he was \"drunk with her, lost.\" She was also sleeping with Niles, who was engaged to Ruth Morrison, her co-worker at the dress shop. For a story that's taking place in the more conservative 1940s, there sure seems to be a lot of sleeping around going on. Dr. Stoneman realized he was being used but felt powerless to do anything. When the police catch up to him, he tells them that his wife is a party-giver and Jean Dexter would find out from him who was going to be there. Months went by before he realized that when people came to his house parties, their apartments were robbed the same night by unknown individuals hired by Niles and Dexter. Knowing that he will be charged as an accomplice before the fact, and that his life as he knew it is now over, he attempts to jump out his office window but is pulled to safety by the police and Niles, who is technically under arrest at this point.\n\nThe big break in the case comes from rookie Detective Halloran. He has a hunch that there's a connection between the deaths of Jean Dexter and Peter Backalis. He explains his reasoning to Lt. Muldoon, telling him that the two deaths were only a few hours apart and that Backalis had served two years in Sing Sing for stealing jewelry. Muldoon pooh-poohs this and asks him what Backalis' record shows in light of the fact that the jewel thefts Niles and Dexter were involved in concerned high society robberies. Halloran replies that Backalis' crime was \"Small-time. Pawnshop burglary in Queens.\" Halloran still wants to follow his hunch though, and Muldoon finally agrees, seeing as how they're not making much headway with the investigation. Halloran pays a visit to Backalis' former parole officer in the Bronx County Courthouse and finds out the name of the arresting officer in the pawnshop burglary, a Patrolman Albert Hicks of the 108th Precinct in Long Island City. Halloran interviews Hicks(JAMES GREGORY) in the railroad yard at night and learns that Backalis had a partner with him that night named Willie. He asks what happened to him and Hicks replies \"He got away by the neatest trick I've ever seen. I nailed Backalis in the back alley and he yells 'Beat it, Willie.' And this other customer throws a chair through a plate glass window, dives right after it and comes up on his feet like an acrobat. Then he's off like a streak.\" He also mentions that this guy was big, \"like an All-American fullback\" and that since one of the stolen items was a harmonica, he figured that Willie must have liked to play one. Halloran informs his Lieutenant about this development and Muldoon assigns two other Detectives to work with him in trying to ascertain Willie's identity. They canvass talent agencies, gyms and sporting arenas where hopefully someone will remember a muscular acrobat who likes to play the harmonica. They hit paydirt when a Detective visits Stillman's Gym and asks the manager on duty if he or the two wrestlers he's coaching know of a wrestler who liked to play the harmonica. The manager says \"Sure. Willie the Harmonica Player. Willie Garzah. I teached him how to wrestle.\" The Detective asks if they know where he lives or used to live. One of the wrestlers tells him that Garzah lived on Staten Island with his brother. The Detectives track the brother down to a building under construction where he works as a laborer. He speaks disdainfully of his brother Willie and tells the Detectives that his brother has a room somewhere around the Williamsburg Bridge. They ask if he has a picture of him and he replies, \"No, but when he was wrestling the newspapers printed his mug a few times.\" The Detectives realize that now they can put a face to the name. The police, armed with Garzah's photo, start canvassing the entire Lower East Side. Detective Halloran gets a lead and calls his command to let them know that he's located Garzah \"on Norfolk Street between Rivington and Houston.\" He's so excited he can barely contain himself. He tracks Garzah down to the tenement building he lives in and instead of calling for backup, like he should, he races headlong into danger by going up to Garzah's room by himself. Garzah invites him in and we see Garzah exercising, wearing only trunks and sneakers. He is in very good physical condition - big, strong, muscular and well-sculpted. At the sight of him, Halloran's bravura seems to disappear and he looks kind of nervous even though he's armed with his police revolver. He tells Garzah that he works at Bellevue Hospital and that a patient, Peter Backalis, was asking after him. Garzah sees right through this and realizes that his visitor is a cop, but he plays along for the moment until he can get into position. He overpowers Halloran and pins him on the floor. He removes Halloran's gun from the shoulder holster under his suit jacket and orders him to stand up. Garzah contemptuously ridicules Halloran for his feeble attempt to con him and orders him to turn around. Halloran, fearing a bullet in the back of the head, nervously tells Garzah \"Don't be a fool.\" Garzah replies \"I'll prove I'm smart, copper. You're scared right now I'm gonna rub you out. But I ain't, 'cause I'm smart. Rub out a cop and you really get the chair. All I need to do is put you to sleep, then I'm off. Try and find me. This is a great big beautiful city. Just try and find me.\" With that he delivers a rabbit punch to the back of Halloran's neck, knocking him out. He flees the apartment, with Halloran pursuing him after he recovers. By this time, the general alarm has been sounded and the area is swarming with police who are looking for both men. Garzah manages to blend into the crowd and evades the police for the moment, but unduly panics at the gateway to the Williamsburg Bridge on Delancey Street when he spies the police cars closing in. He rushes up the stairs to the pedestrian walkway and in his haste, collides with a blind man with a seeing eye dog. The dog goes for Garzah, biting his left arm and holding on. Garzah shoots the dog and the gunshot brings the police running. Garzah runs along the walkway towards the Brooklyn side with the police in hot pursuit on foot and in cars. A brief shootout occurs when Garzah fires on a police car that stopped to unload some officers. The chase continues and Garzah finds himself cornered by the tower on the Manhattan side of the bridge. He looks straight up and sees the stairway that runs up the length of the tower. He hoists himself up to a metal door which leads to the stairway and goes through it. But when he tries to close it, the dooe clangs open and Halloran fires at him, hitting him in the stomach. Garzah starts his climb to the top and some of the Officers begin to follow, but Lt. Muldoon calls them back saying \"We want no dead heroes. There's no place he can go to now.\" Ignoring entreaties by Muldoon to come down and surrender, Garzah continues his torturous climb to the top, a bullet in his gut and his left arm mangled and bloody. Reaching the end of the line, he positions himself on a narrow platform at the top of the tower. Muldoon shouts \"All right, Garzah. We give you a hundred percent in acrobatics. Now will you come down under your own power or do you want a little persuasion? What do you say, Garzah?\" Garzah answers by firing a shot down which almost hits Muldoon. The police duck and then return fire, hitting Garzah numerous times. Garzah, mortally wounded, loses his grip on the railing he was holding on to and in a final acrobatic performance with the city as his backdrop, falls head first down the length of the tower, screaming his life away. The last scene is an epitaph to the murdered woman, rendered by Mark Hellinger over scenes of New York at night. We see the people who knew her in life and those who gave her justice in death. He intones somberly that \"These are the lights that a child born to the name of Batory hungered for. Her passion has been played out now. Her name, her face, her history were worth five cents a day for six days. Tomorrow a new case will hit the headlines. Yet some will remember Jean Dexter. She won't be entirely forgotten. Not entirely. Not altogether.\" He concludes with the famous tagline \"There are eight million stories in the Naked City. This has been one of them.\"\n",

Daniels, The Naked City just doesn't add up to a great movie whole. The story follows a police procedural pattern as Barry Fitzgerald's Lt. Dan Muldoon and his wet behind the ears side-kick Jimmy Halloran (Don Taylor) try to crack the case of a murdered blonde playgirl. With no clues, the pair run down a number of blind alleys chasing weak leads. Can they crack the case? Will young Halloran be able to learn the wily ways of the experienced New York Cop before it's too late?\n\nPerhaps it's the reputation that did it down for this first time viewer? Or maybe the ream of imitations that followed it have put the film so high on a pedestal it's now impossible to achieve expectation levels? Maybe yes to both, but I found it to be very ordinary and bogged down by a too talky core that's executed poorly by a host of mundane acting performances. Fitzgerald hams it for all he is worth, with is comedy moments severely misplaced, while Taylor is out acted by a door. The rest I can't bare to talk about. The one saving grace is Ted de Corsia's villain, a nasty piece of work that gets a nice line in desperation/mania from Corsia.\n\nNo doubt about it, Daniels' work, de Corsia and a thrilling last ten minutes, stopped this from hitting the below average mark from this disillusioned observer. 5/10",

                "text": "Although this type of noir story is done today with even more grittier realism than they had in 1948, THE NAKED CITY really holds up superbly. All types of film productions and constructions have to begin at some point, and Jules Daissin's decision to shoot this film in 1948 New York was brilliant.\n\nIt is always of double interest to look at a film shot in an earlier version of your city or any city. Buildings that were once seemingly part of the ever present New York Scene turn out to have been as mortal as human beings are. Today if one sees distance shots in 1990 films showing the World Trade Towers, you can see the best example of this (and the most aggravating). The site of the streets of the different ethnic sections of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn in 1948 (now totally different in their main ethnic make-up) is one thing that gets us. Back then the Lower East Side meant Jews. Little Italy meant Italians. Chinatown meant Chinatown. Now Chinatown has expanded into Little Italy, and the Jews (for the most part) moved out of the Lower East Side, and their apartments are full of Latinos. \n\nIt is pointed out in one of the reviews that a stumbling block in this film (for a modern audience) was that there is little visibility of African-Americans and Latinos. I would agree it is odd, except most of the investigation of Don Taylor and Barry Fitzgerald was in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The enclaves (at that time) of African-Americans and Latinos in Manhattan were Harlem and Spanish Harlem, which are on the North side of the Island. \n\nIt was a gutsy move to take the film to the City - but Daissin was always innovative in trying to make whatever film he did seem realistic. The subject matter, the murder of a model - turned mistress - turned member of a burglary gang, was also up his alley. Daissin's best films (RIFIFI, TOPKAPI) examine the mechanics of the underworld - how does a jewelry heist get accomplished, how does a the human element undue everything. If John Huston had not done THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, Daissin would have been a perfect substitute for that story as well. Here from a mysterious tragedy, Taylor and Fitzgerald find a story that goes up and down the entire social system, involving professional burglars (Ted De Corsia and Walter Burke), first generation Americans in the rather new suburbs (Adelaide Klein and Grover Burgess), a society doctor who ruins himself (House Jamison), and pathological misfits trying to find a place for themselves in society (Howard Duff). The connecting link is the deceased - a girl who wanted a career and freedom from the stultifying life she left in New Jersey. Instead she found death.\n\nFitzgerald is criticized for his Hollywood style staginess - actually he probably developed his staginess from exactly that: the stage (the Abbey Players he belonged to, with his brother Arthur Shields, and others who frequently were in John Ford movies). In reality he is not over-the-top. His best moment is when he and Taylor and some other detectives are talking about the case, and Fitzgerald picks up on his \"everyman\" style suspect that he trots out to solve his mysteries. Fitzgerald is enjoying the moment - he even gave the \"everyman\" an Irish name. He reasons (quite correctly) that if one just looks at the average criminal as like an \"everyman\" the behavior mirrored in the crime scenes is fairly simple to figure out, and that you can narrow down the possibilities until you get the right perpetrator. Actually it is a reasonable way of doing it.\n\nDuff's emotional collapse is another highpoint - a pathological liar he finds his lies are meaningless now that they have led to the murder of a harmless girl. Another key scene belongs to Adelaide Klein. Her Mrs. Bathory is absolutely angry at her daughter for leaving home for a life in the City. Why were they living in the suburbs but to escape the grime of the city? She won't say a single thing for the deceased until she sees the girl's corpse, and then just breaks down - she did love the little girl who grew up after all. Jamison's doctor, besotted with the girl who he gave information used for a string of burglaries, also collapses after his confession. He is stopped by Taylor before he can kill himself (more lucky - or less, depending on how you look at it - than Louis Calhern in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE). \n\nCollapse under strain follows even the villain. I wish someone did a real study on Ted De Corsia. One of a string of movie heavies in the noir tradition (with Howard De Silva and Jack Lambert, among others) they replaced the perpetuals of an earlier period (the aristocrats: Zucco, Atwill, Daniel, Macready, Rathbone - not totally but sufficiently because they fit into the roles better). De Corsia had begun only a year before as the obnoxious, blackmailing, and doomed gumshoe for hire Sidney Broome in THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, but although quite effective there his character was secondary. Here he is quite cool and controlled (on the surface) bumping off two associates, and nearly a third one, escaping into the anonymity of the city, and even (quite intentionally) just knocking out Taylor because he doesn't want the chair for killing a cop. But in his almost perfect escape his nerves are on edge, and a final, unexpected error leads to his last stand. \n\nYes, there have been many similar gritty film noir since 1948, and there may be eight million more in our futures - but this was a great one!",

Released in March of 1948 \" The Naked City\" at first became a major movie success in that year and now is considered by many to be one of the best crime/film noir/ movies ever made. In the dark and early morning hours in an apartment high-rise on the quiet and chic upper West Side of Manhattan to a blazing afternoon sun on the top of a tower over the East River on the heavily traveled crowded and noisy Williamsburg Bridge a story is played out that will lay bare and strip naked every emotion that can be packed into a motion picture. Fashion model Jean Dexter is brutally murdered in her apartment and then dumped into the bathtub to make it look like she overdosed on drugs and drowned. Later one of her killers, who had second thoughts about what he did, is murdered by his partner and then thrown into the East River. With the city medical examiner determining that Miss. Dexter's death was a homicide Lt. Muldoon & Det.Halloran, Barry Fitzgerald & Don Taylor, are put on the case. The police find a number of jewelry items in Jean's apartment that it turned out were stolen in a string of burglaries of people that she knew. Keying in on a Frank Niles(Howard Duff), who was one of Jean's close friends, who's stories about himself being a combat veteran and successful businessman turned out to be total hokum but his alibi about him being at a nightclub at the time of Jean's murder with his fianc\u00e9 Ruth Morrison, Dorothy Heart, checked out. later in an emotionally packed sequence at the City Morgue with Jean's parents Mr & Mrs Batory( Adeliade Kline & Grover Burgess) Mrs. Batory who hated her daughter, for changing her name to Dexter and leaving home and mixing with the crowd that lead to her murder, breaks down and sobs uncontrollably when she and her husband are shown Jean's body for them to make a positive identification. Niles in a panic pawns off a number of stolen jewels from friends of his and Jean that he somehow came into possession of that had the police, with Niles' fianc\u00e9 Ruth, go to his apartment just in time to stop him from being murdered, by Jean's murderer? As the frustrated would-be killer escapes by getting away on a city EL train. Confronted with the news of his lying and with the revelation of Niles engagement ring to Ruth being stolen from her mother and him having a plane ticket for him to skip out of the country to Mexico. Ruth, in another emotionally packed scene in the movie, break down in tears and then smacks the almost comatose Niles around so hard that Det. Halloran had to step in and stop her. The police get a big break in the Dexter murder case when Pete Backalis, Walter Burke, is found floating not far from Jean's apartment in the East River. It's determined that Backalis was killed just after Jean's murder and that he had a rap sheet of burglaries, just like the one at Jean's apartment, and worked with a fellow burglar named Willie Gazah, Ted De Corsia. The police putting all the pieces together connect Niles and Jean with the prominent physician and high society party-thrower Dr. Stoneman, House Jameson, who seems to have more then a passing acquaintance with her. Police detectives Muldoon & Halloran going to Dr.Stoneman office and taking Niels along with them. Dr. Stoneman when confronted with Niels and the news of Jean's murder in yet another emotionally charged scene in the movie, tearfully break down as the shocking truth comes out about his secret life as Jean's lover. As well as the person who tipped her off about the people who were to attend his and his wife's parties, so Jean's criminal associates can break into their homes and rob their jewelry. Dr. Stoneman reaching a state of total despair and having what seems like a complete emotional breakdown all at once attempts to jump out of his high-rise office window. Niels, who for once in his life did something good and heroic,stopped him just before he could get to the window ledge. Tracking down the elusive Garzah to his Lower East Side apartment Det. Halloran is knocked out by him when he realized that he's a cop instead a hospital worker who's checking on him about his friend Peter Backalis who Halloran tells him is alive but Garzah knows that Pete's dead because he murdered him. With the police dragnet slowly closing in on him Garzah takes off to the only avenue of escape left open to him the East River Williamsburg Bridge. Panicking when he collides on the bridges walk-path with a person who's blind, and then shoots his seeing-eye dog who attacked him, Garzah makes a run for it as the police are alerted, by the gunshot, and chase him to the bridge's Manhattan side tower. With nowhere for him to run, as the bridge is cut off on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides by the police, Garzah desperately climbs to the top and is shot in a blazing gun battle, when he refused to surrender. The killer falls to his death in a scene that made the Williamsburg Bridge almost as famous as the scene at the end of the movie \"King Kong\" that made the Empire State Building a piece of motion picture folklore. With the murder of Jean Dexter now solved, and out of the newspaper headlines and in the garbage can,the film ends with the now famous line: \"There Are Eight Million Stories In The Naked City; This Has Been ONE Of THEM\".",

The problem that arises with on-the-street filming is the post-dubbing. In order to get around synchronizing voices with lip movement, there are several instances of filming the speaker from the back. It's a forgivable sin.\n\nThe players are pretty much spot on. Barry Fitzgerald is an elf with twinkling eyes but still can bring believability to the role of the lead detective. Don Taylor is particularly good as his young partner and the scenes in his home are comfortable and realistic. Howard Duff is a real sleaze bag and is playing against type, since he usually portrayed a tough cop but again, its a forgivable sin. Ted DeCorsia, in his first featured role, is pretty much on target as the killer without conscience.\n\nWhat I have trouble with in the film is the intrusive voice-over by the producer Mark Hellinger.

With the end of WWII came the return of many film-makers like Producer-Narrator Mark Hellinger who had experience in shooting documentaries with all their realism during the war. Starting with The Naked City, noir saw the impact of combat photography in location shootings and gritty realism.\n\nThe Naked City, as narrated at the outset by the producer, was shot on location in New York in the apparently scorching summer of 1947. There are lots of scenes shot with hidden cameras, passersby unaware that a film was being shot. That would've created a significant impact at a time when everything was shot on set - and heavily stylized. In the present age, when nearly all outdoor shooting is 'on location', the impact of Naked City diminishes significantly. The plot plods along, the acting is generally wooden, although Barry Fitzgerald gives an interesting if over-acted performance. A lot of the authentic police procedural is too tame and dated compared to what one normally see on TV today.\n\nApart from the groundbreaking decision to shoot on location, the only other selling point of the film is the chase in the last 15 minutes of the movie. That was the bulk of the films outdoor shooting and its great. Its suspenseful, well shot and the narration works great. It reminded me of the great M by Fritz Lang. For serious noir fans, The Naked City has to be seen once, but its not a film to be revisited repeatedly like some of the earlier classics of the genre.",

Well, here, it's attempted and largely pulled off by director Jules Dassin with a down-to-earth almost documentary realism which fully involves the viewer in the action as the well-known tag-line \"1 of 8,000,000 stories\" (the murder of a pretty female immigrant who's fallen into bad company and criminal habits) is played out over a three-day period in a sunny summery New York cityscape. William Daniels' excellent photography captures a city constantly on the move with its own citizens as accidental extras and actual locations as would-be film-sets. Just as effective is the natural vernacular dialogue with some great one-liners thrown in - none better than Barry Fitzgerald seemingly admiring the rear view of a retreating beautiful female suspect with the remark to a junior colleague \"Beautiful long legs she has, wouldn't you say?\" to which the underling readily concurs only for old pro Fitzgerald to snap \"Keep them in sight for the next 48 hours!\" detailing a tail on her. There's also another great scene where the murdered girl's mother berates to all and sundry her dead daughter for her reckless lifestyle and bringing of shame onto her family right up until she is taken to identify the corpse where she breaks down uncontrollably, her maternal feelings restored. The murder tale is slightly convoluted but reasonably easy to follow, no contrived clever-clever plotting here, just an everyday relatively uncomplicated murder, solved by routine police work which makes the headlines due to the beauty of the victim. There's close attention paid to forensics and even the insertion of scenes where perennial sad hoaxers come forward to either claim to solve the murder or even confess to it. The acting is mostly good, Fitzgerald is dapper and spot-on as the world-weary 'tec and his supporting officers all acquit themselves well too. The playing however of some of the criminals gets a little overwrought at times and jars the mood slightly. The film arrives at a reasonably exciting conclusion high above Williamsburg Bridge before the city goes back to sleep awaiting its next story... All done and dusted in 90 very watchable minutes, this is a very entertaining film-blanc I suppose you'd have to call it.",

                "text": "The Naked City (1948)\n\nThere are 8 million stories in the naked city, we are told. This is one of them. A fairly standard plot, The Naked City pieces together an ensemble of cops navigating the labyrinth murder investigation of a young model. Lies are told, people are not who they seem. It's a real whodunnit, a real heavy case, as they say. Rookie homicide detective Jimmy Halloran (Taylor) is paired with the veteran Irish cop, Dan Muldoon (Fitzgerald). Together the two, along with the rest of the homicide squad slowly put the pieces together.\n\nThe film is set in a semi-documentary style, going on to inspire police procedurals from High and Low to NYPD Blue and various other cop and criminal TV shows. That is an immense credit to the film. Oddly though, the film is narrated, by we are told, the producer. He describes, among other things, that the film is directed by Jules Dassin. The narration is quite strange, and at times silly and off-putting. At other times it works brilliantly.\n\nEven by 1940s standards, The Naked City contains some very hammy acting and writing, that can be very frustrating and almost sent me into fits from time to time. Nevertheless, the film works despite itself, because of itself. Jules Dassin, one of the great film noir helmers, creates a visual representation of New York City that is not only breathtaking, but relentlessly nostalgic today. I found myself thinking about what a shame it is that the city is no longer looks this way to be captured on film anymore. Thankfully there are a multitude of other classic films which can appease my appetite for nostalgia. Few however, have managed to capture the city in such elegant a fashion as Dassin does here.\n\nAll in all, The Naked City is an admirable film, for its visuals, its hardboiled story, and for its remarkable finale. As a product of its time, its at once a great success, though the years may have not treated this one well. The acting, the narration, and some of the dialogue is almost self parody at times now. But nevertheless, The Naked City was a unique offering, one that has been so highly influential.",

                "text": "\nAn unrealized project of Alfred Hitchcock's was to make a movie about 24 hours in the life of a great city, probably New York.  Producer Mark Hellinger enlisted director Jules Dassin to attempt a similar stunt.  The result was The Naked City, a slice-of-life police procedural that served as template for the popular television series a decade later.  And while the movie is nowhere near the ground-breaking cinematic enterprise that Hellinger promises in his introduction and ceaseless voice-over narration, it's not negligible.  With its huge cast (many of them recognizable, even in mute or walk-on roles) and pioneering location shooting on the sidewalks of New York during the sweltering summer of 1947, it nonetheless continues to satisfy.  Its documentary aspect outlives its suspense plot.\n\nIt opens with two men chloroforming and then drowning a high-profile model in her city apartment (shades of I Wake Up Screaming and Laura).  When her cleaning lady finds her next morning, it falls to Detective Lieutenant Barry Fitzgerald, with his heather-honey lilt, and his principal investigator, Don Taylor, to fit the pieces together.  Soon into their web flits Howard Duff, an affable, educated loafer with no visible means of support who lies even when the truth would do him no harm.  It seems he was on cozy terms with the deceased, even though he's engaged to one of her co-workers (Dorothy Hart).  But although Duff's a poor excuse for a human being, nothing seems to stick to him, either.  So the police slog on through the broiling day and soupy night, knocking on doors and flashing pictures of the dead girl.  Their sleuthing takes them, and us, up and down the hierarchy of the city's eight million souls, from society dames and society doctors to street vendors and street crazies.  \n\nWhile the plot never rises out of the routine, these urban excursions give the movie its raffish texture \u0096 and remain one of its chief pleasures.  This was New York in the dawn of its post-war effloresence, a city where it was still common practice to live comfortably on modest \u0096 average \u0096 wages.  The gap between East Side apartments and Lower East Side walkups, with the bathtub in the kitchen, doesn't yet seem impossible to cross.  And its inhabitants burst on camera with a welter of accents and attitudes.  Hellinger and Dassin must have enlisted the services of every character-actor and bit-player in the Tri-State area, and film buffs will have a trivia tournament in trying to pick them out.\n\nThe Naked City ends with a chase over hot pavements and a stand-off high up on one of the bridges spanning the East River.  It's a great set-piece, of the sort that action movies are all but required to include, but the movie's strength proves more subtle \u0096 it lies in its collection of sharply drawn vignettes (some of them, to be sure, little more than sentimental shtik).  The Naked City is a rarity \u0096 a major production where the day players outshine the stars.",

                "text": "The late 1940s saw noirs moving away from Expressionism and toward crime dramas with a more pseudo-documentarian style. This resulted in films like \"Boomerang\", \"Detective Story\", \"The Naked City\", \"The Enforcer\", \"The House on 92nd Street\", \"Code 2\", \"The Blue Gardenia\", \"Street With No Name\" and \"Call Northside 777\", most of which eschewed private detectives and noir heroes and focused instead on newspaper reporters, lawyers, lowly cops, bureaucrats and journalists, all characters personally disinterested in the narratives being resolved. All professionals simply doing a job.\n\n\"The Naked City\", directed by Jules Dassin, isn't the best of these films, but it's perhaps the most influential. Shot on location in New York City, the film's title alludes, amongst other things, to Dassin's cinema verite style, New York laid bare, exposed, naked and raw. Such faux authenticity is commonplace today, but back in the 1940s, was a big deal. The result is Dassin's camera, which salivates over stolen shots of New York City, in which regular people go about their daily business, the city and its inhabitants proceeding as if unobserved. \"This is the city as it is,\" the film's narrator proudly says. \"The children at play, the buildings in their naked stone.\" The film is seriously pleased with its eavesdropping.\n\nEventually a story develops. A sexually promiscuous woman has been murdered, a crime upon which detectives Dan Muldoon and James Halloran are set loose. We follow them over the course of six days, watching as they do the leg work, trace leads and converge on their suspect. Audiences raised on TV crime dramas will be unimpressed, but such procedurals were novel back in the 1940s.\n\nLuckily the film ends with a bang, Dassin treating us to a long chase sequence in which cops chase a crook across Lower East Side tenements and then up the Williamsburg Bridge. This chase is merely a vehicle for showing off yet more of New York City, but Dassin directs with some style, his camera gliding through rich and poor neighbourhoods, along train tracks, up stairs and eventually up the iron latticeworks of the Williamsburg Bridge. \n\nThe film's coda then mirrors its opening portion, our narrator smugly reminding us that we have merely witnessed \"one of the city's 8 million tales\". Yes, we get it, the city is the star. The film is not a noir, but its contrast between the dreary ordinariness of a police procedural and the vast scale of New York nevertheless conjures up the existential lamentations of noir. \n\nIncidentally, a young Stanley Kubrick would often be on Dassin's set, taking photographs. Kubrick was himself heavily influenced by Dassin's film, his first noir, \"Killer's Kiss\", taking all the good parts from Dassin's work here and throwing away the fat. Shot on a shoestring, Kubrick's chase through New York's concrete jungles ably matches \"Naked's\" climactic chase. \"The Naked City\" also has other Kubrick connections. It was inspired by the work of New York photographer and photojournalist Arthur Fellig, also known as \"Weegee\". Himself a talented photographer, Kubrick was friends with Fellig, and hired him as a consultant and stills photographer when directing \"Dr Strangelove\". \n\n7.9/10 \u0096 Worth one viewing.",

The victim's apartment is very much a studio set, as is the police station, and their artificiality clashes with the exhilarating location footage. Also, much of the dialog and the overall acting styles, as well as the stock character of the \"Oi-rish\" cop played by Barry Fitzgerald, are straight out of thirties Hollywood. It can be very jarring at times. Fortunately, the film becomes more of a real police procedural toward the second half, and spends more time on real locations, culminating with the exciting chase above the East River. \"The Naked City\" is often called a classic because it changed the direction of American film-making, but on it's own merits it's a flawed classic.",

More significantly, however, it was also incredibly innovative and influential because, not only was it the first movie to be shot entirely on-location in New York City but also it's widely acknowledged as being the first movie to show in detail, the very routine nature of a police investigation. This effectively paved the way for all the police procedural films that followed and so its significance in cinema history is difficult to overstate.\n\nThe role that the city plays is enormous as its presence and characteristics are re-emphasised repeatedly throughout the film. The use of location shooting, views of the subways and non-professionals in some of the supporting roles, all add authenticity to the action and shots of children at play, street vendors and busy streets convey a strong sense of the vitality of the city and its relentless nature.\n\nWhen the dead body of a beautiful young woman is found in her apartment by her housekeeper, Detective Lieutenant Dan Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald) and his young partner, Detective Jimmy Halloran (Don Taylor) are assigned to the case. After the medical examiner confirms that Jean Dexter (who was a model), had been murdered, Muldoon questions the housekeeper, Martha Swenson (Virginia Mullen) about her employer's friends and this leads to Frank Niles (Howard Duff), Dr Lawrence Stoneman (House Jameson) and Ruth Morrison (Dorothy Hart) all being interviewed by the detectives.\n\nNiles had been one of the victim's ex-boyfriends who had since become engaged to Ruth Morrison. He proves to be an inveterate liar and further checks establish that he'd sold a gold cigarette case that had been stolen from Dr Stoneman and that his fianc\u00e9e's engagement ring had also been stolen. Dr Stoneman confirms that he had prescribed the sleeping tablets that had been found in the victim's apartment and Ruth Morrison, a model who'd worked with Dexter, is soon regarded as not being involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nFurther investigations reveal that Jean Dexter and Frank Niles had been involved in arranging jewellery thefts and that they had hired other criminals to actually carry out the robberies. This information then leads to the killer's identity and motive finally being discovered.\n\nThe police officers in this movie are depicted as being good humoured, scrupulously honest and not at all cynical. Muldoon is a very friendly and experienced detective who has spent most of his career dealing with homicide investigations and Barry Fitzgerald is amusing but also sometimes a little over-the-top in the way that he portrays this Irishman. Don Taylor is good in his role as Halloran who is Muldoon's very enthusiastic and well-meaning partner and Howard Duff provides some moments of humour in his excellent performance as the disreputable Niles who is unable to open his mouth without telling a series of lies. Ted de Corsia also makes a strong impression in his minor part as a harmonica-playing wrestler!\n\nProducer Mark Hellinger's narration is very dated but Jules Dassin's direction and the quality of William H Daniels' Oscar-winning cinematography are both very impressive. Another outstanding highlight of this film is the final chase sequence which is both exciting and brilliantly choreographed.",

A few scenes worthy of Detective Fiction, but the tone is so often abruptly changed back and forth that the result remains a rather light affair that seems to anticipate TV and its family friendly cop shows that were just around the turn of the next decade.\n\nSo, this is not film-noir and it is not even a down and dirty crime thriller.

The two murderers leave her in a full bathtub just to make sure but it is not long before one feels guilty for what he has done and is dispatched by the other. With the death of an attractive young woman in a mid-town apartment the media grab hold of it quickly and Detective Lieutenant Dan Muldoon quickly feels the pressure to process this crime with young Detective Jimmy Halloran doing the leg work.\n\nIt is interesting to look back on this film through the eyes of someone who loves Homicide and The Wire because this film's main selling point appears to be that it was shot on location across New York and in a realistic, semi-documentary style. Although it has dated slightly over the years and by way of comparison of the aforementioned realistic modern series, Naked City still works by feeling like it is set within the real world, albeit a \"real world\" that doesn't resemble ours as much as modern films do. It helps that it is set in NYC and so the setting at least is visually representative of the place we all know, even if the attitudes are different.\n\nThe narrative follows a murder case investigation in a way that does justice to the reality. Personally I found it a little slow and the plot to be a bit expansive considering the boast of being realistic but the way the case is built is engaging and producing a convincing drama. The irony is that the reality feels a lot less gritty than the studio-set noir films where they can create atmosphere with lighting and the set, but regardless it is still a solid drama. The cast works well enough for the material although I'll be honest and say that Fitzgerald's accent was distracting even if I recognise that it may have been the truth in the day. Otherwise he is pretty solid and works well with the younger Taylor. Duff, Hart and others are also good but I must admit I found the narration to be a bit heavy handed but I suspect it was a device employed because the makers feared the approach would lose the audience without hand-holding.\n\nOverall, a solid drama that benefits from locations and characters that come off as real and living. The narrative could have benefited from being a bit smaller in scale but more realistic story but was still enjoyable and engaging for what it was.",

But they all were specifically trying to make something even more stunning than what came before, and \"The Naked City\" is probably what many of them had in mind when they thought of what preceded their work.\n\nIn that regard, it's fascinating to go back and see the original model, even if it doesn't quite have the shocking flourishes of today's cop drama. \"The Naked City\" tells its story very well, and at times the well-written narration will have even the hardened crime drama buff feeling quite excited, even riveted.\n\nIt's a simple enough story, with only lip service done to the \"cop's home life\" subplot that's always been a hallmark of the cop drama, and the core story actually benefits from its simplicity.

Jules Dassin's 'The Naked City (1948)' is a fair Hollywood attempt at blending the styles of neorealism and film noir, both of which were at the time only beginning to receive due recognition. At first glance, the two movements appear to sit at opposite ends of the stylistic and ideological spectrum: film noir typically concerns the fate of ordinary men trapped in exceptional circumstances, whereas Italian neorealism presents its characters' struggles as decidedly unremarkable, representative of the societal norm. Where these two particular films converge is in emphasising the invisibility of drama in real-life. De Sica's bicycle-seeking protagonists, dejected and beaten, disappear amid the crowds of workers. In his desperate flight from the authorities, Dassin's Willie Garzah (Ted de Corsia) carves a destructive path through the crowds of New Yorkers, but the city schedule is disrupted only briefly.\n\nUnderpinning 'The Naked City' is producer Mark Hellinger's narration, which serves as both a prop and a vice. Absolutely essential is the final sign-off, which remarks \"there are eight million stories in the Naked City. This has been one of them.\" Coming only moments after a murderer falls to his death from the Williamsburg Bridge, this narration assures us, as critic Luc Sante writes in his Criterion Collection essay, \"that what we briefly experienced as a cosmic struggle up above the earth was really just another statistic.\" In a city of eight million people, such high-drama attains only passing significance: workers file past the apartment building where a young model was brutally murdered; children play jump-rope outside the office window of a detective embroiled in a homicide case; a street-sweeper cleans up yesterday's discarded newspaper, its headline \"DEXTER MURDER SOLVED!\" having since given way to more pertinent news. However, Hellinger's narration, which chimes in at regular intervals, can also be intrusive, and I disliked the cheerful, cloying manner in which it interacted with the characters, as in a contemporary newsreel.\n\nDespite revolving around a police procedural that has many of the classic dramatic ingredients \u0096 most memorably a suave jewel thief and pathological liar (Howard Duff) \u0096 it is only when detectives Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald) and Halloran (Don Taylor) take to the streets that 'The Naked City' really springs to life. Dassin filmed most of his exteriors out in the gritty urban walkways, often without the knowledge of bystanders, and the resultant atmosphere is fundamental to his storytelling style. New York simply seems so real, bustling with the minor details of activity \u0096 children playing in the streets, salesmen pushing their carts \u0096 that are impossible to duplicate on a studio backlot. However, rather than serving merely as a documentary portraiture of city life, as in Vertov's 'The Man with a Movie Camera (1929),' the film's authentic environment instead functions to solidify the immediacy of the underlying drama. While Dassin's ability to juggle these disparate elements at times appears strained, he would perfect his method for what is, for my money, the director's masterpiece: 'Night and the City (1950).'",

The criminals are closer to the realistic criminals one sees in the world not the criminals that get rounded up in the parlor and are made to confess like in so many Hollywood mysteries of earlier eras.\n\nFrom the opening aerial view you know immediately that this is like no other movie made before it. We see the city when it's late at night and most people are asleep and when crime is most likely to happen. We also see the city awake and commuters are going to work. The director Jules Dassin, takes us along with the cops walking down actual crowded NY city streets following leads. I like how the onlookers had to be held back as they try to see anything pertaining to a headline making case. Take any murder case in your city that lands on the front page and you'll see rubberneckers standing by and this movie shows that. Of course the climactic scene had to take place on one of the city's bridges, the Williamsburg bridge I believe.\n\nThe early scenes of the investigation shows us early scientific methods of investigations. Think of it as CSI the early years. Some of the methods haven't changed much like the finger prints and consulting the Medical Examiner with the Cause Of Death. Then the movie becomes police investigation part of \"Law & Order\". In fact the producers of L & O must have blueprinted much of their investigation from this film. We see suspects and witness being questioned and then we see layers of deceit slowly unfold. It really holds one's interest as guilty party or parties are methodically revealed. Clever fans of L&O will probably figure things out earlier than I did.\n\nIn many of the early murder mysteries, particularly the old gather everyone in the parlor so we can expose the guilty person kind of mysteries, the guilty person is after just one person. This movie have more in common like the other films noir of the 40s. We see criminals ruthless enough to take what they want and are not afraid to go and get it no matter who's in the way. And if you're in the way be prepared to get lost or be prepared to meet your maker. The ruthlessness of the criminals might not be shocking to anyone today but in the 1940s I'm pretty sure it made people take pause.\n\nOn the whole the acting was great. Barry Fitzgerald played LT. Muldoon and he played the character very well, although I have to say his Irish accent really got in the way early on but his commitment to the part just made you forget about his accent. Don Taylor, the young detective who was partnered with Muldoon, at first seem aloof. Eventually he grew on me. I remember Mr. Taylor as Lt. Dunbar in \"Stalag 17\" and I thought he was unconvincing in that role and disliked him. Here I have to say he was very good and he's won me over. The most recognizable member of the cast is probably Howard Duff who plays a charming cad. He really didn't display much charm, I wouldn't say he was wooden but more tense than he needed to be.\n\nSharp eyed film fans who appreciated great characters will spot Kathleen Freedman and James Gregory. Mr. Gregory in fact had only one scene but it was pivotal.\n\nAll in all I think this movie will please movie fans, especially those who are big fans of film noir and police procedural.",

                "text": "\"There are eight million stories in New York City,\" intones the narrator, \"and this is just one of them.\" Not all stories are as gripping as this one, though. The Naked City is a tough-as-nails detective noir (there are two murders in the first five minutes) from Jules \"Rififi\" Dassin, and it delivers all the suspicion, salaciousness, and shooting one could hope for \u0096 albeit not much more.\n\nAs with his previous film, the prison drama Brute Force, Dassin is plunging us into a brutal underworld, although this time we're watching events from the perspective of the cops, led by Lieutenant Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald), as they investigate the murder of a female model. Suspects come and go, with some really dodgy ones thrown in as red herrings, before the culprit takes his pursuers on a tour of New York landmarks.\n\nClaiming to present the city \"as it is\", Dassin shot the film largely without sets, giving the exterior scenes in particular an unusual (for 1948) sense of authenticity. The same can't be said of the performances, which are wildly melodramatic at times, although in the lead role Fitzgerald brings a typically wicked dry wit.\n\nThe script might lack the sharpness of a true classic such as Double Indemnity, and the dialogue could have done with some hard boiling by the likes of Jim \"The Killing\" Thompson, but the film ebbs and flows admirably, daring to portray detective work as an imperfect science. For every revelation or clue there's a mad man or woman claiming they killed Jean Dexter. At one point the investigation comes to a shuddering halt as the men claw for leads. But it's all in the service of a tremendous third act, which ramps up the pace, and leads to a brilliantly composed chase 'em up finale, of which a certain Mr Hitchcock would have been proud.\n\nWhat stops The Naked City from matching Hitch's finest work is a lack of anything to really distinguish it from the crowd. The absurdly verbose narrator pushes the idea that it is, in a sense, the ugly city itself that's killed beautiful Jean, but it's a theme that never fully convinces in what we're actually shown. The film does come to life in a handful of individual scenes \u0096 such as a visit to the mortuary, where Jean's mother decries her daughter before crying for her; or a confrontation with a rabbit-punching ex-wrestler \u0096 but overall there's little here not done before, bar a documentary-style conceit hardly plundered.\n\n\"It's a heavy case,\" we're told more than once, and it's a heavy film. Unsentimental and intensely talky (until that last act), it's a well-constructed, if ultimately unremarkable, police procedural in which to sink on a Sunday afternoon.",

He showed up most often as a supporting player in his long career, but he played the key part of the experienced policemen well.\n\nAnyone who enjoys crime dramas will enjoy this movie. It gives you a real good snap shot of life all over New York City in that post war time period and meticulously documents street-level police investigative procedure. The lead in shot over the city must have inspired the almost identical shot used in West Side Story some years later.\n\nThe story involves the murder of a single woman in an apartment. Suspicion initially settles on one of her male suitors who implicates himself by a string of lies he tells the police. Later on, the detectives discover a connection to a burglary ring which leads them to the actual killer.\n\nIn the end, you get exactly what you expect from a 1940s cop movie. The Hayes Code was still observed at that time, and one of the cardinal rules of the day was that you could not show the law defeated. Naked City gives you that moralistic ending. The police inevitably catch up with the real killer, and the immorality of the people caught up in the criminal plot is exposed.\n\nThis film is not exactly film noir, but admittedly that's a subjective statement. It's real close in tone and subject matter, so you wouldn't be wrong in adding it to your film noir library. Enjoy this movie and spend some time in Hollywood's classic era!",

We are introduced to those who are working the third shift in a city that never sleeps. We know that we are not seeing a studio, for the \"actors\" \u0096 those who populate the great city of New York \u0096 are eventually observed in apartments, skyscrapers, factories, restaurants, coffee shops, parks, docks, and sidewalks. The city is hot in the summer. During the beginning narration, an unconscious blonde model is being murdered at the young age of 26 years. Within four hours, one of the two murderers kills the other and throws his body into the river. A few hours after that, the cleaning lady enters Miss Dexter's apartment, sees the body in a bathtub, and screams. Now our story takes hold. The police are quickly on the scene, and the newspapers follow. Before long the police examiner determines that the promiscuous woman's death was not by accident or suicide, but by homicide.\n\nSoon the lawmen discover that the dissolute woman was part of a jewel burglary ring that targeted the rich folks. Frank Niles, disreputable and a pathological liar, and Jean Dexter were part of the set-ups. Also a famous doctor is involved. In reality this film is a routine detective story. It involves the somewhat tedious but difficult \u0096 and sometimes dangerous \u0096 police work of investigation, of gathering information and piecing it all together. But the detectives and police are dedicated heroes who do their jobs with little complaint. It all comes down to a climax that involves an exciting city-wide dragnet for the arch-killer. Unfortunately for him, he is unable to board an overcrowded bus that would have taken him away from the targeted area. A panicked gunshot at a seeing-eye dog alerts police, and the ending occurs at the Williamsburg Bridge in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Case closed.\n\nAs for Jean Dexter, \"her name, her face, her history were worth five cents a day for six days.\" Now, with the case over, the old newspapers lying in the streets are cleaned up by the city trash men. Dexter is soon forgotten by virtually all, for there are eight million other stories brewing. A very few, including Dexter's grief-stricken parents, will never forget. The next day another story will reach the headlines, and our police heroes will be ready to solve another crime.\n\nAlhtough Muldoon spearheads the investigation, he is assisted by Jimmy Halloran (Don Taylor); there are other detectives, like Constantino and Perelli, although they have lesser roles. The Irish brogue of Barry Fitzgerald (Det. Lt. Dan Muldoon) can be a bit overpowering, but the pint-sized detective does deliver his lines with knowledge and charm. And is he shrewd! Howard Duff plays sleaze Frank Niles, and Ted DeCorsia is a wicked Willie Garzah. The film's producer, Mark Hellinger, narrates.\n\nShot on location on New York City streets in secret, and semi-documentary in style, the film is ground-breaking. It was obviously the inspiration of the later TV series, \"Naked City\" (1958-1963), and even \"Dragnet\" before that. The black and white photography is so good that the movie earned an Academy Award. Another award was won for film editing. While the old-time life of the city has changed, many of the police procedures seen are obviously in use today. If the plot seems standard or if the story appears boring at times, remember that detailed police procedure works the same way: constant probing, questioning, checking, and rechecking. Much less often does it consist of high speed chases and slam-bang shoot-outs. Who is the real hero of the story? Why the personality of the city of New York, of course!",

And that is the biggest appeal of the picture (I was born and raised there so I may be biased). Some interior shots appear to have been filmed on a sound stage, but the bulk of it is on location. For example, there is a scene filmed in lower Manhattan near Rivington and Norfolk streets. It show's a bustling, thriving \"family\" neighborhood with well dressed folks and kids playing in the neighborhood. It looks nothing like that now - just a place to pass through to get to somewhere else (though there is a school there now - check google maps and find the intersection - you can see the same building in the opening shot for that scene).\n\nStory-wise, it's a pretty solid film especially considering how dated movies from this period can be. There appears to be a real attempt to make the movie as accurate as possible and goes out of its way to include the methods used in solving modern crimes such as forensics - probably a novelty at the time.

Two men whose faces we cannot see kill a young woman in a bathtub. The rest of the story centers on a Manhattan cop, Lt. Dan Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald), and his \"homicide squad\", as they try to solve the murder.\n\nThe film is a little unusual for its time period in that most crimes in 1930s and 1940s crime films were solved by cerebral private detectives, like Sam Spade or Charlie Chan. Cops were peripheral, and portrayed as rather bumbling. But in \"The Naked City\", there is no private detective. It's the city police who, through laborious hard work, make efforts to solve the crime. The film is basically a police procedural.\n\nThe story's underlying premise is not especially interesting. It's the plotting, showing the leg work of the cops that keep the film moving along, interspersed with some eccentric minor characters that create entertainment for viewers.\n\nWhat really hurts this film is the narration by its producer, Mark Hellinger. In voice over, he introduces viewers to the film; he gives us progress reports; he talks to the characters along the way. At one point he tells viewers: \"The day's work is over now. People are on their way home. They're tired; they're hot; they're hungry. In the newspapers there's a new murder story.\" And then later, he tells us: \"It's 7:30 in the evening now. It's been a great day on the Dexter case. Developments? None. New clues? None. Progress? None.\" That watch-along-with-Mark gimmick might have been \"cute\" in 1948. Today, it's just tacky.\n\nProbably the best element is the B&W cinematography. The nighttime scenes outdoors, with the high-contrast side lighting, really give the film a most pleasant noir look and feel. And daytime outdoor shots occur on location in Manhattan, giving us a sense of realism. Unaware they're in a film, real New Yorkers go about their business, as the film's characters walk, or chase other characters.\n\n\"The Naked City\" isn't really a thriller or suspense film, though elements of those genres occur in some sequences. The film is mostly a police drama. The visuals look quite dated. The narration is super annoying. Acting is average.

Last time, I found this to be a clunker, a methodical and slightly quirky crime flick, pre-CSI, with lots of insider views of the police station. It has a likable and prominent narrator (one of the producers, actually) who not only tells much of the story but adds a sense of humor. He also creates a sense of detachment, because he'll comment as if we are in a viewing gallery and the detectives and criminals are on a stage for us to watch and chat about while they go about their business.\n\nThis time I was just rivetted by the location shooting, and if the plot was sometimes a bit routine, it didn't matter. I just wanted to see New York post-war. And it's not like the movie makers didn't know this--they make a point of the location stuff in the beginning comments. This really is the writing on the wall for the industry--moving from studio shooting to location stuff in the early and mid 1950s. For this alone the movie is kind of astonishing--it goes way beyond other location shooting like that in \"On the Waterfront\" and other turning point Hollywood hits (with bigger budgets).\n\nBut the plot? Well, it is largely told to us, not only in narration but in a sense of the characters having discoveries that change the direction of the events that we have no clue about. That is, we aren't able to get involved, get scared, even get surprised. Or in my case, interested. I was curious, but impatient and bored. \n\nSo why is the movie a small legend, getting high ratings and the Criterion company DVD treatment (reserved for special films)? I think mostly because of the vivid location work. It gives a pretty real sense of post-War Manhattan, and in fact is supposed to be an echo of newspaper photographer Weegee's images of the city, which had been published in his famous book of the same title in 1945. But Weegee didn't really deal with ordinary New York, as this does. He found the sensational, the tawdry, the bloody. He has pictures of decapitated heads and homeless women and people sleeping on the fire escape to avoid the heat and criminals getting booked.\n\nEven this last example makes the movie look pale at times. It has a \"documentary\" feel but it's like the photography of feel-good magazine, a Saturday Evening Post version of New York. Which isn't to say the movie isn't filmed well--the cinematographer William H. Daniels won an Oscar for this work (and was Garbo's favorite cameraman). The photography here has an amazing range of scenes and a variety of moods to convey. \n\nAnd the fabulous, brief ending on the Williamsburg Bridge is a tour-de-force all around, letting you forgive any shortcomings getting there.",

In what is dubbed as the bathtub murder, an investigation is opened, lead by veteran New York Lieutenant, Dan Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald). Frank Niles (Howard Duff) and Ruth Morrison (Dorothy Hart), are brought in to help with the investigation.They knew Dexter. As the lies, deceits and criminal activity are exposed through the people that occupied her life, a deep realisation that she too was incognito with the criminal underworld becomes apparent.\n\nShot on location in New York by Jules Dassin, this film noir adds something quite different to the average film of this genre. The usual laconic narration that is ordinarily spoken by the lead character, is, in The Naked City, spoken by the actual producer of this film. Mark Hellinger narrates the multitude of New York vignettes, and offers clues and speculation to the police procedural that follows the murder. The fact that also all the scenes were shot on location is quite an achievement for the time. This lends a certain documentary feel to the outcome. The cinematography is startling also because of this 'realism' (shot by William H. Daniels, for which he won an Academy Award).\n\nThe narrator offers insights into the everyday life of New Yorkers. He closes by stating that there are 4 million stories in New York; and this is one of them. This device was clearly lifted by Spike Lee in his 1999 film Summer of Sam. The influence of the film is also echoed in any film that was shot in New York this film most certainly is a document for that city that never sleeps. Much of the film is dialogue-heavy. But this need for exposition is essential in this kind of story. Perhaps not the greatest known (or even greatest) of the film noir cycle, but certainly one that broke ground in its ability to represent a certain reality within its frame.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

Initially, it seems to be a suicide, but once a coroner confirms that it was a murder, detectives Dan Muldoon and Jimmy Halloran embark on an investigation in search for the young female's murderer\u0085 \n\nDespite being auspicious and seemingly ripe at the time of its release, the movie looks rotten as well as antiquated nowadays owing to its contrived and artificial voice-over, which is supposedly intended to convey a documentary-like impression, old-fashioned acting and dissipated narrative structure. The director strives to infuse a downright realistic relish into the film by recounting a typical police crime case, yet he does not succeed on account of a vagabond trajectory of the flick. Dassin vacillates between delineating the silhouette of the city of New York and the main concept which is insipidly pedestrian and it would be obnoxiously humdrum without its background provided by the already exasperatingly forced voice-over. What the motion picture is deprived of is its authenticity and a strong textural spine, but most of all an adequate stylisation which would enable the material to capture the harsh and gritty reality of everyday life in NY, whilst the pic divides the city into two fractions \u0096 good and bad dwellers minus making allowances for the humans who are neither awfully decent nor particularly unlikable. Instead of contemplating the disparate tones of human nature in the urban jungle, Dassin lunges the plot in a lacklustre, monotonous manner, plunges into redundant digressions, never delving into character's psyche which could render the psychologically sterile and superficial panorama more colourful and engaging.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald is one of the rare performers whose acting does not appear bogus or excessively physical. He certainly portrays the experienced detective Muldoon plausibly forasmuch he behaves in a loose way as though he was genuinely a skilled, self-confident and smug policeman. Don Taylor is deft, but he fades in comparison with Fitzgerald who gives the best performance in the film. The remainder of the cast is unremarkable.\n\nThe cinematography by William H. Daniels conjures up a ravishing d\u00e9cor and it is one of the biggest merits of this movie. Even if some aspects fail to impress, the visuals are undoubtedly very imposing, exposing numerous locations in New York in an extraordinary way.\n\nThe Naked City does not come up to one's expectations owing to its unevenness, but it is comprehensible why it aroused some exultation among its audience on the day of its premiere. The flick was to display a stark reality of urban life, but what might have been subversive then, it looks very dull now.",

It was realistic where most preceding noirs had been expressionist; this approach actually adds to the excitement; on the other hand, the constant narration and the treatment of police officers' domestic lives are the aspects which have perhaps dated the most.\n\nThe film deservedly won cinematography and editing Oscars, but should have also been a contender in most top categories as well \u0096 such as Picture, Direction, Actor (Barry Fitzgerald) and Script. THE NAKED CITY, therefore, was very influential and much imitated \u0096 including one in which Fitzgerald had a similar role, UNION STATION (1950; which, consequently, I revisited the very next day) \u0096 and features a justly celebrated climactic chase and a legendary final line that's actually a cheat. The investigation of the central murder case also helped solve another (the killer's own associate) as well as a series of robberies involving Howard Duff (who had been one of the desperate prisoners in director Dassin and producer Mark Hellinger's previous noir, BRUTE FORCE [1947]) \u0096 described by Fitzgerald as the worst liar he has come across in his long years of service! \n\nPint-sized Irish character actor Barry Fitzgerald really nails his part of Detective Muldoon \u0096 bringing a mix of authority, warmth and humor to the otherwise grueling (and often frustrating) investigation; it's also interesting that the case is cracked by the inexperienced assistant (Don Taylor) who, on a hunch, decided to follow a trifling lead. The scene involving an eccentric old lady \u0096 who turns up at the police station claiming to be able to help, but whose contribution is totally worthless \u0096 may well have inspired Thelma Ritter's Oscar-nominated role of an elderly (albeit shrewd) police informer in Samuel Fuller's gritty noir PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET (1953). The film also features several noted character actors in small roles \u0096 I recognized Paul Ford, James Gregory, Arthur O'Connell and David Opatoshu, but the IMDb mentions Kathleen Freeman, Nehemiah Persoff and John Randolph as well\u0085while Stanley Kubrick is said to have served behind-the-scenes as a stills photographer!

The Naked City is a semi-documentary take on the investigation of crime within an urban metropolis. The documentary elements are secondary to the central theme; and that is nothing but a good thing if you ask me, as the last time I saw a noir film with documentary elements was the less than completely successful 'The Street with No Name' (coincidentally also released in 1948), which was brought down by it's constant FBI advertisements. Jules Dassin fuses his story with the handling well, however, and neither side of the film ever ends up interfering with the other. The film takes place in and around New York City, and the story begins with the murder of a blonde model in her apartment - apparently part of a robbery. The film then follows two police detectives on the case of the murder, and the way that they tie up the connection with it and the robbery.\n\nDirector Jules Dassin does a good job of capturing his central location, and New York City provides a good place for a story like this to take place. Noir is famous for its dark picture, and the director also does well in providing that, and this is a dark and gritty film throughout. The story has obvious implications of crime and murder, which bodes well with both the atmosphere and location. The story works mainly due to it's characters and most of them are well done and interesting enough; although if you ask me, Barry Fitzgerald's Irish detective is a little too comical, and as the comedy moments are often awkwardly implemented given the plot; he does the film no favours. The voice-over narration is one of the major points of the film, as it helps to tell the story and bodes well with the documentary style of the movie. The plot never gets too deep, and therefore is mostly played out for entertainment value. It seems obvious that Dassin was more interested in the technical elements of the film; as the plot comes second - but overall, this is a fine noir film and comes recommended to fans.",

But in spite of the spirited intention, producers probably wisely thought there has to be a crime for the audience to follow. Even Italians in their neorealism had to have a stolen bicycle, the ruins alone wouldn't do. The crime story is neither exceptional nor uninteresting, at any rate it is the thread that takes us through lives and places, wonderful places. It is thanks to that to and fro that we visit hairdressers and pharmacists, East Side and Staten Island neighborhoods.\n\nA few things about the placement of the eye. What is real is continuously reconstituted as we are by the worlds we create, always becoming. A Tony Scott film would have been fundamentally incomprehensible to a 1860s audience. So now the camera seems stagy, always cleanly framing the movement. The situations too, cleanly framing 'for' the camera a joke, a reaction or a witticism. Curiously, a narrator walks us through the film, and even narrates for the everyman on the street\u0097forcing clean thoughts. (basically, everything about this narrator's position is odd and deserves deep inspection)\n\nShadows would change every one of these things in ten years time.\n\nCassavetes burrowed deep, his principle was that the integration of life around the eye decides. What is real, really seen, is a matter of finetuning the perception of the encounter, a dynamic process. In other words, it's not a realistic shot alone but the emerging view. Now this wasn't the first film of this sort, twenty years earlier a guy called Mamoulian had shot on location in Manhattan. Wonderful film, his Applause. But stringent melodrama in the plot. From Applause to this to Shadows, it's largely the understanding of life that changes.\n\nDassin in Rififi, his first exilic movie, would silence this omniscient American narrator-god who can dictate peoples' thoughts for them.\n\nAnd isn't the understanding a matter of invention? In order to get the shots of New York streets, Dassin had to film with a hidden camera, still an issue. Taking a camera to people is like throwing a rock to study birds in their natural state, the presence of the eye fundamentally scares the real. To get around this, Dassin had to stage artifice: sometimes a juggler would distract crowds, sometimes a man was hired to climb on a post and wave a flag while giving patriotic speeches! Forgery, all so he could capture life unaware. I think this so very amusing and cool.\n\nBut in its intended reach, seeing is as though it was new, the movie must have had the effect of an early Scorsese film in the 70s. Still a movie, but the situations, streets and character lives are a little more real than usual by Hollywood standards.\n\nIf now the template seems so familiar, TV is to blame. Sure enough, this was made into a TV cop show, many more followed in this vein. Which may be a potent explication of the TV effect, realism becomes template, passage becomes handle. A TV series broadcasts not an original world so much as the habitual life. I hear this is changing these days, which makes me wonder just what is being turned into template?\n\nNoir Meter: 2/4",

It's main claim to fame is the fact that it was shot entirely on location in New York City in 1948 and this fact was rammed home again and again. Setting aside the claim - as far back as 1931, for example, Julien Duvivier shot Les Cinq gentlemen maudits on location in Morocco and several other films - Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend to name one - had featured isolated scenes shot on location - the film holds up surprisingly well - I've just watched it on DVD 51 years after its initial release. Perhaps significantly the studio weren't prepared to send any really BIG stars to Manhattan so the only actual 'names' were Barry Fitzgerald and Howard Duff, neither capable of, as we say today, 'opening' a film without a gimmick attached. Having said that Fitzgerald, a veteran scene-stealer in supporting roles, is excellent as the homicide detective faced with a new murder to solve and Duff, as one of the main suspects, is as good as the role permits him to be. It must have been novel in 1948 for a film that wasn't directed by Orson Welles to play out its entire running time without a single credit albeit we have the narration of Producer Mark Hellinger talking us through every development. For viewers weaned on CSI it may seem risible to see the crude detecting methods available in 1948, on the other hand the case was solved and solved believably. Buffs will revel in the host of actors who pop up more or less uncredited - Paul Ford, James Gregory, Arthur O'Connell, Molly Picon, for example, whilst another well-known minor villain, Ted De Corsia, makes his debut as the real murdered and and equally spectacular exit from the Williamsburg Bridge.

At one point in the story, Sheriff Rob Saunders (Jock Mahoney) was about to arrest his father (Edgar Dearing) and put him in jail when suddenly the Durango Kid knocks the sheriff out and brings the father to jail! What??!! \n\nWell stuff like this happens a lot in these old time Western flicks and I've learned pretty much to just go with it, but that was one of the more unusual ones. Backing up a bit, this is one of those stories involving water rights and who controls what and how is the hero going to resolve things favorably for all those concerned. Actually, even though this is a Durango Kid picture, it's his alter-ego Steve Brandon that does most of the investigative work and makes the final save to close out the story. Charles Starrett handles a very athletic stunt near the end of the picture where he leaps head first through a cabin window, does a somersault and gets the drop on bad guy Burch (Chuck Roberson). Very cool.\n\nAs is often the case in a Durango Kid movie, Smiley Burnette shows up to help out, this time in the guise of a traveling bathtub salesman. For those who aren't familiar with Smiley, he usually rode a horse named Ring Eye, because the horse had a ring around his eye. Not a natural one of course, it was a painted circle around the horse's right eye. Well the gimmick is extended here as Smiley rides into town with two horses pulling his bathtub wagon, and both have ring eyes. He calls them Ma and Pa, but later on when he needs them to giddy-up, he calls them Bill and Mort, so I don't know how that would work.\n\nThere's another gimmick more central to the story in which the general storekeeper Norton (Raymond Bond), who's calling the shots for the bad guys, tricks out his Colt .45 frame with a .41 caliber chamber. I don't know enough about guns to know if that's possible or not, but it sounded good enough to be a foolproof way to kill a few adversaries and get away with it by pinning it on the only guy in town who owned a .41 caliber. Of course Brandon/Durango has this all under control and figured out in plenty enough time to make the save.\n\nYou know what I was really waiting for though; I was real curious about how much Smiley was charging for his bathtubs. In the 1973 Western flick \"Kid Blue\", Warren Oates buys one of them new fangled steel bathtubs for $12.99 (without freight charges). Smiley's were porcelain lined so that might have gone for a couple more bucks, but sad to say, we just don't ever get to find out.",

It was produced by Jack Wrather who also produced the TV series.\n\n Essentially a \"B+\" western it is nonetheless a well mounted production.

The Masked Man and his faithful Indian companion ride in to try and prevent the conflict.\n\n Moore and Silverheels, who had been around the \"B\" movie scene since the late 30s, play their parts pretty much the way they did on TV but with a little more edge.

Perhaps it's had its origins of such a pairing from The Lone Ranger, or so I'd like to believe. After having spent some time with old martial arts classics, I thought I'd set my sights on the western genre, and what more appropriate than the adventures of the legendary Lone Ranger astride his steed Silver, and his Red Indian sidekick Tonto.\n\nFor those not in the loop of this character, he's like the daytime vigilante of the Wild Wild West, in his mask concealing his true identity, and loads his guns with silver bullets. The silver bullet also functions as a calling card of sorts, and come to think of it, it's like a friendlier version of Batman, only in a different setting. And with that theme music - William Tell Overture - blaring in the background as they ride into the sunset, it's pure nostalgia. Not hard to imagine that I actually grew up on such stuff.\n\nThe movie begins by diving right into the story, with our heroes up against some mean and corrupt and greedy cattle ranchers who are after more land, and some bad hats amongst them trying to stir up war with the Native Americans. So it's up to our heroes to expose the truth, and to prevent bloodshed. That pretty much sums up the gist of the plot.\n\nAlthough this is not an origin movie, the beginnings of how the Lone Ranger came about was mentioned in passing - His brother and himself, both Rangers, were ambushed by outlaws and left for dead. But Fate has Tonto rescuing the Ranger, and he decided to use the clothes of his dead brother to make a mask, to stay mysterious, to be feared by the villains he hunted down. The origins of Silver, his mighty loyal steed, is also mentioned, but more to the effect that it was nursed back to health by the Ranger himself.\n\nGiven that this was made in the 50s, you'd come to expect some very stilted and stiff dialogues, as heroes in those days, are expected to be squeaky clean. You probably can't find a speck of dirt on the Ranger's character, as he embodies everything that is good, with that All American feeling. Called the \"trusty scout' (Kemo Sabe) by his Red Indian ally Tonto, the movie also takes a look at the prejudices faced by the Native Americans amongst groups of white men, and the strong partnership between our leads, is testament to the fact that ignorance and the lack of understanding, isn't the way to go.\n\nThe visual transfer isn't all that great, and it looks like it's VHS based, with little remastering done to remove the cacks and pops. The colours were inconsistent at times, and although it comes in both full screened and wide screened versions on the same disc, it isn't anamorphic.\n\nThe DVD extras are on a second disc, and has two sections. The first section contains interviews, while the rest goes into \"Special Features\".\n\nThere are two interviews included, and the first is with Michael Ansara, who plays Angry Horse. Interviewed by Michael Druxman (writer/director of The Doorway 1999), this interview fell short in quality as Ansana wasn't too chatty, and Druxman was chatting most of the time like a fanboy. Nothing much comes out of this interview, although a trivia was shared that the Lone Ranger actually never kills anybody on screen. Running at 17mins and 15 secs, I would recommend going straight for the second interview instead.\n\nThe second interview has more substantial material discussed, and it's natural given that it's conducted by Leonard Maltin of Entertainment Tonight, with the guest Dawn Moore, daughter of the Lone Ranger himself Clayton Moore. Conducted and recorded on 9 Feb 2001 and clocking in at 39 minutes, it is a heartfelt session with recollection of memories of Clayton Moore, about her childhood and growing up with the legend, many behind the scenes discussion at the production, anecdotes shared that only a child will know, and even talk about Silver the horse. Given her account, you'll be amazed at how hard Clayton Moore actually worked for the character, in character, in publicity that the company wanted him to do. This is a gem that all fans should give a listen to.\n\nThe Special Features section contains the following, though nothing in particular stands out: a. Text biographies of main cast and director Stuart Heisler b. A photo gallery with colour and black and white movie stills c. Trailers for The Lone Ranger, The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold, and trailers for two non Lone Ranger, but Western, films - Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting (both starring Jack Nicholson) d. A text writeup on The Lone Ranger Creed, which is also available on the insert.",

                "text": "It's a shame that this film is not more widely known and available, because it represents the pinnacle of the Lone Ranger, at least the on-screen version. In addition to being the Lone Ranger's zenith, it also ranks among the Greatest Super-Hero Films of All Time, and is very good Western in its own right.\n\nThe TV series (which, BTW, I loved) was always hampered by shooting schedule and budget, so location filming, riding scenes, fight scenes, etc., were always kept to a minimum. And usually the sets always looked as if they were constructed in 3 hours by the technicians at a local TV station in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBut in this film, besides being in color and having lots of outdoors scenes, there are plenty of great riding and fight scenes, including a full blown stampede. Best of all, both the Masked Man and Tonto each get to do a full-blown, knock-down, drag out fist fight. (Tonto's fight sequence is the more impressive one, since he ends up holding his own against an entire mob, until the sheer numbers inevitably overpower him. I won't spoil it how that situation resolves\u0085) Additional treats include the Lone Ranger donning the Old Geezer disguise he often used in the TV series, and Silver doing some memorable work (similar to Lassie or Flipper, yet amazingly, this does not come off as corny).\n\nCertainly there were no other actors, at least on screen, who ever did or ever could portray the Masked Man and Tonto as good as Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. Considering the material they had to work with, it would have been extremely easy for them to overdo it, or to be corny or campy. But no, they each had an almost magical ability to make these potentially ludicrous characters believable and likable.\n\nI am especially impressed by Silverheels, whose dialog for some inexplicable reason was always written as Johnny Weismueller-style broken English, always delivered his lines with credibility. Tonto was never ridiculous, rather the opposite. In this film, unfortunately, all the Native Americans have to speak in this idiotic way, and you can see how hard it is to be take these guys seriously. Yet Silverheels' Tonto always projects intelligence and valor, despite horrible lines. I attribute this to Silverheels' ability as an actor.\n\nIt's undeniable that the Lone Ranger's target audience was mostly kids, and that his appeal to adults draws its strength from the well of our childhood. Yet it is a mistake to classify this film as being strictly for kids; there are in fact, many adult themes. For instance, in one very effective sequence, a racially-motivated mob attempts to lynch Tonto. I don't think there is anything on the Disney channel today, with our supposedly uncensored media, that deals with the American tradition of lynching (which was never formally outlawed until the 1960's).\n\nThe plot itself is concerned with a very adult theme, something that is perhaps more timely now even than in 1956. The main action is concerned with the activities of a wealthy white man and his vicious second-in-command who engineer a series of 'false flag' attacks and incidents so as to cause a group of darker-skinned persons to be blamed. (No, this is not the story of the Bush Administration, except as allegory.) The false flag attacks are intended to promote a war between whites, who have greater wealth and weaponry, and the Indians, so that the small group of whites can seize control of the natives' valuable mineral resources.\n\nThis film has a view of Pioneer/Indian conflicts that, besides being historically accurate, is surprising to find in 1956. The Lone Ranger himself says outright that in all the fights between Whites and Indians, it's the Whites who have always started the trouble. There are anti-war as well as anti-racism messages that seem ahead of their time.\n\nThe Masked Man and Tonto, as unequivocal representatives of Good, channel their energies into a desperate campaign to prevent a destructive war. These two heroes have no super-powers or abilities, but appear to draw their strength from a respect for human life and a sense of fairness. They remind us of what we knew to be right when we were children, and inspire us to believe in those things again.",

All new and a brand new thrills , the story of desperado riders in the Old West and the silver bullet that stopped the most savage Indian uprising ever to menace America's vast frontiers . The legend of the Lone Ranger is \u00a8the untold story of the man behind the mask and the legend behind the man\u00a8 . This flick follows the adventures of the Ranger , his white stallion Silver and his American Indian pal Tonto, as they attempt to bring local criminals to justice once again. This cinematic adaptation deals with the Lone Ranger , here he comes , thundering up the West's deadliest silver mines trail , blasting his way and confronting baddies . The Ranger accompanied by the Indian Tonto who rides with him, on Silver and Scout, throughout the West, doing good deeds and they dedicate their life to combat the evil that Reece Kilgore -Lyle Bettger- represents. As they must prevent a war between Indians and nasty ranchers disguised as Indian riders in a dangerous adventure . The Kilgore's start a mining company on Indian territory, and the Indians aren't glad about it. The Lone Ranger must fight the savages and find away to make peace between Red Skins and White Men . The two heroes ride off in a cloud of dust under classic musical background composed by Rossini and shouting \u00a8Hi-Yo silver\u00a8.\n\n\u00a8The Legend Of The Lone Ranger\u00a8 is crusader's first silver screen outing . The film contains action , thrills , great scenery with spectacular outdoors magnificently photographed in Warnercolor . This shows a campy and entertaining glimpse at nostalgic television series . It packs some fine action , adequate musical score and emotion ; as children as well as adults will undoubtedly love this film . Clayton Moore is good as the mysterious and righteous gunslinger, yet he shows have an endearing innocent charm , while Jay Silverheels is acceptable as his faithful sidekick Tonto. Jay Silverheels played as Tonto in the long series and two films , he also played Geronimo in \u00a8Broken Arrow\u00a8(1950) . \u00a8The battle of Apache Pass\u00a8(1951) and \u00a8Walk to proud land\u00a8(56) . He performed about 30 Western from 1957 to 1973 in important roles such as \u00a8Brave warrior\u00a8, 'The pathfinder\u00a8, \u00a8Drums across the river\u00a8, \u00a8Indian Paint and \u00a8Santee\u00a8 . In addition , he played a cameo as Tonto in the parody \u00a8Alias Jesse James\u00a8 with Bob Hope . Furthermore , there appears Bonita Granville , she married producer Jack Wrather in 1947, who became the longtime producer of the \"Lone Ranger\" TV series and films. Following this movie, Granville retired from acting to become a producer on the long running \"Lassie\" TV series ; her final film appearance was a cameo in \u00a8The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1981)\u00a8, also produced by Wrather . Atmospheric as well as thrilling musical score by David Buttolph . In the scene where the Ranger meets the governor with his mask on, the music in the background is the soon to be \"Maverick\" theme , both this film and Maverick credit David Buttolph with the music. The motion picture was professionally directed by Stuart Heisler . His movies had a professionalism and a verve that many of those made by his fellow directors lacked . He also filmed detective thrillers , action and dramas . Stuart started his directorial career at Paramount in 1940 and turning out mostly \"B\"-grade films but was occasionally given an \"A\" picture. The majority of his output was routine but he did turn out several first-rate films, his best-known probably being the sleeper hit The Biscuit Eater (1940), garnering the best reviews of his career. He realized his first Western titled \u00a8Along Came Jones\u00a8 (1945). After leaving Paramount he free-lanced. He directed Bette Davis in The star (1952) and directed Ginger Rogers and Ronald Reagan in the hard-hitting anti-Klan drama Storm warning (1951). He made his last film, the underwhelming Hitler (1962).\n\n\u00a8The Lone Ranger\u00a8 was originally created as a radio play in 1933 by George W. Trendle and well developed by Fran Striker . The Lone Ranger started off as an America radio show started in the 1930s and finally ended in 1954 . It began in a \u00a8Lone Ranger\u00a8 serial (1938) , a program burdened by noisy action and starred by Lee Powell , being directed by William Witney and John English . It later expanded on to the big screen with 1938's \"The Lone Ranger,\" 1939's \"The Lone Ranger Rides Again\" , a Republic serial in 15 whirlwind chapters with Robert Livingstone , Chief Thundercloud and Duncan Renaldo . The Lone Ranger was also a television series from 1948 through 1957 in which gained widespread notoriety on ABC television, as Clayton Moore donned the mask each week to fight crime and corruption in the old west and of course Jay Silverheels as Tonto . The second film was co-starred by Douglas Kennedy , Charles Watts and Ralph Morris . Furthermore , new version by Willam A Fraker titled \u00a8The legend of the Lone Ranger\u00a8 that wavers between irony and seriousness , starred by Klinton Spilbury and Michael Horse ; but the film bombed so badly at the box office , as the movie's star Klinton Spilsbury never worked in Hollywood again. The last appearance of The Lone Ranger was in 2003 for a two-hour special on WB Network starring Chad Michael Murray and Nathaniel Arcand . Jerry Bruckheimer Films has debuted a logo for the upcoming adaptation of The Lone Ranger , this is the last big screen iteration of the famous character . The tagline on the site reads, \"The Legend Returns.\" Gore Verbinski has been contracted to filmmaking the classic TV show film , a blockbuster retelling for the big screen, and Johnny Depp is attached to play Tonto .",

                "text": "Near the end of his famous TV show of the 1950s, \"The Lone Ranger,\" Clayton Moore made this feature film with costar Jay Silverheels as \"Tonto.\" The main plot revolves around Lyle Bettger, who has plans of running the Indians off their land, so he can claim it and the silver mountain they revere. Lyle of course has his field hands who do his dirty work, which includes posing as Indians and causing trouble around in their name, so as to get the town folk on his side and against them. In turn, they will come to insist on the Indians leaving. Robert Wilke is memorable as the meanest guy under Bettger's pay, who looks like he enjoys every minute of it. What Bettger and Wilke don't plan on is the presence of \"The Lone Ranger,\" who has gotten a bandit/outlaw reputation with the town folk, even though he seems to only help those in peril and is always on the right side of the law. \n\nEnough of the plot, the star of the film is Clayton Moore as the bigger-than-life Lone Ranger. Throughout the film we find out how he became The Lone Ranger. Some may think this film, his and Silverheels' performances and his duds of a blue skin-tight suit and black mask are all kind of corny and/or campy. But all of it is the heart of the film, which makes us feel like we the viewer are The Lone Ranger. (He wears his disguise until injustice has come to an end and there is no further need for his alter-ego.) And, this film really delivers the goods. It contains the realistic dangers of the people's lives in jeopardy (who know too much and have to be dealt with,) while embracing the outrageousness of this mysterious ranger and his sidekick. It entertains without being too silly or too violent. Little boys today and of future generations would love it still. It is reported that Clayton Moore loved this chance to be The Lone Ranger, because, as a boy, he dreamed of being a cowboy or a policeman. With this role, he was able to be both. The Johnny Depp remake, which I have no desire to see, can't touch this nostalgic and captivating (with its iconic and timeless trademark scene thrown in at the end) bigger-than-life film.",

Compared to the Spartan production values on the ABC-TV series, \"The Lone Ranger\" movie looks like a million-dollar spectacle. Lensed in vibrant Warnercolor with a sturdy cast, featuring villainous Lyle Bettger and Robert Wilkie, Jr., this fast-moving, 80-minute horse opera never wears out its welcome. The Lone Ranger investigates trumped-up claims that the Indians have been straying off the reservation and committing havoc. The man arousing all the ill-will toward the Indians is the same dastard that hungers their land. As it turns out, the last surprise in this western is the revelation about the mineral rich ground on which the reservation lies. \"The Glass Key\" director Stuart Heisler maintains a sense of urgency throughout this tightly knit western and scenarist Herb Meadow provides a good line of dialogue occasionally. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels reprised their roles, and they have no trouble stirring up action. When you think about it, westerns during the post-war years constituted pictures about race-relations. Although the dastardly Reece Kilgore sets things in motion for a showdown, the outcome isn't what he expected. The Lone Ranger swaps blows with a potential Indian chieftain and gets clipped by a bullet to the head. Nevertheless, our hero re-emerges and resolved to capture the felons.

You can probably catch it there again since they repeat their showings throughout the year. So what do I know about the Lone Ranger? Well, I actually didn't know much about him until I watched this film, lol. My background with him is they would play the 1950's TV show after school in repeats in the 1970's at least for awhile they did, along with the Adventures of Superman, and Lassie, those were three shows I grew up with as a pre teen (maybe even younger) funny how that is what was on the TV for kids in liberal New York City in the 1970's, I doubt seriously that those three shows are on NYC TV today for kids. I would also watch the low budget animated Lone Ranger from the 1960's, although it was made cheaply I remember the stories as being exciting to watch. Anyway I was a big fan of the Lone Ranger and his message of justice and racial tolerance definitely had an impact on my life, but he had been out of my life for at least 30 years until last night when I watched this film on TCM. Why this film was not shown on TV is anyone's guess since they showed the TV show for so long, but whatever the reason, bottom line, if you are a Lone Ranger fan this is the movie to see. If you are looking for an introduction, of all the LR material I have watched this would be the best introduction I can think of. Really high quality and a typically good storyline as all of the Lone Ranger material is. This is great entertainment for kids but it's also interesting enough for adults. I like also that there is death and injustice and prejudice, these are all adult themes that most kids shows lack, that is what sets the Lone Ranger apart from other kids shows of the past and today. Why this has a rating under 7 is a sin, it deserves at least an average of 8. I suspect some vote it a 1 because of it's wholesome messages of good vs evil, rich injustice vs poor etc etc and just because people are hateful trolls and want to bad mouth good things from the past. With the new Johnny Depp film coming out, watch this one first as a primer to see how the character was known for 50 years and see if they distorted it or added to it's legacy with the reboot. 10 of 10.",

Here is a film from 1956, based on a TV series that I fully expected to look and sound as bad as they could come....was I surprised to find this had elements you might usually expect to find in a major work.\n\nTechnically, it doesn't get too much better than this curious show. If you can get your head around a masked vigilante leading a two man fight against all forms of corruption, then you could be on you way to an exciting ride, and ride they do! Some of the horse work is of the more spectacular type with several scenes where the horses actually run off with the honors.\n\nIt's all odd, and at odds with an America of the 50s where Afro Americans and Native Indians were treated as second (and third) class citizens ~ then along comes a hero of the highest degree, who with his trusted 'Red Indian' confident and 'friend', takes on the whole American political system! The production values were the biggest surprise for me. Firstly, an above average script credited to 'Have Gun Will Travel' creator: Herb Meadow (based on the original characters created by Francis Striker and George Trendle in 1932) this kicks things off to a good start, then you notice the great cinematography by special effects man Edwin B. Du Par. The action sequences are so well staged that you almost feel the pain being inflicted on the characters, who by the way, put up with unexpected levels of violence for this era and genre.\n\nStrong direction is given by Stuart Heisler who keeps the thrills flowing. The music score by Vienese David Buttolph blends in well with the strange choice of an Italian opera for the main and end titles! Those with a trained ear for 50s/60s TV themes will pick up the 'Sugarfoot' theme within the incidental music (I had wondered where that theme came from, now we know) The two main leads work very well together turning in sincere performances for their curious characters - I can't help but feel they had a genuine fondness for them, this all helps carry it thorough the shaky bits. \n\nThe bulk of the supporting cast supply strong performances and lift this near unbelievable story to a quite believable level. This was to be award nominated Bonita Granville's final major screen role, she married the films producer Jack Wrather and retired. I'm now looking forward to the follow up theatrical feature: 'The Lost City of Gold' Hope it's as well done. If you enjoy this type of 50s western movie you may have fun with this, give it a go....\n\nFootnote Up-Date: Have since caught up with the 'Lost City of Gold', somewhat of a let down.

                "text": "\nThis is perhaps Tex Avery's best cartoon, and it's because it has something one would not think of looking for in a cartoon, let alone one by Avery. That secret ingredient is logic. Yes, logic. This is a very logical cartoon, not because it presents realistic action (it certainly does not), but because the action - unreal as it is - follows a logical progression, and it's all the funnier for it. The cartoon has a very simple concept: a white kitten, harassed by a guffawing bulldog, hires the services of Bad Luck Blackie. With one blow of a whistle, Blackie crosses the bulldog's path and gives him bad luck - i.e., something drops from the sky and hits him on the head. The entire film is comprised of variations of this simple scenario, normal procedure for Avery. But rather than merely repeat the gag ad nauseam, Avery builds up the situation to a crescendo of outlandishness. With each scene, the objects become larger and more unlikely - from a simple flowerpot, to a piano, a lit bomb, a fire hydrant, and on and on until...let's just say that Avery doesn't stop at the proverbial kitchen sink. The dog tries to stop Blackie by any means necessary - good luck charms, setting traps - but always he succumbs to the inscrutable logic of the situation; whenever the whistle is blown, Blackie passes by and the dog gets conked. No matter who blows the whistle, no matter where the dog is, the result is always the same: whistle=black cat=conk! Finally, the dog gets the upper hand by applying some logic of his own. If a\nblack cat causes bad luck, painting the cat white negates the effect, and that is just what he does. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true, so the kitten paints himself black and saves his hero and gets revenge on his tormentor at the same time. Anyone else would have ended the cartoon right then and there, but Avery gives us one more twist, one that is ridiculous, yet still in keeping with the logic established early on. (Think Pavlov) If this film teaches us anything (besides being kind to kittens and beware of black cats) is the importance of logic in cartoons. Avery isn't merely laying one gag after another. He is developing the situation, letting it build naturally to a satisfying conclusion. He sets up rules for his characters to follow and bends them without breaking them. The result may be irrational, but it is never illogical, and it's funny as hell.",

There is a kind of ugly scene where the kitten is thrown way up in the air. The bulldog pulls a sofa cushion out and pretends to catch he cat, but pulls it away at the last minute. Frustrated and scared, the little guy meets a black alley cat who has the power to cross people's paths, giving them bad luck. Now sight gag after sight gag comes. Each is more clever the former. The bulldog never seems to learn a lesson. He is a sociopath, so his life is devoted to causing harm. I think the high point of this cartoon is the creative ways the bulldog is punished. Tex Avery throws in some of that eye popping, double taking stuff that he did, and makes this a real delight.",

The director is the famous Tex Avery and Rich Hogan (not as famous) wrote the story. Avery also works as voice actor. It runs for seven minutes as they usually do and I must say I enjoyed the watch for the most part. Especially during the middle, it was downright great and I was tempted to give 4 out of 5 stars. But the beginning and ending are not on par. You could say that this one is basically a collection of very short short films. A little cat gets bullied by a big bulldog, but a black cat comes to help and keeps bringing bad luck to the dog in the most unusual situations, locations and circumstances. But the bulldog is not dumb. Will it help if he paints the cat white? If he carries a horseshoe? Or if he just steals the whistle? Watch for yourself! This is certainly among the better Tex Avery films I have seen and I recommend it.",

                "text": "\nThis is among one of Errol Flynn's better films during his career decline, particularly after a long stretch of duds (his last best film was 1945's \"Objective, Burma!\" and possibly 1948's \"Adventures of Don Juan\") and before his short-lived comeback in the notable \"The Sun Also Rises,\" \"The Roots of Heaven\" and \"Too Much, Too Soon.\"  A high-seas tale that doesn't rank on the illustrious level of Flynn's other, earlier pirate flicks during his career height (\"Captain Blood\" and \"The Sea Hawk\"), but nevertheless what otherwise would have been a completely run-of-the-mill production is elevated by the main roles of leads Flynn and Maureen O'Hara and the oft-cast Flynn co-star Anthony Quinn as the villian (again).  They all bring their characteristic star quality to their roles, but rather than \"cancelling\" or overpowering each other as such strong screen presences are sometimes in \"danger\" of doing, they play off each other well.  Flynn plays Brian Hawke, a British naval officer on a top-secret mission to infiltrate pirate activity in Madagascar, under the guise of turning renegade.  He manages to convince the buccaneers that he's not a spy and is allowed to join them, but their captain, Roc Brasiliano (Quinn), remains unconvinced and suspicious. Their uneasy alliance is made all the more tenuous by the gorgeous and dashingly glamorous lone female pirate \"Spitfire\" Stevens (an apt name if ever there was one), whom both men desire; and by the pretty Patma, an Indian princess (who doesn't look Indian in the least, BTW)  whom Hawke has rescued and, along with being smitten by him and thus incurring the wrathful jealousy of Spitfire, ends up causing no end of nit-witted, unintentioned trouble and danger.\n\nWhile not displaying the breathtaking level of razzle-dazzle as in his younger days, Flynn still retains his trademark charisma and cheek, turning in a solid, albeit unremarkable, performance by imparting a mature worldliness appropriate to his character.  And while he's gotten bloated and jowly in the face, he remains handsome enough and has still has a fine-looking physique for his age, and, especially, for someone of his high-living lifestyle.  Still I have to admit I would have loved to have seen Flynn in this film several years earlier, at the peak of his godlike beauty, physical grace and magnetic powers.  As for Maureen O'Hara--no other actress could have portrayed a female pirate quite as convicingly as she. With fire and desire, dynamic spunk and sass and rakish allure, she epitomizes this she-rogue who is a match (and even more) for any man, but has rather forgotten how to be a woman--yet despite, or rather, because of this, is remarkably fresh, frank and sexy, no cunning feminine wiles here. Also, the sight of O'Hara's  impressive, strapping physique costumed in green pirate gear is a masterstroke--the color shows exceptionally well on her and is an amazing complement to her flaming red hair, green eyes and white skin.\n\nPoor Anthony Quinn is--in what must have been quite frustrating for him--again in the kind of unchallenging part he knows all too well, so therefore he doesn't go wrong and, more to his credit, doesn't allow any boredom he may have with his typecast role affect his menacing, spirited performance.  He is overshadowed, though, by the meatier roles of his 2 co-stars.  The big fly in the ointment is undoubtedly Alice Kelley as Princess Patma.  Looking not unlike a slighter-built, dumbed-down version of Jennifer Tilly (who's not all that intelligent-looking to begin with), she's emotes with such tiresome vacuousness and stupidity that it's near cringe-inducing proportions.  It's easy to understand, despite her character's fabulous wealth and pedigree, why she holds no fascination for Hawke and doesn't hold a candle to Spitfire.  To be fair, her character is not the sharpest knife in the drawer (more like the dullest one there), but Kelly lacks the skill and allure to make the role endearing.  And while the movie is filmed in lush Technicolor, a drawback is an obviously fake seaport set.  But the plusses outweigh the minuses, making it above-average fare, and at a succinct 83 minutes, it moves at a brisk, entertaining pace.",

Average-budgeted film by Universal Pictures , using appropriate ship shots and miniature sets when possible . Good acting by Errol Flynn as a deserter in order to penetrate a well-defended pirate stronghold on Madagascar . Though Errol Flynn did most of his own stunts, he balked at the one involving sliding down through a sail on a rapier blade, which was originated by Douglas Fairbanks in The Black Pirate , the stunt was performed by a double . Flynn suffered a broken ankle during filming, and while he was recovering, Universal took advantage of the unused sets by scripting and shooting a hastily assembled B picture, Yankee Buccaneer with Jeff Chandler. Flynn starred various swashbucklers and classic adventures such as \u00a8Captain Blood\u00a8, \u00a8The Sea Hawk\u00a8, \u00a8The Prince and the pauper\u00a8, \u00a8Adventures of Don Juan\u00a8 , \u00a8Adventures of Captain Fabian\u00a8 and \u00a8The Master of Ballantrae\u00a8. \u00a8Against all flags\u00a8 results to be one of Flynn's swashbuckling best though hasn't achieved the same classic status .

This is a good-natured Technicolor romp with splendid cinematography by Russell Metty and evocative musical score by Hans J. Salter . The motion picture was well directed by George Sherman , a craftsman and action specialist who had already filmed other adventures . Rating : 6'5 good pirate movie , wonderful stuff .

                "text": "\nAGAINST ALL FLAGS, Universal's 'take' on the WB swashbucklers of the previous decade, utilized the services of the quintessential Warner buccaneer, himself, Errol Flynn, in the lead. While he was no longer the devil-may-care young matinee idol he'd once been, the actor, finishing up his WB contract, negotiated a 'percentage of the gross' deal to make the film, and with a potential big payday as incentive, Flynn would show more energy and enthusiasm than in THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (which would be released a year later, and would be his last WB swashbuckler).\n\nAs Brian Hawke, a British naval officer 'undercover' to destroy the batteries of a pirate island stronghold, Flynn looks far older and more jaded than in his halcyon days (when his commander refers to him as 'young', you can almost see both actors wince), but his rakish smile is still present, and his dialog is ripe with the sexual innuendo audiences had come to expect from a Flynn film (to female pirate Maureen O'Hara, he says, with tongue in cheek, \"I'd looked forward to serving under you, ma'am\"...). Posing as disgraced and discharged, his obvious refinement draws the suspicion of ruthless pirate captain Anthony Quinn, but stirs the long-suppressed sexual yearnings in O'Hara, whose father had built the artillery emplacements. Discovering that the plans are located in O'Hara's bedchamber, Flynn goes to work on her, combining his mission with his infamous off-screen reputation for seduction, in a funny scene that both actors play to the hilt.\n\nPlaced under Quinn's command, Flynn participates in the capture of a galleon, then discovers that the 'cargo' is a virginal Indian princess (Alice Kelley), who'd never been close to a man before, other than her father. Having Errol Flynn as a 'first' provides another point of humor, as, after he gives her a platonic kiss, she nearly swoons, and begins incessantly begging, \"AGAIN!\" (A chant O'Hara would take up, as the film's final line).\n\nThere is the 'mandatory' discovery of Flynn's true identity, O'Hara's betrayal to rescue him, and O'Hara and Kelly both held as hostage aboard Quinn's ship, leading up, of course, to a 'by-the-numbers' final swordfight between Flynn and Quinn. Unfortunately, in filming the final duel, Flynn fell, breaking his leg, and the production was halted until the aging actor could heal (Universal, ever conscious of budget, filmed YANKEE BUCCANEER, with Jeff Chandler, on the Flynn sets, as he recuperated).\n\n\nThe shooting was, overall, a pleasant experience for Flynn, at a time when the WB had relegated him to 'B' pictures, and he advertised AGAINST ALL FLAGS in theatrical trailers as one of his favorite films. While it wasn't the hit he had hoped for, it did do well enough that the WB would 'green light' THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE, to be made in England. (Universal would remake AGAINST ALL FLAGS, 15 years later, as THE KING'S PIRATE, with Doug McClure in Flynn's role.)\n\nFinancial difficulties would soon force Errol Flynn to leave the United States, and the pirate yarn would be his last film shot in America for five years.\n\nA new stage of his rollercoaster career was about to begin...\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While it may not be in quite the same league as some of Errol Flynn's earlier work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for instance), it is still a greatly entertaining romp.\n",

                "text": "By 1945, and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces, Errol Flynn\u2019s hold over U.S. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler. The first of these was a good one actually \u2013 ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) \u2013 but it also proved to be his last big-budget Hollywood starring vehicle. The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954). However, Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways \u2013 albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers \u2018A\u2019 production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak\u2026 \n\nStill, the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady Maureen O\u2019Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles, so here he is typically seen as the baddie \u2013 the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) \u2013 a viewing of which preceded this one \u2013 AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant TV viewing when vintage Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels.\n\nFor all I know, this might well have been the very first pirate movie I\u2019ve ever seen and I cringe at the thought of today\u2019s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about! As I said earlier, AGAINST ALL FLAGS might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it\u2019s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same. Nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like Indian princess (Alice Kelley) towards her pirate captor Flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it \u2013 despite clearly not scaling the heights of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942), to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars \u2013 is briskly paced and reasonably engaging. Incidentally, the film would later go on to be remade as THE KING\u2019S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and, as a matter of fact, AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out \u201cPirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection\u201d set from Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER\u2019S GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O\u2019Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952; with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps but, so far, I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk\u2019s MUTINY (1952), the afore-mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).",

                "text": "Flamboyant leading lady Maureen O'Hara, having just completed her favorite film role, in \"The Quiet Man\", with John Wayne, now got her one chance to costar with another legendary film man of action, albeit during his declining years. I was unaware of this Technicolor Flynn-starring pirate yarn, filmed when he was looking and sounding rather middle-aged, being consumed by his rampant alcoholism. Nonetheless, he put forth a credible performance in this, unique for him, Universal-sponsored film. This is one of a rash of pirate-centered films that Universal sponsored in the early '50s: some straight adventure stories, others farcical spoofs. A number of these are currently available in a collective DVD offering. Of this group of films, this one certainly sports the greatest collection of high profile actors, if not being your personal favorite.\n\nMaureen was no stranger to being cast in pirate and other adventure-type films. In contrast to her previous roles in \"The Black Swan\" and \"The Spanish Main\" as an aristocratic lady desired, in this film, she is cast as one of the pirate captains, having inherited this position from her deceased father. This role enhances her opportunities to display her trademark fiery tomboyish personality. As in the case of feisty Alexis Smith, Flynn's leading lady in a number of previous films, her flaming red hair and green-grey eyes were made for Technicolor, sometimes denied her in her early career. This was one of a rash of films released in the early '50s that featured feisty women of a bygone era in roles traditionally reserved for men only. This includes: \"Anne Get Your Gun\", \"Calamity Jane\", \"Montana Belle\" and \"Comanche Territory\", the last again featuring Maureen. \n\nCharismatic Anthony Quinn was the third lead, as another pirate captain. He played a rather somewhat role in the previous \"The Black Swan\", with Maureen again the leading lady. As usual, he ends up the odd man out in a romantic triangle. Although physically he clearly belies his partial Mexican heritage, Quinn was cast as a wide variety of exotics during his career, often villainous, as exotics tended to be. Here, he curiously takes on the namesake of the otherwise forgotten historical Dutch-Brazilian Caribbean pirate Roc Brasiliano. Just why the screenwriters decided to so anoint his character is beyond me. The brutal Brasiliano never had anything to do with Madagascar nor Indian Ocean piracy, which are the centerpiece of this film. Furthermore, Quinn's character is apparently Italian, or perhaps French.\n\nInstead of the single damsel in distress Flynn previously fought and romanced with in his pirate films,here he has two beautiful women characterized as extreme opposites in the spectrum of female personalities, competing for his romantic attentions. Besides the sharp, gutsy, outspoken Maureen, he happens upon the demure, extremely sheltered,unbelievably stupid, Princess Patma, daughter of the Indian Grand Mogul. She happens to be a passenger on a ship that Brasiliano attacks, rescued from the burning ship by Flynn, Brasiliano's crew member. Man-starved throughout her life, this gorgeous creature(played by Alice Kelley) immediately takes a romantic fancy to Flynn, who responds standoffishly after he learns who she is. Presumably, he doesn't want to run afoul of the Grand Mogul, who no doubt has his own marriage plans for his daughter. What was the Princess doing on this ship? A favorite target of Indian Ocean pirates was shiploads of Indian Muslims, going to fulfill their lifetime quest to visit the holy city of Mecca. Probably, this was her case, as suggested by Flynn's character.\n\nWhen the Princess is put up for sale as a slave, Maureen outbids Flynn, assuming he wants her as a concubine, whereas Flynn actually wants to protect her. He hopes to ultimately get her aboard a British warship scheduled to arrive. Unfortunately, instead, she falls into the hands of Brasiliano, who uses her as a 'shield' to discourage the British warship from firing on his ship, as he tries to make a getaway, with Maureen aboard, to Italy. Brasiliano sent the Princess's chaperone to the warship to tell he has the Princess. Flynn saves the day by sneaking aboard the ship and dueling with Brasiliano to the death, abetted by rapier-wielding Maureen, after Brasiliano tried to rape her.\n\nMaureen keeps going back and forth in her allegiance between Flynn and Brasiliano, when they are at odds. Although attracted by Flynn's charm and seeming gentlemanly persona, she is scorned by his inexplicable refusal to make love to her at her beckoning, at one point, and is suspicious of his relationship with the Princess, among possible others. As she is leaving, having been frustrated, she suggests that another woman will probably soon show up. Flynn quips \"no, not another woman, 10 of them!\" \n\nFlynn plays an undercover agent, intent on infiltrating the Madagascar pirate rings, and disabling the numerous cannons protecting their main base at Diego-Suarez. He is successful at this, but seemingly outmaneuvered by Brasiliano's use of the Princess as a shield. \n\nMy favorite film role for Maureen, with great chemistry with Flynn. Quinn also great. Superb Technicolor cinematography. Unfortunately, Flynn is really trying to play his irresistible self 5-15 years earlier, with only modest success.",

It stars Errol Flynn, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn, Alice Kelley and Mildred Natwick. A Technicolor production out of Universal with cinematography by Russell Metty and music scored by Hans J. Salter.\n\nIn 1700 A.D. the Pirate Rebublic of Libertatia on the Island of Madagascar was in constant menace to the rich trade routes to India. Several days sail from this pirate fortress is the British merchant ship, Monsoon......\n\nPlot, in simple terms, sees Flynn as a British officer who goes under cover to smash the pirate ring operating on the coast of Madagascar. Swooning, jealousy, heroics, moustache twirling villainy and big hoorays do follow. It's a lesser Flynn swashbuckler that came at a time when he was fighting some personal issues as well as the onset of age. Filmed mostly on the Universal stages in California, with a small amount of location work shot at Palos Verdes, picture is far better than it probably had right to be.\n\nDuel with landing pikes!\n\nOK! This is hardly a rip snorter akin to Flynn's triumphs of the past, nor is it a particularly potent story, but it's a picture full of lovely optical delights whilst the lead performers have an ebullience that's utterly beguiling. Colour photography and costuming lead the way, both of which off set some of the cheapo corner cutting by producer Howard Christie. Direction is steady, with the actors comfortable with the jovial material to hand, and the finale doesn't lack in the crash, bang, wallop & hooray department. Flynn oozes laid back charisma, his unassuming kisses stealing the ladies hearts, Quinn enjoys being the dandy dastardo, O'Hara wields a good blade and broods a sexuality to knock the boys off their feet, and Mildred Natwick is as always worthy of observation, her visual acting most enjoyable.\n\nThe flaws are evident from the off, it's an easy film to kick and dismiss if in a particularly demanding mood. As pirate adventures go, or as Flynn swashers go, it's very much a minor work. But that doesn't mean it isn't colourful or fun, for it happens to be both. Universal's Region 1 Pirates of the Golden Age release of Against All Flags comes in full frame and is a rather good transfer to disc. 7/10",

Strangely, I'd never heard of AAF, though I knew most of Flynn's other films.  It was interesting to see Flynn's face change so dramatically over the years, and listen to his accent become more American.  I've never heard anyone mention this before, but I find that in his 40s, Errol Flynn looked a great deal like John Wayne.  In fact, I had to blink more than once during AAF to remind myself that this was *not* John Wayne!  \n\nI enjoyed this film, mainly thanks to the three leads, as others have said.  I had read a previous review about how sexist this movie is, so I was prepared for the worst, but I didn't find it *that* bad (comparatively speaking), except for the stupid ending.  The insistence of Maureen O'Hara's character that she will only kiss a man when she feels like it, instead of the other way around, her intelligence, confidence, honesty and her kindness to her \"rival\" all seem pretty feminist to me.  On the other hand, apparently it's quite all right to sell the Indian princess's nine companions into marriage, as long as the princess herself is saved!\n\nOverall, though, I found this film more racist than sexist.  The villain is once again the olive-skinned Hispanic (Anthony Quinn), and the \"Indian\" princess in her harem outfit (played by a white actress, naturally) is so stupid she shouldn't be allowed to cross a street by herself!\n\nI wasn't that thrilled by the sword-fighting, but that might be due to an overdose after watching three movies' worth!  I don't know whether it was the soundtrack, but Errol Flynn spoke so softly throughout this film that often I had trouble understanding what he said.  One little question: if you'd just stabbed someone, wouldn't the owner expect to see a little blood on his knife when you returned it to him?  The technicolor shows to good advantage, and I'd like to know where they filmed the outdoor scenes!  All in all, an enjoyable pirate movie for an evening's entertainment.",

O'Hara is totally believable as a tough woman of the seas, and yet in spite of her masculine demeanor is quite lovely when she dresses up, yet she is no fool when it comes to men. \n\nThis is almost a seafaring \"Taming of the Shrew\" with O'Hara telling Flynn at one point that no man kisses her unless she is ready to be kissed, yet she is even more offended when she offers her lips to him and he says he's got more important things to do. Her reaction is hysterical. Mildred Narwick, with Scottish accent, is also excellent.

                "text": "\"London Blackout Murders\" director George Sherman's formulaic seafaring voyage \"Against All Flags\" was actor Errol Flynn's final swashbuckler on the high seas against marauding pirates. Indeed, the title sums up the nature of piracy. Wicked pirates pit themselves against all flags when they hoist the skull and crossbones. Nothing really special stands out in the predictable screenplay penned by \"Essex and Elizabeth\" scenarist \u00c6neas MacKenzie and \"At Sword's Point\" scribe Joseph Hoffman. This is one of those daring 18th century escapades where the intrepid hero infiltrates the ranks of the pirates. Basically, two kinds of movies like \"Against All Flags\" exist. The first example is when the filmmakers explain ahead of time that their hero has committed no iniquity and plans to undermine an opponent with false information. In the second example, the true identity of the hero is not revealed until the final reel. \"Against All Flags\" exemplifies the first example. As the heroine, auburn-haired Maureen O'Hara enlivens this epic with another one of her ardent performances. Anthony Quinn projects a commanding presence and his use of gestures to reinforce his character is good. Compared to his earlier Warner Brothers' sea spectacles, this budget-minded Universal-International Pictures' release isn't half as spectacular. Lenser Russell Metty makes sure that all this nonsense benefits from his elegant Technicolor cinematography. The closest that \"Against All Flags\" comes to being unsavory are the repeated threats to relegate prisoners to the tide stakes. These tide stakes are planted in the shoal waters of the reef. Before the tide rises sufficiently high enough to drown the unfortunate fellow, the hungry crabs will have feasted on the prisoners. \n\n\"Against All Flags\" unfolds at sea with the following prologue: In 1700 A.D., the Pirate Republic of Libertatia on the island of Madagascar was a constant menace to the rich trade routes to India. Several days sail is the British merchant ship 'Monsoon.' The British Navy is determined to wipe out the heavily armed stronghold of pirates on the island. British Navy Lieutenant Brian Hawke (a mature Errol Flynn of \"Captain Blood\") and two sailors\u0097gunner's mate Harris (John Alderson of \"Violent Saturday\") and topman Jones (Phil Tully of \"All the King's Men\")--pose as deserters and take a longboat to the island. \"I don't like the cut of your sail,\" Captain Roc Brasiliano (Anthony Quinn of \"Larceny, Inc.\") opines when he lays eyes initially on Hawke. Brasiliano suspects that Hawke may be a spy, while hot-tempered beauty Prudence 'Spitfire' Stevens (Maureen O'Hara of \"Sinbad the Sailor\") finds herself sexually attracted to Hawke. Brasiliano wants proof that Hawke is a deserter. One of Brasiliano's gnarly-looking pirates inspects Hawke's back where our hero received twenty terrible lashes by a cat o' nine tails. The pirate had served on the East Indian Company ship Monsoon and he recognizes the distinctive handiwork of Flogger Flower (Dave Kashner of \"High Lonesome\") who delivered the punishment. Prudence cannot wait to get her hands on Hawke, so Brasiliano orders him to serve as his navigator on the ship Scorpion. \n\nThe secret defense of Madagascar is the point of Hawke's mission. He must spike the cannons defending the island so the Royal Navy can sail into port and blast away with broadsides at the moored pirate vessels. Hawke learns not long after he is accepted amongst the pirates that a map of the cannon emplacements hangs in the bedroom and he memorizes the positions while he is instructing Prudence about the make-up that women wear in proper society. Prudence's father was a well-known pirate and he created the gun emplacements. Meanwhile, when Hawke isn't romancing the fiery Prudence, he is following Captain Brasiliano's orders. Instead of allowing Hawke to horn in on his relationship with Prudence, Brasiliano makes Hawke his navigator. They attack a royal Indian ship and is carrying Princess Patma (Alice Kelley of \"Buckaroo Sheriff of Texas\") and her mistress, Molvina MacGregor (Mildred Natwick of \"Yolanda and the Thief\"). Brasiliano sets the Indian ship afire and MacGregor appeals to Hawke because the princess is still aboard the burning ship. Hawke rescues her and gives the princess a kiss that leaves the poor girl stunned beyond imagination. Afterward, every time that the princess lays eyes on Hawke, she begs for another kiss. \"Again,\" she pleads. This becomes a running joke throughout \"Against All Flags.\" \n\nUltimately, George Sherman qualifies as a competent enough director, but he lacks the artistic flair of director Michael Curtiz. Curtiz helmed all of Flynn's early swashbucklers, starting with \"Captain Blood,\" and Flynn assumed the significance of a larger-than-life hero. Little about \"Against All Flags\" is larger-than-life. Everything approves rather second-rate in this costumer. You know in some scenes that the gorgeous looking sailing ships are brightly lighted models in a massive studio tank. The close quarters combat scenes aboard the ships are staged with a modicum of verve. Of course, Hawke and Stevens will get out of it alive, but Brasiliano isn't as fortunate. Quinn excels as the villainous Brasiliano, and O'Hara is funny the more she gets riled up about the amorous Hawke. Happily, this 83-minute movie never wears out its welcome.",

In the film, she is a female pirate--one that is the boss of bosses and makes men cringe. She is \"the man\"...something that never could have happened in real life. History DOES record two pirate women (Mary Read and Anne Bonney) but they were NOT the captain and it appears that the crew on board the tiny boat they served even knew that they were women. There were no boss-lady pirates except in film...and all too often, they were played by Maureen O'Hara.

As for Flynn, while he was a serious hard-core drunk when he made the film, he doesn't show the puffiness and effects of alcohol like he did just a few years later. It's one of his last good roles.\n\nIn the role of the rival and hot-headed pirate is Anthony Quinn--playing a very typical role for him as well. However, despite his having made quite a few films in similar circumstances, he was quite well-suited to the role.\n\nAs far as the script goes, that is by far the worst part of the film--being mostly clich\u00e9s and predictable outcomes. But, on the plus side, the color cinematography is nice, the film is lite and easy on the brain and is basically harmless escapist fluff.\n\nBy the way, my favorite line in the film was a great double-entendre:\n\nErrol Flynn (to Maureen O'Hara): \"I shall regret not having the honor of serving...under you\". Umm....yeah.",

O'Hara was in the not dissimilar Black Swan but I much prefer her in this, as a feisty pirate captain called Spitfire. She wears Lincoln green a lot, perhaps as a nod to Flynn's Robin Hood many years earlier.\n\nSadly, I found Flynn to be the weakest link here. People say he's aged a lot in this, but no more than many of us do in over a decade, certainly no more than Bond stars Connery and Moore did in the same amount of time. I don't mind the 19th-hole, fetch-me-a-double-whiskey-and-Xerox-it pallour, rather that Flynn seems to be a man with the fight completely knocked out of him. There's none of the animus or spirit of his earlier performances - and Flynn without spirit is like Connery without his dangerous edge - or, as Connery appeared in Never Say Never Again. In fact, this vehicle has the feel of a belated comeback picture like NSNA or Indy and the Crystal Skulls, there's the sense that something is not quite right with the leading man. There's a defeated, shifty look in Flynn's eyes that's very uncharismatic.\n\nIt doesn't help that the script seems written for Flynn in his younger glory years, a lady killer who can turn Spitfire's head without preamble. It's a scene that anticipates Connery and Karin Dor in YOLT, but at least Connery had a bit more of the youthful, indolent way about him still then.\n\nI didn't care either for the plot, a Donnie Brasco-type thing where Flynn is a naval officer posing as a deserter to infiltrate the pirate colony, but that's just my taste. Like Lazenby in OHMSS going undercover as Sir Hilary Bray, it works against the leading man's natural brio and bravado. It would have helped to show some dastardly, nasty pirate behaviour early on to justify his undercover actions, because often Flynn plays the outraged insubordinate rather than an establishment figure. Still, the look of the film carried me through and I wish Captain Blood had been filmed in that sort of colour.",

There seems to be a privileged group, city dwellers, and a sort of untouchable group from the little villages. There is great hostility from the upper crust, even violence. There is, however, an equality movement being pushed which, understandably, isn't thought too highly of by the dominant class. Into the picture comes a young man who has become a teacher, but carries with him a secret: he functions within the upper class while actually being from a village. He has fallen in love with a young woman whose father was part of the samurai class, which is at the very top. So he has issues when rumors start circulating about him. Eventually, he must face a real case of cowardice and decide whether to do the right thing. This film is hard to watch because of all the gut wrenching and soul searching. The young teacher goes into convulsions of tears and tears at his hair. I know this may be part of the Japanese self of the time, but I tired of the constant whining and inaction. The strength of the film is that it has some fine cinematography. It captures an era about which I know little. It's propagandistic and so slow.

Spanish coral film with enjoyable screenplay by Leonado Martin and the same Berlanga dealing with a scientist whose inventions he thought to be good for humanity , but he then escapes from a hypocrite society that builds atomic dangers and nuclear weapons . Spanish/Italian co-production masterfully directed by veteran Berlanga who satirizes daily life of the post Spanish war and full of a high level of ingenious humor , including a light critical but without malevolent intention . The professor Hamilton (Edmund Gwenn) is a famous scientific , a wise naive old man that makes atomic artifacts , but tired his inventions to be used for military objectives , flees to realize his mistake . He escapes and shelter a Spanish little town called Calabuch , a idyllic place located on Mediterranean coast , a location where the whole world does what he likes . It is inhabited by diverse people : the priest (Felix Fernandez) , the smuggler (Franco Fabrizi) , the teacher (Valentina Cortese) , the Corporal (Juan Calvo) of Guardia Civil , the lighthouse man (Jose Isbert) , these are the most wonderful of the world . They have nature of naivety and help the scientific who befriends neighbours , all of them are very good people . Hid in these people he can live and die in peace ; Utopian Calabuch has an air of surrealism magic.\n\nThis is a fable/metaphor story that contains busy comedy , humor , frantic pace , blatant anti-militarism , joy , amusing gags , rowdy satire , noisy hustle ; but the main problem is that if you are foreigner you will have to know well the Spanish society to understand the double-senses and jokes . The main and support actors stand out under perfect direction of Berlanga very far from sour criticism that carried out in previous and subsequent works such as \u00a8Placido or El Verdugo\u00a8 that include bitter , pessimistic descriptions of social classes . In \u00a8Calabuch\u00a8 we can find very fun characters, all of them caricatures of the \"spanish way of life\" and a mirror on the Spanish society by that time . Awesome playing by Edmund Gwenn as a naive , ingenuous wise scientist . The movie displays a Spanish secondary star-studded such as : Juan Calvo , Manuel Alexandre (Berlanga's habitual) , the great Jose Isbert and the likable Jose Luis Ozores , Maria Vico , Mario Berriatua , Nicolas Perichot , as well as Italian players as Franco Fabrizi and Valentina Corteres who married Richard Basehart who starred \u00a8El Jueves Milagro\u00a8.\n\nDirection by Luis Garcia Berlanga is pretty good , he shows his skill for edition , realizing long shots with crowd who moves easily . Acceptable cinematography by Francisco Prosper , though is necessary a perfect remastering ; being filmed on location in Pe\u00f1iscola (Castellon) , where years later was filmed \u00a8El Cid\u00a8 by Anthony Mann . Lively and emotive musical score by Guido Guerrini and Angelo Francisco Lavagnino , though uncredited . Berlanga filmed several polemic movies during the 50s , all of them were beset by difficulties with the censors caused by real critical to social stratum such as \u00a8Bienvenido Mister Marshall\u00a8 (1953) , a very good film which tended not to be very well received by the censor for its acidity and considered to be one of the best Spanish films of the history ; however, his strong portrait of Spanish society , plenty of sharpness , didn't please the pro-Franco authorities . His next joint venture was \u00a8Los Jueves, Milagro\u00a8 (1957), it was modified by the censors and delayed for several years before its eventual release . Subsequently , Berlanga made \u00a8Placido\u00a8 (1961) masterfully played by Cassen , this is the film debut for the great producer Alfredo Matas and received an Oscar nomination in 1963 , being well-received at the International Festivals , reviewing the useless charity , it's a sublime film but with censorship realized by this great maestro Luis Garcia Berlanga . Later on , Berlanga made one of his best films: \u00a8El Verdugo\u00a8 (1963), one of the undisputed masterpieces and fundamental in filmography of Luis Garcia Berlanga where shows the miseries of an amoral society and shot at the height of his creativity, in a period cultural difficult, where the enormous censorship of the political regime, exacerbated the ingenuity and imagination of the scriptwriters . He continued filming other interesting pictures as in 1973 he went to Paris to begin filming \u00a8Grandeur nature\u00a8 with Michael Piccoli , another problematic film , focusing this time on the fetishism of a man who falls in love with a doll . Several years later , after Franco's death, he filmed a trilogy comprising \u00a8La Escopeta Nacional\u00a8 (1978), \u00a8Patrimonio Nacional\u00a8 (1981) and \u00a8Nacional III\u00a8 (1982), where he clarified the evident disorders in the Spanish upper , middle-class upon being confronted with a new political status quo , realizing a sour denounce of the Spanish society . Berlanga ulteriorly shot a peculiar film titled \u00a8La Vaquilla\u00a8 (1985) plenty of Spanish-star-cast and set in the Spanish Civil War , resulting to be the first time dealing with this convulsive period in comedy style . Following the same themes, he went on filming coral films such as \u00a8Moros and Cristianos\u00a8 and \u00a8Todos a Carcel\u00a8 (1993) that won three Goya Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Sound ; being his final film : \u00a8Paris Tombuctu\u00a8.

However, his new vagabond lifestyle soon lands him in jail - except that the custodian is forced to let the inmates go on occasion because their presence is required elsewhere: for instance, Franco Fabrizi is a convicted smuggler who not only plays in the local band but also happens to be the cinema projectionist! \n\nThis allows the director to poke fun at figures of authority (there is also the priest who won't concede defeat even at a simple game of chess) but, at the same time, celebrate Spanish customs - such as religious processions, the corrida (unusual here in that it takes place near the sea-shore) and a rival display of fireworks (where Professor Gwenn's mathematical prowess certainly comes in handy, thus leading the people of Calabuch to victory for the first time - but, then, a snapshot of the occasion exposes his true identity and the modern world on the outside comes beckoning to him once more!).\n\nThe latter results in a somewhat anti-climactic 'curtain' as the Professor goes back to his former duty without so much as a struggle, either from the old man himself or the community which had come to appreciate and love him. In retrospect, the entire film disappoints - in that I had expected the satire to be of a more scathing nature...but the pleasant detail of unassuming everyday life and Gwenn's central performance are, nonetheless, enough to sustain considerable interest throughout.",

A friend of him had moved to another country and sent a letter about his new life. Once arrived in the new country he had been put in jail, for some minor offense or so. Well, he had color TV in prison, also plenty of food for breakfast. It seemed a formidable life there: the worst that could happen to you was access to color TV and a huge breakfast in the morning.\n\nThis story came to my mind as I was watching Calabuch: a rocket scientist disappears from his research laboratory (where people don't seem to be very happy, not very unhappy either), and goes to a small fishing village where nobody knows him. He is immediately arrested for loitering, but the prison is as idyllic as everything and everybody there. To be frank, there is no color TV (the movie was made in 1956), but otherwise the prison is merely a very convenient bed-and-breakfast. During the day you are free to walk outside. The villagers take the man for an old tramp and everybody sympathizes with him instantly. Prison, people, traditions, church, chess games and phone service, even corrida, all is idyllic.\n\nMaybe the movie is like the story above: too idyllic to be true. Which means that the film director (like the guy who had sent the letter to his friend) intended actually to communicate that life was not that perfect after all.\n\nOr maybe we shouldn't suspect the film director of any hidden intentions, that's also possible: what if he wanted to make just a funny movie? A special note for Edmund Gwenn. It was his last role in a feature film and he was as irresistible as he had been throughout all his long artistic career. Gwenn was 79 by that time.",

                "text": "This is another Martin & Lewis movie I watched on YouTube. Like one of their previous films-The Stooge-there's some drama mixed in with the by-now familiar comedy associated with the team especially Jerry whenever he gets excited about something. But while I thought it was a mistake in The Stooge to have Lewis seem to still act naive most of the time, here he believably becomes a bit smarter as the narrative goes on. Also, since he does calm down here, he reverts to his natural voice whenever that happens which also contributes to a more natural mix of comedy and drama. It's also refreshing to see Dean be more of a supporter for Jer instead of occasionally treating him like dirt like in The Caddy. Likewise for when that does happen, it doesn't happen for long. He has two leading ladies this time: Zsa Zsa Gabor as the egotistical trapeze artist, and Joanne Dru as the circus owner who he calls \"Boss Lady\". Both are adequate enough in their roles. Then there's Gene Sheldon as the alcoholic star clown who Jerry seems to idolize despite his treatment by him. It's a good enough dramatic performance for him. Like I said, there are some expected outrageously hilarious comical scenes like when Jer has to tame some lions or when he convinces The Bearded Lady (Elsa Lanchester) to let him shave her. But this was also one of the more sentimental of M & L's movies as evidenced by the finale when Lewis in his clown makeup tries to cheer up a sad little girl in the audience. So on that note, I recommend 3 Ring Circus. P.S. Watch for occasional Lewis regular Kathleen Freeman as a victim of a custard.",

It's saddled with Jerry's sincere but misguided belief that he is a natural clown and screen heir to Emmett Kelly, who's makeup he closely resembles in some scenes, imitation being flattery I guess. The buddies, newly discharged from the army and penniless head for the circus where Jerry, longing to become a clown instead has to apply to be a trainee lion tamer (as if..) the usual water squirting elephants and disgruntled, drunken clown lead us to the quease-inducing finale when Jerry as the clown succeeds in making a sad little girl (in leg irons, yet)smile at his tears. For 1954 audiences I'm sure it was a pleasure break from post war blues but it's well past it's sell by date. TRIVIA: Unless I'm much mistaken the sequence where Dean Martin does acrobatics on some low bars is doubled by Nick Cravat who appears elsewhere in the film and was an acrobatic partner of Burt Lancaster.\n",

                "text": "As some of you may be aware, I\u2019m no longer that much of a fan of Jerry Lewis \u2013 though I did acquire the Paramount 10-disc set of his vehicles recently; growing up I watched a number of them (and also a lot of his teamings with Dean Martin) on Italian TV \u2013 and, not having checked out the latter in ages, I was wondering how they held up. Since I can easily lay my hands on the films released on DVD, I opted to give another look to one which, for some reason, has yet to appear on the format and which had certainly been among the first I became acquainted with all those years ago.\n\nI\u2019ve watched scores of films over the years set inside a circus (and should be getting to one more, THE BIG CIRCUS [1959], presently); many comic stars had tried their hand at this exciting and evocative milieu \u2013 so it was natural for Lewis (and Martin) to get in on the act as well. Jerry, of course, wants to be a clown but has to go through the ropes first \u2013 therefore, we see him as a lion-tamer(!) and, with Martin in tow, sweeping the tents, washing the elephants and as an ice-cream vendor, etc. \u2013 inadvertently, he even does a tightrope routine on a bike(!). Soon enough, his antics are getting more laughs than those of the company\u2019s star clown who, naturally, is jealous of all this attention \u2013 thus becoming mean in Jerry\u2019s regard, and is generally so soused that he becomes unfit for work! Another clich\u00e9d turn-of-events is the fact that the circus (owned by Joanne Dru) would be impoverished if it weren\u2019t for a star attraction in the form of trapeze artist Zsa Zsa Gabor; for this reason, she acts like a diva and, worse for Dru (who, surprise surprise, is attracted to Martin), holds him under her thumb! Helping Dru out is old-timer Wallace Ford \u2013 who purports to give the boys a hard time but, predictably, emerges to have a heart of gold underneath; also on hand are Sig Ruman as the veteran lion-tamer and Elsa Lanchester as The Bearded Lady! \n\nMartin (and Lewis) gets to sing a couple of resistible tunes, one of them to a bunch of caged animals!; the soundtrack, then, includes his hit from the previous year \u201cThat\u2019s Amore\u201d (first heard in THE CADDY [1953]) and the Paramount standard \u201cLover\u201d (from the superb Maurice Chevalier/Jeanette MacDonald musical LOVE ME TONIGHT [1932]). Anyway, at the bat of an eyelid, Lewis is awarded the spotlight of star clown (without having really demonstrated any outstanding comedic skills), while Martin \u2013 who introduces a spot of gambling to aid the circus \u2013 takes over the joint when Dru decides to call it a day. Eventually, Lewis and Martin also quarrel over the circus\u2019 customary show at an orphanage \u2013 which Dru returns to compere\u2026but, all\u2019s well that ends well, as Dino has a change of heart and turns up to sing for the finale (following Jerry\u2019s attempts to put a smile on a crippled girl\u2019s face).\n\nAs can be seen, the formula is typical Martin & Lewis: songs, girls, sentiment and Lewis\u2019 love-it-or-hate-it shtick; if anything, it\u2019s certainly colorful and mildly entertaining along the way \u2013 but hardly a classic of screen comedy and, while clearly a popular title in the Lewis canon because he gets to don the clown make-up (the film, in fact, was re-issued in a shortened version entitled JERRICO, THE WONDER CLOWN!), not one of the better outings from the team.",

Dean and Jerry get to do one new number, \"Puncinello\", and Dean sings the standard \"It's a Big, Wide Wonderful World\" to a bunch of animals!  (Hugh Shannon, the wonderful jazz singer-pianist who is most identified with this song, must have had a good laugh from Dean's version.)  Dean has no ballads and hardly any screen time with his leading lady, Joanne Dru.  It's all about Jerry, not silly, lovable Jerry, but a telethon Jerry, trying to become a clown. Actually, the film is quite amusing and heartwarming, but it's not Martin and Lewis.  I do not know if Twenty-first Century youngsters would find this amusing, but I did when I was a kid.

                "text": "3 Ring Circus was not a film Dean Martin cared to remember. Apparently this was a film that Jerry Lewis wanted to make because he got to play a circus clown. Dean had very little to do here, he only got one solo song though it's a good one.\n\nNick Tosches fine biography of Dean Martin says that Jerry ran the film, including picking the director Joseph Pevney. It was the first time that real tension was rather public between the team.\n\nDino and Jerry play a pair of newly discharged veterans who pick up jobs in a circus. Jerry is placed as a lion tamer's assistant and he has a marvelous scene with Sig Ruman as a rather inpatient lion tamer. Trying to teach Jerry the trade would be enough to drive anyone crazy. But Jerry is actually correct in his reasoning that if he just hires on with the circus, sooner or later his talents as a clown will shine through. Though he drives owners Wallace Ford and Joanne Dru wacky with his antics, he becomes a marvelous clown. That's a profession you are born to, either your funny or you're not. My favorite scene with him is Jerry trying to hand the aerial cyclist his unicycle and then getting caught on the high wire with it.\n\nOn the other hand Dino is caught between Joanne Dru and the star attraction of the show, trapeze artist Zsa Zsa Gabor. Gabor is also jealous when Lewis gets to be the real star of the show. I think you can figure out how all this ends.\n\nDean and Jerry do a song written for the film Hey Punchinello by Paramount contract songwriters Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. But Dean's one and only solo was the interpolated classic, It's A Big Wide Wonderful World. For reasons I don't understand he made no record of this so the only place you'll hear him is in 3 Ring Circus. The song was introduced by Buddy Clark in the Forties and it fits Dean's style perfectly.\n\nOther than that song, this film was strictly Jerry's show with Dean only in support. No wonder tension flared.",

                "text": "\nStromboli is a film with the look of Flaherty's `Man of Aran' and the dramatics of von Trier's `Breaking the Waves'. The story is the tragedy of a woman named Karin, a Lithuanian refugee after WWII and her pursuit of a better life marrying an Italian peasant and moving down with him to his birthplace, a volcanic island off the coast of southern Italy.\n\nRossellini portraits her heroin without sentimentalism or affection of any kind. He seems to be more interested in revealing her dark sides and miseries, but as Bergman's performance is so emotionally raw, we cannot but stick with her to the end of her journey. We do not pity her, but take pity with her. Rossellini's strong Catholicism usually forces us to live through his films as Catholics, regardless of which belief one may have.\n\nIf war was hell then the post war can be redemption time. Karin has nostalgia of her past, a lost-paradise, and all her efforts are put to restore that primal state. She's an Eva cast away from Eden, with somehow Bovarian ambitions, trying to reach prosperity at any cost. Her chances are scarce, so she takes the only opportunity she gets to leave the camp, marrying Antonio, a peasant whom she first kisses through barbed wire. She will soon realize that Antonio's island is miles away of the paradise of her dreams. The place is barren and the locals are hostile. She's trapped in a labyrinth surrounded by sea and menaced by an active volcano. Any form of relationship, even with her husband, is impeded because of a communication problem. Technically she cannot speak the language. But she cannot either penetrate a hermetic, oppressive world ruled by rites and tradition. If paradise was a state where men could speak the language of the gods in harmony with nature, Karin's pilgrimage will ultimately have to restore that dialogue, rebuild that bridge with origin.\n\nIn her symbolic descent to primitivism she learns the meaning of life in the hard way, and at the same time she follows all the phases of mankind from the first cry of the new born, to subsequent life in a cavern, cave-painting, elemental worshipping, fishing for subsistence and conversion. Karin's fault is her self-sufficiency, denying the existence of a superior order and her mundane ambition of a destiny ruled by luxury and comfort. She thinks the place is filthy and defines her belonging to `a different class'. When she realizes that there's no place for glamour in Stromboli she turns into an Eve and tempts the local priest. This behaving sooner or later will provoke the wrath of the gods, portrayed in the everlasting volcano to which the fate of the islanders is attached from immemorial days. To outcome her tragic fall, Karin should ascend the top of the mountain while getting rid of her material belongings (the money, the suitcase), rise up her head to the sky and address God. Rossellini doesn't show us if she saves her life or not because the thing is that she assumed her role of creature and thus her subordination to a supreme kind. Same as the villagers, who stoically accept the infuriated eruptions, or the fishermen that depend on the fruitful sea. \n\nThe most unforgettable sequence of the film is the one of the tuna fishing. Rossellini is so precise in the choosing of the images and the rhythm of the editing that the one feels that is seated in one of the boats bringing the prays. But the scene has much more than an aesthetic value. It works not only because it's beautiful; it is also informative for the story, dramatic in itself and in the events of the film, and symbolic both for the story and for Bergman's character, who watches the action from a neighboring boat.  Such an adjustment distinguishes art from a good movie.\n\n",

                "text": "\nStromboli Island is dominated by its continuously active (though  infrequently deadly) volcano. The Tyrhennian island has a desolate look. Its men fish the waters north of Sicily and west of Calabria, its black-kerchiefed women mind their business and watch everyone else's. There is little money, no electicity and no running water. The morality is traditional and narrow. In that world it is a given that the man is the boss. He keeps his own counsel. He chastises a wayward  wife as he would an unruly child. His woman's body is a utility for his release. The woman's pleasure is not a proper concern for the man. Or the woman.  Like the movie, life in Stromboli is black and white. In the best exposure ever of the fisher's life, we see the boats net a school of desperately thrashing tuna. Somehow Rossellini captures the scene from the fish's point of view. In another take, the hero puts a ferret after a rabbit and enjoyably watches his wife's distress with the killing. He scorns her discomfort with this reality. An elemental man, he accepts that what you is eat is what you kill.     Karin (Ingrid Bergman) was a flirtatious Lithuanian refugee with a well-developed sense of the world and herself. She wanted out of her post-WWII internment. Antonio (Mario Vitale) was a simple, horny soldier looking to acquire a wife. Eccola, Karin's ticket! They married and he took her to his island but it was apparent right away that Karin could not fit with the primitives of Stromboli. Antonio, though, expected her to come to terms with her situation, to \"come around. At the end a pregnant Karin is shown in an agony of conflict: the necessity to go from Stromboli and the necessity to stay. Unfortunately, we can't care for Karin inspite of her impossible situation: she is stuck on her own predicament to the exclusion of any concern for her husband. Antonio is a nice guy who does feel for his wife's misery. Although Antonio gives Karin a cuffing after one embarassment and tries to imprison her to keep her from leaving, his actions are restrained given his place and the time. And the provocations he's endured because of her eye for other men. She has made a fool of him. She has estranged him from his own people. We could care more for Karin if she cared a little more about the predicament she's caused poor Antonio. Note: Even a great director like Rossellini had to bow to Hollywood standards to get a showing in the U.S.: Antonio and Karin sleep in separate single beds a la Ozzie and Harriet (in Stromboli!) and Karin, toward the end of the movie, rests on the ground after coming through the smoky fulminations of the  volcano with not a hair out of place, makeup perfect, dress as clean and neat as if it had just come from the cleaners.

                "text": "Or L'AVVENTURA AVANT LA LETTRE, which actually encapsulates the situation of STROMBOLI. Although the recent death of Michelangelo Antonioni brought about many commentators who discussed the revolutionary effect of the first screenings of L'AVVENTURA (Martin Scorsese wrote such a piece which appeared in The New York Times of August 12, 2007), this was a far cry from the disastrous reception that STROMBOLI had in its original release. Of course, part of the problem was the extra-filmic situation, the \"scandale\" of the Bergman-Rossellini relationship.\n\nBut all that's in the past. STROMBOLI must be seen as the revolutionary work that it is. In the past (and this continues today), the film was castigated for its meandering plotlessness, for its seeming aimlessness. These are, in fact, aspects of the film, because the film is not \"about\" the passions of a woman (though this was how the movie was advertised on its initial release), but about lassitude. In effect, STROMBOLI was the first filmic expression of alienation, literally in the plot device of having Karin (played by Bergman) a displaced person, and metaphorically in scenes such as the one in which Karin is walking through the town and hears voices - she knows that they're talking about her, but she can't understand what they're saying. (The villagers speak in their Sicilian dialect, and Karin speaks in English; there is the scene where Karin redecorates the house, and the women come to stare, but when she invites them to come in, they just stare and skulk away.)\n\nThere are so many problems with seeing this film: it was cut and reedited and a voice-over narration was added for its initial American release; the Italian archival version is dubbed all into Italian. The actual version is a multi-lingual (English, Italian, Sicilian dialect) version which runs 107 minutes, with no narrator. In this version, the documentary aspects are fully integrated into the film.\n\nSTROMBOLI deserves to be seen in its full version, and deserves to be seen as the precursor of movies such as L'AVVENTURA, Resnais's Hiroshima MON AMOUR and Godard's UNE FEMME MARIEE.",

I've never liked Rossellini's films as much as Bresson's but I think the two directors often dealt with the same themes in similar ways, with minor stylistic variations. Where Rossellini used actors and non-actors who gave performances, Bresson used models and types who were instructed to remain impassive. Where Rossellini's films focused on passionate characters and emotional situations, Bresson approached his stories with a scientist's dispassion. I've always found Rossellini's films strange \u0096 they are often parables that invest heavily in domestic melodrama and the histrionics of their characters. Nevertheless, I think \"Stromboli\" is one of his most successful films. Karin suffers so much--a war refugee, internment camp resident and then harried wife and social pariah on a desolate island--that it is easy to see how she is blind to faith. Despite her eventual redemption Rossellini doesn't paint Karin as a saint. Her protestations regarding the social politics of the island develop into a crusade to transgress their customs and protocols, often in self-righteous objection to the constraints placed on her. And her willingness to exploit her sexuality further confirms her all too human (and flawed) nature. The scenes where Karin attempts to seduce the priest and later seduces the lighthouse keeper are brimming with carnal sensuality. Bergman, as always, is excellent.",

                "text": "\nAn enormous step forward from his three neorealist classics listed above. Unfortunately, I think it might still be suffering from its original backlash. It was pounded by the critics at the time, but that was all for reasons outside the film itself (well, not exactly; the film seems to mimic real life at the time, even if it wasn't meant to). Of course, I'm referring to the affair that Ingrid Bergman, the film's star, and Roberto Rossellini, its director, had during the shooting, which resulted in the birth of an illegitimate child. Not only were they not married to each other, but they were both married to others at the time. That wouldn't, of course, cause most people living in the United States to even blink today, but it was a huge scandal at the time, resulting in a box office dud for RKO Pictures, who had produced it. Fortunately, we can look at Stromboli objectively today and recognize it for the great masterpiece that it happens to be.\n\nBergman, in possibly her best role, plays a young Lithuanian woman who has lived a sort of decadent life. She is now in an internment camp in Italy, praying to flee to Argentina. Her only other option is to marry the Italian soldier, several years younger than herself, who is flirting with her all the time. The first option falls through, so she is forced to go with her backup plan. All's well, until she finds out where the guy lives and has every intention of going back to: Stromboli, a volcanic island where only the toughest farmers and fishermen live. Bergman is immediately distraught. She has grown up wealthy, had a lot of luxuries. Now she is living in a hut on a dusty, barren rock with a husband who can only barely understand English, which is, incidentally, only a second language for Bergman, as well. There is little communication between them, and, indeed, in this land, that is not exactly important. Still, the husband really cares for her. In all actuality, although we can jerk our knees at his conservative ways, Bergman is the one who refuses to compromise. From the first day, she demands to be taken away from Stromboli, to America or Australia, maybe. But there is no money to do so. There are a lot of customs on the island which she doesn't understand. She doesn't even attempt to understand them. Even when a friend tells her she shouldn't enter a certain person's home, she goes in anyway, completely embarrassing her husband. When she complains to the priest that she is utterly unhappy, he replies that he understands, but her husband is just as unhappy, maybe moreso. After all, the first thing she did when he went fishing was store away all the pictures of his deceased family and a statue of the Virgin Mary. Stromboli is an amazingly fair film in this way. In fact, my only complaint would center on the print I saw (on TCM, of course) rather than the actual film: it is unsubtitled, which means that we are meant to see everything from Bergman's point of view, at least in this version. I think that the Italian should be translated in subtitles, because there are a lot of long segments where the Italians are talking to each other that go untranslated. Rossellini wouldn't have had this dialogue if he didn't want us to know what they were saying. Of course, it's not usually very difficult to figure out what they are talking about.\n\nAmong other things, Stromboli contains two of the most amazing set pieces in the history of film. First, Bergman has someone row her out to see her husband while he and other Strombolians are tuna fishing. In an extremely lengthy sequence, we witness this event. This is far more reality than Visconti ever gave us in La Terra Trema a few years prior. Second, the volcano at the peak of the island erupts and the residents have to sail out to sea in their boats for a very long time. The film also has a masterful finale, although I think I personally would have directed Ingrid differently in the final scene. It still works wonders. 10/10.",

                "text": "\"La terra e dura qui.\" Ingrid Bergman is a powerhouse in this film (perhaps out of love and devotion to the director), but she still can't match the power of the menacing volcano on this remote island off the coast of Italy. Bergman plays a prisoner of war with a checkered past stuck in a women's camp, who marries a Strombolian in order to provide herself with the security she needs. Trouble awaits her, and the first sign we get of that is when she starts to complain of being cold on the boat that is taking her to her new life. What she finds is not up to her high Continental standards, and her attitudes towards the locals and the place itself diminish her already low stature as an outsider. It is less the people however, than the general character of the place that turns her off. The volcano, unnamed by the villagers, always awaits in the background, and setting itself becomes one of the main characters (thus the importance of the title), a force to be reckoned with, much like her character.\n\nAlthough this film is not noir in any way, and Rossellini himself would probably turn in his grave for hearing me say this, Bergman's character certainly does not hesitate in using her female \"wiles\" to get what she wants and needs. She survived a world war on what we take are wits and flexible morals, so she will also make it through this and I love her for it.\n\nShe even attempts to seduce the local priest by cooing \"I knew you were the only person who could help me.\" Having that attempt fail, she tries with the village lighthouse keeper seen at right, and I don't even have to explain the power of her touch. As she asks for help to escape from the village, she softly touches his foot with hers, and creates an unbelievably palpable feeling of erotic energy, something unheard of in mainstream movies today. I know, that's such a clich\u00e9, but it's true.\n\nAnyway, I won't discuss the ending, which angered me as a modern woman (even Bergman didn't seem to be buying it), but I will say that the film impressed me with its use of setting comprising plot, character, mise-en-scene, and theme. The film IS setting. It's also worth it just to see the non-actors performing a yearly tuna fishing ritual that dates back to the Phoenecians. Rossellini films are never just stories, they are historical documents. And I love him for that.\n\ncococravescinema.blogspot.com",

                "text": "I must confess that I don't belong to those who consider this movie a big masterpiece. The main problem is Ingrid Bergman and her role. Somehow I found it hard to believe that a woman who seems to be reasonably urbane and worldly-wise, or at least streetwise, and who seems to have weathered difficult situations during a World War in comparative comfort would follow an illiterate peasant to a dead end island. She has many scenes on her own in which she \u0096 I can't describe it differently \u0096 throws tantrums and feels sorry for herself. It just becomes a boring routine after a while and a little ridiculous as well. There is no character development whatsoever. I liked Bergman much more in movies like Notorious or Gaslight were she probably received better direction.\n\nHowever, the fantastic locations more than compensate for those flaws. The island of Stromboli is nothing more than an active volcano. The main characters live on the edge between the sea and the towering crater. All important movements in this movie are vertical. The messages from hell fall out of the sky in the form of burning rocks or lower themselves over the heads of people as poisonous gases. A contrary movement \u0096 up from the bottom - is the awesome fishing expedition \u0096 for me the most unforgettable event of the movie. Large teams of fishermen haul in a huge net, singing. Gradually the surface of the water over the net starts getting agitated until at last huge fish (tuna, I guess) start emerging in a wild frenzy and are hauled aboard. This is perfectly filmed an edited \u0096 and simply horrific.\n\nAll the elements come together and leave little action space for the cornered humans. The movie proposes two solutions: emigration or religion. The priest of the island plays a pivotal role in the story as he represents the link between the two options. However his actions seemed to me pretty inconclusive, at first he expresses himself overly optimistic, in an almost derisory way, as to the functionality of the ill fitted marriage of the heroine, then he declares himself incapable of helping the heroine, throwing her back onto herself in matters of religious belief. Eventually he comes through as the chief guardian of the dead buried on the island that is a kind of gateway to the world beyond. This is all interesting stuff, but it is not handled with particular care or discipline, which is a pity.",

The black & white picture is wonderful on DVD. In Brazil, this movie was previously unreleased on Video.

Zetes (\"A vastly underrated masterpiece\", zetes from Saint Paul, MN, 15 June 2002) and bkoganbing (\"Ingrid and the volcano\", bkoganbing from Buffalo, New York, 29 August 2012) both include good background about the controversies surrounding it. Cogs (\"Poor old Ingrid!!\", cogs from London, England, 2 February 2005) sees similarities between Rossellini and Bresson that I share. I agree with Cogs that Bresson is more interesting.\n\nStromboli is a showcase for Ingrid Bergman, who to my mind is easily the greatest actress in cinema. Karen's situation is Hellish. She marries to escape an Italian interment camp. She subsequently finds only misery with the desolate volcano-island that her fisherman-husband takes her to. The terrain is harsh and the locals are even worse. She discovers him to be overly simple and occasionally too beastly to bear. The finale reflects her desire for just a meager amount of happiness in such a world as this.\n\nVisually Roberto Rossellini is superb. His visual aesthetics are unsentimental but never boring. His camera work is unobtrusive.\n\nTwo of the most memorable scenes feature a disturbing quotient of animal cruelty. In the first scene, a live rabbit is needlessly sacrificed by being placed near a ferret. Rossellini couldn't use stuffed animals. He has the audience, some of whom are animal lovers, suffer by showing the kill in detail. Of course, Rossellini is strengthening the distance between Ingrid and her fisherman husband, and identifying her with the suffering rabbit. However, I won't give Rossellini any credit for moving the story along with this thoughtless tactic.\n\nThe second scene is the justifiably famous tuna slaughter with real fisherman, nets and spears. I have eaten tuna all my life and haven't thought much where it comes from. Also, I have no doubt that all of the tuna that we see being harvested was ultimately eaten. To give Rossellini credit, he filmed it well--with Ingrid nearby witnessing it as if she was one of the unfortunate fish. I just don't think that it takes great storytelling skill to rely on animal slaughter to move an audience.\n\nTwo other scenes that are noteworthy is when Karen attempts to seduce a priest, and when she (apparently) seduces a lighthouse keeper. The character that Rosselini and Bergman are portraying is flawed, and very human. She's no saint, she's a woman with unfulfilled needs.\n\nOverall, Stromboli is a must-see member of the Italian neo-realism canon. Very few films venture to depict life without false pretenses. Ingrid's Karen really suffers; and her actions make her a polarizing figure to viewers, isolating her further. Rossellini and Bergman are showing what life is really like as every member of the audience understands it.",

Her previous life, although loose, gave her finer things; now she lives on a rockbound island with neither electricity nor modern plumbing. Karin and Antonio are poor, so as the island priest explains, they cannot even afford to emigrate to America or to other places. As Antonio speaks English ineffectually, husband-and-wife communication is weak. Moreover, the women on the island do not like Karin; they feel she is immodest. Karin's only friends are the priest and the lighthouse keeper. She simply does not fit inside of this old world society; Karin is a fish out of water. Antonio does love Karin, but love is not enough.

But more, having offered us a broken soul, it unifies back into a single vision of the common source that encompasses every spiritual utterance.\n\nIt always comes back to the same; the same burning questions about meaning and plan in a cruel, perishable world, the same terror that we cannot effect any control upon it or make ourselves last. And, having experienced the anxieties of being and coming to pass and ineffability of attaining happiness, the path that leads out of them again. Every spiritual vision is a signpost on this path.\n\nRossellini's paradigm is simple enough; about a brazen, obstinate woman coming to live in an inscrutable, hopeless landscape, and about the life-renewing sacrifice that brings atonement. It could have been a simple story of religious lore, like Job. But notice how rich the different strands woven into it.\n\nThe woman filled with desires to please, planning for happiness. She wants to leave for Argentina or America, the paradise on earth where dreams are unequivocally fulfilled. She will use and abuse whatever she can to reach that imaginary place, which is only a childhood regression into the place where our every whim is to be pleased.\n\nAnd by contrast, a pitiless land; poignantly as a volcanic island, where life is constantly destroyed and created anew, and the humble, hardworking peoples who have made their peace with the toll of suffering. Now it's her turn to learn to let go pride and ego and abide by the common mandate.\n\nThe fishing scene is important in this aspect; as the ritual that brings men together into a single entity, working for the common goal that prolongs life. We assume her pov for this, as tuna fish are harpooned from the sea and violently tossed inside boats. She's aghast by so much pain, but now she knows how the easy money she has enjoyed all her life is earned.\n\nMore portents; the kids she encounters in her wanderings om sunbaked rock. The first kid allows her to realize the tears on her own face, the group of kids fishing clams lead her to the forbidden passion. The temptation to escape into a selfish world. \n\nIt is all about the inner journey to extinguish the flames of ego that singe the soul. Properly reflected as an outer journey that will take her through the peak of the volcano, the summit where god is revealed.\n\nOnce there we are offered the communion with god, as usual an internal monologue. The pride that had prevented her from seeking pity and solace now dissolved, she is free to return to the world with life-renewing wisdom and understanding. New life now grows inside of her, quite literally.\n\nRossellini shows how our effort to master the world brings only suffering. But if we allow ourselves to be one with and embody the mastered world?\n\nSubsequent filmmakers would make more sophisticated films on the same ideas (Malick, most recently), but this is the clear picture, an aesthetic so transparent and filled with a restraint and ardor that is only possible through a deepseated love for what cinema can do.",

She and Rosellini began an affair which resulted in her pregnancy which stars did not go public with back in those days. Especially if they were already married. It led to her Hollywood exile. But all that came after she agreed to leave Hollywood and star in Rosellini's new film Stromboli.\n\nThe financing of the film according to the Citadel Film series book the Films of Ingrid Bergman was from Howard Hughes. And RKO Studios released it here in the USA. According to Rosellini American censors butchered the film and he disowned the American product. It got mixed reviews over here, a lot of that due to Ingrid's indiscretions. It is fascinating how stars get bound to an image. No one who played saints and nuns on the screen could be involved in anything as sordid as an illicit affair resulting in a pregnancy. Our puritanical selves exiled here for years, she would not do another American production until her second Oscar film Anastasia.\n\nWatching Stromboli today I have to say that the story did not make Ingrid a sympathetic figure in the film. She's a displaced refugee after World War II and marries an Italian soldier discharged who takes her to his home on a Mediterranean volcanic island named Stromboli. The people there make their living as fishermen and Bergman who has some education feels totally out of place. She can't make any friends there save for a lighthouse keeper Mario Sponza. That friend her husband Mario Vitale doesn't like and he beats her when he suspects an affair.\n\nEven after Bergman discovers she's pregnant she still wants to leave Stromboli bad. In a scene that I can't believe got by the censors she's even trying to seduce the village priest who offers her pious platitudes and nothing more.\n\nLooming over all is the volcano and these people who know any minute that the volcano could destroy them all, just live and accept where they are. Someone who wants to get out as bad as Bergman does, simply doesn't compute in their lives.\n\nBest scenes of all with the realism that Rosellini made his stock and trade are the scenes fishing and the volcano activities.

There were in fact clear holes in the story, a product of bad editing.\n\nStill without a strong leading man, Bergman made Stromboli a most personal vehicle for herself.

                "text": "There's quite a bit of interesting history to 'Stromboli' that goes beyond the film itself. First of course was the scandal of star Ingrid Bergman shacking up with director Roberto Rossellini and having a child out of wedlock with him. Her reputation in the U.S. suffered until she made a comeback in 'Anastasia', winning the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1956. Then there was also the controversy over the international film rights to the English language version of the film which resulted in a court fight between Rossellini and RKO Pictures.\n\nThe Criterion Collection features two versions, one dubbed in Italian and the English version which also contains some Italian dialogue. Ingrid Bergman plays Karin, a Lithuanian woman, who finds herself in an Italian camp for displaced persons after World War II. She marries an Italian POW, Antonio, who she meets on the other side of the barbed wire, separating the men from the women in the camp.\n\nThe couple ends back up in Antonio's fishing village on Stromboli, a volcanic island, near Sicily. Karin, a high maintenance woman used to material pleasures, resents being on the island for several reasons. First off is the threat of death or injury from the volcano itself, which periodically spews boulders and volcanic ash on the hapless village below. Then there's the hostility of the villagers (particularly the remaining female residents) who chastise Karin for her lack of \"modesty.\" Karin also has trouble with her husband Antonio, who she regards as a simpleton and unpolished. In one telling scene, he pits a ferret against a defenseless pet rabbit, which upsets Karin greatly. Antonio, on the other hand, finds this quite amusing.\n\nKarin doesn't help things for herself when she refuses to listen to the counsel of the village priest, who urges patience, until Antonio can make enough money so they can leave the island. Even worse is when Karin attempts to seduce the priest, which alienates him greatly. Later, Karin flirts with a lighthouse keeper in front of the villagers, which damages her reputation further.\n\nRossellini used the village locals in most of the scenes. Some of them apparently had spent some time in the U.S. and came back to Stromboli in their later years. As a result, a few are able to speak some English. The scenes where the men are helping Karin and Antonio to fix up their home, felt believable, but I wondered if the scenes of outright hostility by the local populace (particularly the women), wasn't simply an example on Rossellini's part, of forced drama (after all, if the real-life villagers were so hostile to the idea of a narrative that features an interloper that they can't stomach, would they have actually agreed to participate in the film itself?).\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of the film is the on-location cinematography, particularly the excellent scene of the fishermen hauling in the tuna. Karin is juxtaposed with the big fish catch, as she is depicted as a person alienated from nature. Only when she gets into a direct confrontation with nature (after attempting to escape the island and threatened by the volcano) does she finally have an epiphany, accepts her situation and realizes that her arrogant stance, is untenable.\n\nThe role of Karin is an unusual one for Ingrid Bergman, as the protagonist here is not exactly very likable. In one respect, the part reflects Bergman's situation in her own life during that time. In marrying Rossellini and now living in his world, she had to fit into a completely different culture then where she came from.\n\nI'm on the fence as to whether there's enough there in Bergman's role of the dissatisfied and stuck-up interloper who eventually finds redemption, to keep one's interest. Yes we 'get' the idea that she's alienated but her complaints go on for a little too long. Nonetheless, 'Stromboli' has all that local 'color' featuring the real-life inhabitants of the island as well a few dramatic scenes which will definitely keep your attention (the volcano eruption, the big tuna catch, etc.). The Criterion Collection also has a number of extras worth watching, including an interview with a prominent Italian film critic.",

It is not for a modern mass audience, but if you like movies like The Bicycle Thief or Wild Strawberries, this movie is worth watching. I found Ingrid Bergman's performance superb as the well educated and literate wife of an Italian fisherman, rescued from a refugee camp. Once this refined young woman finds herself on a lonely island off the southern coast of Italy with nothing in common with the local people, she is at her wit's end. She will do anything to get away. The young woman tries to befriend people but every time she does, she seems to run afoul of the local customs. She pays a visit to a local seamstress who is shunned and this causes her to be guilty by association. When she decorates her home, her husband is upset by the removal of religious objects and old family photos. Even when going to church, she is stared at by everyone in the congregation. She finds some comfort in the priest who seems to understand her predicament and counsels her to save money for a time in the future when they can get away to a place that is more hospitable for them. This is not much consolation for her. At one point, the whole village is driven off the island by the eruption of a volcano that stands only a short distance away. The filming of this natural disaster is extremely effective and viewers feel they are in the midst of the eruption. For her, it is another reason to abandon the island forever. We feel that in some ways she has grown into a more mature person as a result of her trials; however, the gulf between her comfort zone and life on the island is too wide. The ending is neither hopeful nor despairing, and we can only imagine what might happen.",

This is a rather iconic example because of the publicity surrounding its release, together withe critical rejection. Usually you can see the way the film is bent because of the love. This case is different. Its the actress that bends to the filmmaker, who has some very bad artistic intuitions. \n\nOh, the philosophy of real narrative in a close-to-real container is well enough. Its a clean ideal, simple to describe. When it works you get the effect and you understand its effectiveness at the same time. Unfortunately, that effectiveness is rather blunt, of the kind a fishmonger would form. Since the method and the conveyed effect are linked you get films that when they work, are effective and comprehendable, but don't matter.\n\nThis one doesn't even work. Sure it has a real village and villagers, real volcano and real fishing activity. I suppose it also is genuine in its depiction of lives and the church. But it seems random. Like a dogma picture \u0097 a similar manifesto \u0097 the real to purity compromises what matters. There's only one false episode in this, meaning one episode where it deviates from the realist ideal. It happens to be for me the only part that touched me.\n\nIts when the wife has decided to leave at any cost, that moment when she sits down in front of what would have been a dressing table in a better world. She is flustered and unsure, but determined. She \u0097 Ingrid \u0097 demonstrates this. Its acting of the highest order. It fits nothing before or after in tone because for that brief moment she escapes reality to show us what is going on inside her. This would not be how it would appear in reality, but in that case we wouldn't see or know anything. Here she acts and we see truth. Its the only place where we do.\n\nThere are two other noteworthy things here that I caught.\n\nThe first is that the story has some tentative shape that wants to emerge. Something not followed but indicated: a lover who isn't there for anything but escape. We learn at the end, after we know that she is seriously beset, that she is pregnant. The revelation may have been simply that the actress really did become pregnant and in the service of realism it was inserted. But there's a tantalizing reverse invented narrative that we can glimpse about the handsome fisherman who she secretly meets. Is he the father? Its counter to the world of the story, which simply grinds along. But its an attractive feature. \n\nThe other interesting thing is how Rossellini has decided the world works. Its against us. Society is, the church is, nature is, individuals all are. We are trapped in a pinball machine of forces that simply don't care and its random what punishment you get for being alive. Its hard to see how Ingrid could have been attracted to such a man, and enlist to help him draw this for others. She does so not just in this film, but in a personal life she built with this man, stirring up unnecessarily hostile reporting on what otherwise would have been a simple romance. She becomes pregnant in two worlds.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

When it opened the reviews were as bleak and indifferent to it as Karen (Ingrid Bergman) is to the island of Stromboli. No one considered it up to Rossellini's \"Open City\" or \"Paisan\" in terms of genuine artifice. It was termed bleak and undistinguished with a plodding script that could only be called simplistic in terms of dialogue.\n\nFine B&W cinematography of a desolate island and scenes of an actual volcano eruption are not enough to make a 107-minute movie tailored to demonstrate the neo-realism of Ingrid Bergman's acting now that she had shed her Hollywood glamour. Bergman is ill served by a poorly developed character and embarrassingly inept scenes between her and her Italian fisherman husband (Mario Vitale). \n\nThere is startling realism in the tuna fishing sequence and harsh realism in the desolate landscape and close-ups of island people, but Rossellini did not seem to have a well developed or finished script in mind when he began shooting what others have called a \"masterpiece\". There is no doubt that had he the advantage of a well structured and conceived screenplay he might have been effective in telling this kind of story. But with the camera lingering on an anguished Ingrid Bergman sobbing in scene after scene of emotional isolation, the viewer is left with the feeling that this is little more than a post-war documentary in search of a coherent plot. \n\nThe unresolved ending used in the U.S. print is not the original ending, by the way, and leaves the viewer with the feeling he has witnessed an unfinished screenplay. It is said that Rossellini began shooting without a complete script on a day to day basis that must have been a strain on Bergman. It shows when he spends an inordinate amount of time on a fishing sequence that has little to do with furthering the slight plot. Too bad he didn't start the project with a finished script and a firm focus for his content.\n\nThe background music is oddly silent during some of the most emotional moments and despite Italian chants of fishermen the soundtrack remains mostly barren of any interesting content.",

Directed by husband Roberto Rossellini, this film has Ingrid Bergman getting married to an Italian, of whom at first she turned down, but at last relented, when authorities questioned her as to how she came into Italy. During the German occupation of Yugoslavia, her husband was killed in the war and she made her way there somehow, but now she must leave. So she's off to the Italian's home island of Stromboli, which is the locale of an active volcano. Immediately, she is restless and very unhappy, despite the fact her husband is very nice looking and some women would give anything to be on an island with him. But that they might say is neither here nor there. She tries finally to change her perspective and pretty up the place and make herself more pretty with makeup and have a more positive outlook on life, as she had felt stifled and depressed on this small, lifeless remote island. But the local married women look down on women who wear cake on their faces, and call her immodest to her face. She keeps asking what she's done that is really wrong. She put away the pictures of old people that her husband had up, because they were depressing and painted a design on the walls to spice up the place, but when she is seen talking and smiling with another man by the locals and talk ensues, her husband slaps her around and says enough is enough. The place goes back the way it was. The ultimate denouement of the film is, will she leave her husband to be free of the restrictive life she has there or will she find peace? I couldn't tell you, as the ending is ambiguous. She is last seen trying to leave by way of the volcano, but is overcome by the smoke. She prays to be saved. But what does she mean? What is implied? Some ambiguous endings work, but in this case, I didn't feel it did. Throughout the film, I was entertained by the film but aware of its flaws. I felt like it was a poor man's version of \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" as we are shown the life of her husband and his kin's way of life as fishermen. The fishing footage was very interesting to watch despite the fact Ingrid wasn't moved by being part of his life. She really made herself miserable. It's all in how you look at it. She may have wished for more and a better place in the world. But does she really belong to him and this world now? Should she reconcile herself to this? I am the type of person that loves films that show a lot of the ocean, so that plus Ingrid Bergman made this worth watching. But that ambiguous ending was a little disappointing to me. I would have preferred one ending or the other. Or, maybe she dies? But I don't think so. All in all, I think a Bergman and/or Rossellini fan would enjoy this film, flaws and all.

The ending, and I mean just the very end is silly and overwrought (preceding this is a lovely little poem of a scene to contemplation and wonder at the world when Bergman wakes up from her delirious crying dreams) and though he's meant to be a non professional actor literally pulled out of town the main guy who marries Bergman's character just isn't that good even as a first/only timer.\n\nBut Rossellini's aim here is to depict alienation in a stark form and he achieves it, with that volcano acting like another character - looming, always threatening, could and will blow at any moment and leaving those people below in a state of constant peril in barbaric terms - and the character slowly losing her mind in this predicament. Of course, it's easy to say she could have stayed in the temporary camp she was at in the start of the film (she didn't really love the guy to start with), but really this is just the kick off to what the filmmaker is best at showing and what his first time star/muse/lover is so strong at portraying: bewilderment and total disillusionment for a better life following the end of the second war.\n\nAnother actress could have hammed this up totally - only Anna Magnani, the original choice for the role, could have gone toe to toe - but Bergman is terrific at never having to say it but just being the smartest, least petty person on this island her new husband takes her too while he makes pittance fishing. She is tough and cynical and in another world could be right at home with Bogie.\n\nHere, when she breaks down in tears, which is more than once, it's hard not to feel for her especially as she tries to be civil and find a place for herself in this land of rubble. There's deeper existential ideas and notions going on here. But what I appreciated was how the heaviness of the subject matter was balanced with documentary sequences (or close enough to them). Just showing the locals all fishing and getting their giant tuna and other animals. You feel like you're seeing real work that is hard not to appreciate, and yet still crouched in this story of a woman lost with herself.\n\nThat may be why the ending doesn't entirely work for me- Rossellini means for her to find redemption, but from what? Him? I dunno. and yet there's always striking imagery, and a visual force even in the seemingly simplest of shots - and to go on a volcano, that's some pre-Werner Herzog s*** right there.",

No other movie has demonstrated this concept to me as much as Stromboli. (Tuna, in particular :^).\n\nIngrid Bergman had changed waters several times before. After a number of movies in Sweden, she went to the US for quite some career (think Casablanca or Notorious), and around the time of her work in Hitchcock's \"Under Capricorn\" she wrote a surprising application letter to Roberto Rosselini, asking if he could use her.\n\nHe could (in more ways than one), and Stromboli was their first movie together - a rare mixture of neo-realist quasi-documentary and highly emotional melodrama, with less than the little realism such pieces usually have.

However similarities, comparing films of 1950 and 2000 is less than comparing apples and oranges.

To begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. Then we are supposed to believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman she doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous Bergman in such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.\n\nSo she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. A place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.\n\nHer only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. On top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. She even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. Since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. To her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. I won't bother to tell you how this all ends. The no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (from seeing it on late night TV) that it had two different endings! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast Bergman. It led to her downfall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. I kid you not. It's pretty embarrassing.\n\n- - SoundTrack",

            "Living in an Italian refugee camp in 1948, the beautiful Karen meets Antonio, a resident of the men's camp. While not in love with him, Karen marries him and they soon set of for his home village, Stromboli. The village is on a remote island at the foot of an active volcano. She despairs at what she finds when she arrives. The village is on barren land and virtually devoid of people as many have left, mostly for the United States. She doesn't speak the local dialect and is treated with disdain by some of the locals who see her as an exotic foreigner and a loose woman. After Antonio beats her and locks her in their house, she sets off across the mountains to seek her freedom and a better future."

Douglas has thought out each turn of the wheel, each acceleration of the pedal, each pass to perfection... From there his ambition takes no limit and his perseverance to win by ways of antagonism from fellow drivers and estrangement from the woman who loves him...\n\nLively directed by Hathaway and beautifully photographed in Technicolor, \"The Racers\" is a revival of all five senses... The atmosphere of the circuits is electric... The energy and sheer excitement from the roar of the engines and the screams of the crowds are feelings that only the CinemaScope can produce... Whether or not your favorite hero takes the checkered flag, you stand up and cheer the winner across the finish line...\n\nBut like many another films dealing with sport, \"The Racers\" suffers from a banal story and questionable characterizations... It tries to increase its appeal to women audience by having its attractive heroine, a ballet dancer (Bella Darvi) one interested in high fashion... In this way female viewers glimpse the flashes of color of fashion salons in addition to scenic shots of the French Riviera, Paris, Rome, and the authentic locations of the acclaimed auto racing sites... \n\nNot only do you get the insight of a lifetime of champions (two of whom are played by Gilbert Roland and Cesar Romero) but you share many racing experiences with Lee J. Cobb who shows great aptitude as the racing manager... But again, it is the story - a routine melodrama totally unmemorable but impersonally efficient - that hangs heavy...\n\nFor those interested in sports car, speedways' drivers, and the celebrated runways of Europe, \"The Racers\" remains a film worth watching...",

                "text": "Yes, the plot and the dialogue are ludicrous. No, Bella Darvi (n\u00e9e Bayla Wegier) couldn't act, but the poor girl had had a very difficult life and a short and brutal movie career. Ironically, she died by her own hand, after several failed attempts, in, of all places, Monaco -- where, in the Racers, she meets our hero, Gino Borgesa (Douglas) when her poodle runs out in front of his sports car at Monaco, and he swerves to avoid the dog and crashes into the steps of the Casino. Great crowd control in those days. Yes, I said \"Sports Car,\" for this movie, though released in 1955, has much glorious color real racing footage culled from the previous 2 or 3 seasons, and, in 1952, for the first and last time post WWII, the Monaco GP was run for sports cars (won that year by Vittorio Marzotto, the lesser known of the famed Marzotto brothers, in a Ferrari 225S). \n\nForget the idiotic dialogue -- the dying \"Dell'Oro\" (Gilbert Roland), to Douglas: \"Gino, my crankcase is leaking!\" as he clutches at his crushed chest; Douglas explaining to the lovely- but-crosseyed Darvi how race drivers consider it bad luck to wish a race driver \"good luck\": \"'Into the lion's mouth!' we say, or \"I spit in your crankcase!'\" Forget all that and watch Fangio, Villoresi, Farina, Moss, Peter Collins, Robert Manzon and his doomed compatriot Pierre Levegh driving in real races: Spa, N\u00fcrburgring, the Mille Miglia. Check out how Maserati redecorated their cars to look like the mythical \"Aquila,\" or whatever the hell they were, under the stern team management of Lee J. Cobb, whose turn as Maglio makes Kirk Douglas sound like a native-born Milanese.\n\nIn a sly move (or simple accident of fate) director Hathaway created a quite believable pairing that resembled WAY more than a little Juan Fangio and his constant female companion whom the contemporary press always referred to, chastely, as his \"wife\" (Fangio never married, and it wasn't until 4 years after Fangio's death that author Karl Ludvigsen, in his 1999 biography \"Juan Manuel Fangio: Motor Racing's Grand Master\" revealed the real identity of his companion (AND his hitherto unknown son). The drivers of the time certainly knew she wasn't his wife, but that was a different, in many ways more honourable time; no driver, mechanic, or pit hanger-on would have even dreamed of going to the yellow press to spread the story for money. Those men were professionals: what Fangio did off the track was his own business. Off-soapbox. The stalwart Katy Jurado was perfectly cast as \"Maria Ch\u00e1vez,\" the wife of aging race driver \"Carlos Chavez,\" played by Cesar Romero -- better known as \"The Cisco Kid,\" and then for his defining role as The Joker in the Adam West/Burt Ward Camp-Fest \"Batman\" series of the '60s -- miles better than Nicholson, not nearly as dark as Heath Ledger.\n\nOriginal -- though not very -- musical score by Alex North, who had done such fantastic work scoring \"Spartacus\" and the Burton/Taylor \"Cleopatra.\"\n\nThe great American drivers John Fitch and Phil Hill did the stunt driving for this -- scraping the arch at Ravenna during the Mille Miglia at speed was pretty hairy stuff (done with a longish piece of wire and some fresh plaster). The overall Tecnical Adviser was the veteran racing warhorse, the Baron Emmanuel de Graffenried, AND this movie was also an early example of the title work of the incomparable Saul Bass, who made movie titling an art form in its own right with movies like \"The Man With Golden Arm,\" \"Exodus,\" \"West SideStory,\" Spartacus, and the ingenious and ground-breaking title-credit sequence at the beginning of John Frankenheimer's \"Grand Prix,\" still the greatest fictional racing movie ever made. McQueen's \"Le Mans\" COULD have been, but for McQueen's unbelievable and thoroughly unlikable ego and overweening insistence on his personal version of perfectionism, which, in the end, cost David Piper his leg and cost McQueen Solar Productions. When the budget went nuts and Solar Productions couldn't finance, or even FINISH the movie, let alone distribute it, CBS/Cinema Center stepped in, prolonged the sappy, wholly superfluous, and, of course, inevitable background \"love story\" (people ain't going' to the movies to see a bunch of goddam cars runnin' around a track, ya know!), and I believe CBS/Cinema Center were responsible for the movie-ruining 1970s-style \"Carmina Burana\"-meets-French-Jazz-a-la-Michel-LeGrand soundtrack. The CARS are the soundtrack, you meatheads! Off soapbox again.\n\nHans Ruesch, who wrote the novel and collaborated on the screenplay, had been a race driver himself, never achieving much, but even HE must have winced at \"I spit in your crankcase.\" Skip over the Douglas-Darvi scenes and go right to the footage -- magnificent!",

The woman made three films this one, Hell and High Water, and The Egyptian before Zanuck gave up. \n\nPoor Bella couldn't act worth anything, but supposedly her other talents were legendary. Her life story would make a fascinating film, much better than The Racers. Bella did look right at home in the various jet setting locales for The Racers. It's where she spent her time and tragically died too young there. \n\nAs for The Racers, Kirk simply reprises his role in Champion and goes through the motions. Champion was a far better film.

                "text": "\"Non c'\u00e9 pace tra gli ulivi\" (No peace under the olive tree) is a powerful neorealist film. It was filmed in natural locations in the mountains of Ciociaria (the homeland of Giuseppe De Santis).. The landscape and people mix harmoniously together in this film that tells a story as old as humanity itself. The rocky mountainous landscape adds an epic scope and an exquisite beauty to the film.\n\n\"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi\" tells a story of revenge and solidarity \u0096 A shepherd, Francesco (Ralf Vallone) after spending three years in the war (World War 2) and still more three years in jail, returns home. His old parents and sister had been left by themselves. A unscrupulous shepherd, Bonfiglio (Folco Lulli) had taken advantage of the state of chaos generated by the war to steal the flock of sheep that belonged to Francesco's family, leaving them destitute. And Bonfiglio doesn't stop at that \u0096 by way of threats and cajolery he forces Lucia, Francesco's fianc\u00e9e, (Lucia Bos\u00e8) to marry him. Bonfiglio is a man on the rise, slowly imposing his will on the other shepherds \u0096 stealing, threatening and using force when necessary.\n\nFrancesco on his return finds his family completely impoverished, barely having enough to eat and his fianc\u00e9e taken away by Bonfiglio (the same man that had stolen his family's flock of sheep!). But Francesco is not one of those men who put up with trouble without taking action. What will he do? \n\nAs you can see by my introduction, the story of the film is highly melodramatic, and the acting is also a bit exaggerated, but strangely enough this doesn't spoil the film, it rather stresses the strength of the story. The actors, the landscape and a story that seems to be taken from a Greek tragedy lend this film something almost cosmic and also very humanistic. Giuseppe De Santis's passion for his homeland and its people are shown in full force in \"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi\".\n\nCertainly \"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi\" may not be not as truthful to reality as other neorealist films. Professional actors star in the main roles. Raf Vallone as Francesco and Lucia Bose (that two years earlier had been elected Miss Italy) could stand up as models for Latin beauty. And even Folco Lulli as the villain doesn't lose his humanity. In fact, one could say that \"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi \" stems from the same sources that gave us Homer and Virgil. Following the classic patterns of the old masters, an old story of passion, greed and revenge is told.\n\nThe landscape, the dances of the shepherds, the songs, Lucia Bos\u00e8's beauty against the backdrop of the steep and rocky mountains of Ciociaria... enough said! \"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi\" as well as other neorealist films of the time (for example, the classic \"Riso Amaro\" also directed by De Santis) caused a deep impression all around the world. Lima Barreto, a great Brazilian filmmaker, showed in \"O Cangaceiro\", filmed in 1953, that he had learned a thing or two with the Italian neorealist films.",

                "text": "This movie, whose title translates as \"There is no peace amid the olive trees\" was for a time considered one of the important films of the neo-realist period, although quite secondary in relation to the masterpieces of Rossellini, De Sica, and Visconti. The movie was directed by Giuseppe De Santis after his international hit \"Bitter Rice,\" but it never saw the same kind of success.\n\nRaf Vallone plays Francesco Dominici, a shepherd and war veteran who returns home to find that his flock of sheep have been stolen by the area thuggish big-shot landlord Agostino Bonfiglio. Francesco decides to steal back what is rightfully his, and winds up in jail, through a series of manipulations and witness bribes by Agostino, who claims the sheep were always his. To make matters worse, when Francesco is in prison, Agostino manages to also steal Francesco's girl Lucia (Lucia Bos\u00e8.) When Agostino escapes from, he attempts to exact revenge on Agostino. The townspeople turn against Agostino There is an eventual final shoot-out in the manner of a good-guys/bad-guys American western, which, minus the horses, this film resembles. Hmmmm! Alan Ladd as Francesco, Jack Palance as Agostino? Cornered and unmasked as the true villain he is, Agostino does himself in by plunging into a ravine. Francesco is taken by the police again, but after they realize the probable injustice the guy had suffered, a new trial is promised for the sheep-theft and it seems that Francesco is likely to be exonerated, with the townspeople now willing to vouch for him, and he gets the girl too.\n\nThe tone and tenure of this film are very weighty, even ponderous, and the dialog is declamatory in style. De Santis wants to create the weight of a Greek tragedy, complete with the towns people acting as a continuous chorus. There is also a very unsubtle Marxist subtext (De Santis was a Communist), with Agostino symbolizing the bloodsucking owner /landlord class and poor Agostino and his like seen as victims of people like him. One of the lines reflects communist ideology of the \"only if we are all united can we succeed\" kind and gives a hint of the vast post-war turmoil of 1948 between the Italian right and left. Shepherds and their greedy landlords are to be taken as a microcosm of the Italian people confronted by the larger social and class issues of the times.\n\nThe photography by Piero Poratlupi is very stark and given to editing techniques and startling compositions typical of Soviet directors like Dovzhenko and Eisenstein. The music by Goffredo Petrassi further brings a heavy-handed veneer to the whole piece.\n\nWhile re-watching this movie I thought of Raf Vallone's very similar postwar-revenge role in Curzio Malaparte's \"Forbidden Christ.\" The plot also resembles that of Vittorio De Seta's 1961 film about a desperate Sardinian shepherd trying to avenge a wrong, \"Bandits of Orgosolo.\" While not a masterpiece, \"Non c'\u00e8 pace tra gli ulivi\" really does have a great deal of interest and melodramatic force and it ought to be better known.",

                "text": "\nI just saw this movie at the Museum of Modern Art in the context of a series of films on childhood, presented under the title \"Winner's Circle.\" Truffaut said that he was influenced by the film and it is easy to see the connection.  It is a sensitive portrait of a Parisian 14 year-old shipped off by his father to a horse farm in Provence to be trained as a jockey. There he undergoes various forms of ill-treatment from the other would-be jockeys and those charged with his training.  The movie also explores the themes of childhood friendship, misplaced adoration and sexual longing. Though filmed in a neo-realist manner, certain scenes of hazing seem to have been cut or intentionally omitted and the issue of homosexual child abuse is not treated squarely--but the film should definitely be seen nonetheless by those who enjoy the genre or the period. The title comes from the French expression \"faire ses premieres armes\" which means to experience combat for the first time or undergo a baptism of fire.\n",

                "text": "RUSTY SAVES A LIFE (Columbia, 1949), directed by Seymour Friedman, number seven in the series, marks the return of Thurston Hall and Stephen Dunne, each having appeared in THE SON OF RUSTY (1947). While Hall reprises his original role as Lawtonville's counselor, Franklin P. Gibson, along with Rudy Robles as Gori, his Filipino chauffeur, it's Stephen Dunne who assumes a different portrayal, once again as an unlikable individual, yet not so much as mysterious as before, this time sporting a mustache looking very much like Tom Neal (best known in DETOUR (1945) for PRC Studios), and showing no concern for what people think of him and wanting very much to live the life of a loner. One wonders whatever became of Stephen Dunne, whose name is just as obscure as this film series itself.\n\nThe story opens in Gibson's mansion with the gathering of his young friends, teenager Danny Mitchell (Ted Donaldson), his dog, Rusty (Flame), Tuck (David Ackles), Nip (Dwayne Hickman), Gerald (Ronnie Ralph) and Squeaky Foley (Robert Scott, filling in for Teddy Infuhr), who have their meetings in a clubhouse located in Gibson's yard. Following dinner, Gibson announces he's going to make up a new will in favor of the boys. That very night before going to bed, Gibson makes true to his promise, and after it's set, he places the will inside a book, concludes his evening with a cigar smoke (against doctor's orders) and goes to sleep. The following morning, the boys discover from Codo that Gibson died during the night of a weak heart. Gibson's sudden death hits the boys very hard. After the funeral, Fred (Stephen Dunne), Gibson's nephew, arrives from Chicago by automobile for the reading of the will. Almost immediately, he is disliked for many reasons: for accidentally hitting Rusty with his car (the start of many growls of Rusty towards Fred); his straightforward manner; forbidding the boys on the property where he animal traps are placed and intentions of building a brick wall around the estate. Unable to locate the revised will, Danny's father, Hugh (John Litel), a city attorney, reads the original will to Fred that requests for him to live on the Gibson estate and Lawtonville for an entire year as well as carrying on his tradition by entertaining the boys as their host every Sunday afternoon. As much as Fred would rather return to Chicago, he agrees to remain so to collect his fortune. During his stay, the boys, hoping to locate the revised will, come up with solutions such as writing nasty notes and doing damage to his property to get Fred to leave. When it's Danny's turn, who shows up during the night, he ends up having to save Rusty caught in one of the traps with a blaze of fire nearby. In spite of Fred's attitude, he does show kindness towards Lyddy Hazard (Gloria Henry), an young artist and secretary. After the two get into an argument, Fred drives off in a rage, losing control of his car that lands in the river, leaving Fred to call out for help. Recalling the title of the movie, it's anyone's guess what Rusty does at this point.\n\nA sort of story that would be commonly found in 1950s TV family shows, such as \"Timmie and Lassie\" for example, RUSTY SAVES A LIFE provides entertainment along with a moral lesson being \"two wrongs don't make a right,\" a philosophy that still relevant today. With the boys purposely causing mischief to avenge to an unlikable new neighbor is never the solution to anything, as told to Danny by his conservative-minded father in the manner of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal in the \"Leave It to Beaver\" TV series. Of the actors who portrayed Danny's father in the past, ranging from Conrad Nagel and Tom Powers, John Litel is a logical choice for the role (having played the father to Nancy Drew and Henry Aldrich in two separate film series) due to his natural and believable manner, along with Ann Doran as his faithful wife, Ethel. Historians of classic TV shows will not only discover Ellen Corby appearing as Miss Simmons, but Gloria Henry, best known as Alice Mitchell in the \"Dennis the Menace\" (1959-1962) comedy series starring Jay North.\n\nRarely seen on television in decades, RUSTY SAVES A LIFE, which runs at 67 minutes, finally turned up on Turner Classic Movies June 23, 2007. Next and last in the series: RUSTY'S BIRTHDAY (1949). (** dog bites)",

The Counselor has become very friendly with Danny Mitchell, Ted Donaldson, and his friends as well as Danny's dog Rusty after he wrote out his first will leaving everything to his nephew Fred Gibson, Stephen Dunne.\n\nThe movie \"Rusty Saves a Life\" has Danny and his friends find out the hard way that prejudging people is as bad as having people prejudge them. Resenting Fred in him getting his uncles, Old Man Gibson, house and business, a pottery plant, Danny and his friends, Nip & Tuck together with Gerald and Squeaky, attempt to run Fred out of town by making his life in Lawtownville miserable. \n\nFred himself is anything but friendly to Danny and his friends, and especially Danny's dog Rusty, but he's in fact only reacting to what their doing to him and his property. Old Man Gibson was about to leave his house to Danny & Co. but the fact that he died before he could write his intention into his new will made everything in his will moot.\n\nThe movie has the boys, Danny & Co. go so far as to even committing crimes, like breaking his house windows, in order to drive Fred out of town. The final straw is when Danny, together with his dog Rusty, tried to fill Fred's new swimming pool with dirt. Rusty getting his paw caught in a bear-trap that Fred left around his property has Danny almost burn the entire house down, with Fred's cigarette lighter, in order to save his injured dog Rusty. It's only when Fred now completely turned off with the people of Lawtownville, who sided with Danny & Co. no matter how much trouble they cause him, and about to leave town that he gets a sudden change of heart when he ends, with Fred's car driving off the road, up almost at the bottom of the river. \n\nUnlike in the other \"Rusty\" movies Danny is anything but the sweet and likable young boy that we got to know over the years. You can understand Danny's feeling toward Fred in him getting everything that Old Man Gibson wanted to leave to Danny and his friends. It's wasn't Fred's fault that his uncle died before he could finalize his second will but the way Danny and his friend treated Fred you would think that he somehow murdered his ailing uncle to get his money and property!\n\nThe bitterness directed against Fred by Danny and his friends even spilled over among the grown ups of Lawtonville who, no matter how much Fred wanted to be friends with them, treated the man like an outcast. Fred himself wasn't exactly \"Mr. Wonderful\" but at least he tried to get along with everybody in town which may have been why he became so embittered with them, the townspeople, in not really accepting him as one of their own.\n\nThe happy, but a bit convoluted, ending has Rusty come to Fred's rescue saving him from drowning. Rusty who almost lost his paw, in a bear-trap, because of Fred didn't hold that against him when he risked his life jumping into the river, injured paw and all, to save Fred from going under. \n\nIn the end Fred forgave everyone who made a mess out of his stay in Lawtownville allowing Danny and his friends to stay at Old Man Gibson's place, regardless of what his uncles first will said, whenever they wanted too. But it was Rusty in saving Fred's life who forgave him who, more then anyone else in the movie, showed so much disdain and outward resentment toward the friendly and lovable German Shepard that Rusty was about the only one in the movie that really had a good reason not to like him!",

He tells them that he plans to rewrite his will and leave his house, grounds, and pottery to the boys, and that the current heir is his nephew Fred Gibson. He also mentions that he had always hoped the two would get close but his nephew always ignored him. At the same time Frank Gibson mentions that because of his heart his doctor has banned him from all coffee and cigars, strictly enforced by his servant Kono. \n\nThat night after the boys have left is an eventful one. Kono breaks down and gives Frank half a cigar and two halves of a cup of coffee having been persuaded by Frank that he is not breaking the letter of the doctor's orders by giving him half of anything. Frank in this one case has been a tragically good arguer - he has managed to argue in favor of the instrument of his own death which comes peacefully in the night via a heart attack. Unfortunately he has not signed the will which he has rewritten that evening. He has also placed the handwritten will inside a book he had been reading, thus nobody even knows where the will is, if it exists in the first place.\n\nThe boys have lost a true and trusted friend in Frank Gibson. This is probably the first time these youngsters have had to face the death of someone dear to them. What makes it worse is Frank's nephew, who comes to town to collect his inheritance, is at first blush a big city cold fish and seems to lack every virtue that his uncle had. For the boys, this is what really deepens their sense of loss, not so much that they didn't get their promised inheritance, although at first this is what they rail against.\n\nThings aren't all sunshine for nephew Fred either, though, because his uncle's will states he must live on the property for a year in order to inherit it. Otherwise the property goes to a charity. So the boys set out to make life as unpleasant and unfriendly for Fred as possible, hoping to drive him away before his year is out. The funny thing is, they know they won't get the property if Fred leaves. It's not a matter of them winning, they just want Fred to lose. At some point Ted does put into words what I said earlier - that Fred is just a reminder of what they have lost - the true friendship of a great man in the death of Frank Gibson. What makes matters worse for Fred is that the whole town dislikes him, with the story of the unfinished will circulating so fast in the small town. So Fred's feeling is, if he has the name he might as well play the game. He no longer lets the boys cut across the estate to get to their clubhouse, plus he puts large dangerous animal traps all around his yard. Things just escalate from there. \n\nHow will all of this work out? Watch and find out. I will say that Columbia did a little too good of a job of casting nephew Fred. He truly has such an unlikeable air about him that it is hard to empathize with him at any point in the film, even if he had been helping little old ladies across the street for the entire 68 min. running time. \n\nThis is a good entry in the Rusty series about loss and denial and the unpleasant effects it has on people until they come to terms with their grief, and how there are two sides to everything. We even get to hear Fred's surprising side of his relationship with his uncle. I wonder who was right and wrong? Probably both men were a little bit of both since this series seldom paints things black and white. \n\nI'd recommend it if you are a fan of the Rusty series.",

                "text": "Rusty Saves a Life (1949) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nThe seventh and next to last in the series has the friendly counselor (Thurston Hall) who gave the local kids a clubhouse on his land dying and soon his nephew (Stephen Dunne) arrives in town as the will left everything to him. He soon gets into it with the kids who plan to take justice in their own hands and this gets both Danny (Ted Donaldson) and Rusty into trouble. RUSTY SAVES A LIFE is without question very routine and way too preachy but I thought it was a pleasant entry in the series as long as you don't take it overly serious. Once again the real benefit are the performances, all of which are pretty good. Donaldson, who was growing at a very rapid pace, is very good in the role of Danny and you can see how well his acting has grown in this part over just a couple years. Hall only appears in a few scenes but he's very touching and it was great seeing him again. John Litel and Ann Doran are back as Danny's father and mother and they too are in good form. The story itself really isn't anything overly special but the actors really bring the material to life and if you've enjoyed the series up to this point then I don't see any reason why you won't like this one. Sure, a better screenplay probably would have helped things but most series are DOA by the seventh picture.",

            "In small town Lawtonville, Illinois, teen-aged Danny Mitchell, his German Shepard Rusty, and Danny's five similarly aged friends have been close companions with aging and wealthy Counsellor Frank Gibson for three years, the seven having dinner together every Sunday. The Counsellor, who sees the five boys as the world in miniature and who espouses an all inclusive view of the world, tells them that he is planning on changing his will to bequeath his house, land and pottery works business to them - hopefully with them collectively and responsibly being able to figure out what to do with it all - instead of his current primary beneficiary, his adult nephew and only living relative, Chicagoan Fred Gibson, who he states doesn't much like him. Despite writing out his new will, the Counsellor passes away before formally discussing his new wishes with his lawyer, Danny's father, Hugh Mitchell, who has no idea of this new written document, and who only has Danny's word as to the Counsellor's true final intentions. However, the Counsellor throws them all for a loop when his executed last will and testament has an unexpected clause that affects both Fred and the boys. Not only because of the will but because of their general differences in nature, Fred and the boys - with all of Lawtonville on the boys' side in spirit - have an adversarial relationship, with each trying to out-maneuver the other. But Fred's dislike of the boys and Lawtonville does not even measure to his dislike of Rusty, and visa versa. The questions become if either side will get everything they want, if either side will come to a better understanding of the other, and what will happen if the Counsellor's unofficial hand written will is found."

                "text": "Getting an early release from jail (he was in for a couple months for his involvement in an accident), Kaalu (Guru Dutt) is in need of a job and a place to stay. He lands both at a mechanic's shop, owned by Lalaji (Jagdish Sethi). However, he's fallen in love with Lalaji's daughter, Nikki (Shyama), and it doesn't go over well with her father. Based on a reference he received from a jail-mate, he ends up instead working as a cabbie again, but his new \"employer\" is shady, and also employs another woman who has fallen in love with Kaalu. When Kaalu's new employer tries to involve him in a heist, Kaalu is faced with a number of dilemmas.\n\nThis is one of my first forays into classic Bollywood cinema. My previous exposure to Bollywood has been primarily through newer horror and thriller films, along with the occasional modern musical. I mention this because it will be difficult at this point for me to say much in the way of comparison/contrast with other relevant Bollywood films; I'm still on the upward slope of the learning curve.\n\nWhat I can say is that I enjoyed Aar Paar quite a bit. Like many Bollywood films, it spans a number of genres from musical and romance (of course) to crime, action and thriller. Dutt (who also directed and produced the film) and cinematographer V.K. Murthy seem to have been heavily influenced by Hollywood film noir here--their crisp black & white photography often features strong contrasts and heavy shadows, with pitch black darks and blindingly white highlights. But even though that style of cinematography is present throughout, the noirish crime/action/thriller plot points aren't very much the focus until the very end of the film.\n\nAar Paar is much more about romance, especially romance that is not reciprocated, or that causes familial problems. On this end, it is intriguing and frequently funny, with much of the relationship development occurring in beautiful, harmonically complex songs (sometimes the disco-like rhythmic repetitions of modern, Bhangra-influenced Indian pop and film music drive me crazy--it was nice to hear music in an Indian film without overly simplistic, unimaginative percussion).\n\nKaalu is an intriguing character. While he seems mostly a victim of circumstance, there are twinges of a shadier side that continually show through his adopted exteriors. A lot of the tensions in the film arise through two competing milieus trying to bring out one side or another of Kaalu's personality. Nikki and her family represent his sweet, innocent side, while his underworld \"boss\" and his lackeys represent a seedier, more hedonistic side. It's interesting that both sides have beautiful women attempting to lure Kaalu into their realm. In between the two we have Elaichi Sandow (Jagdeep), a \"street urchin\" who fulfills a function something like a guardian angel.\n\nThe least successful aspect of the film was the aspect that provoked me to watch it in the first place--the crime/action/thriller material. Dutt and scriptwriters Nabendu Ghosh and Abrar Alvi provide inadequate exposition and staging to convey the gist of the heist plot. Later, during an extended car chase and shoot out, there are editing (and possibly coverage) problems that make it frequently difficult to discern the action. This material isn't a complete failure, but it's not nearly as gripping or suspenseful as it should be. However, as this material is only a small segment of the film, and the other aspects of Aar Paar work extremely well, the slight problems did not bring down my rating very much.\n\nThe crime/action/thriller aspects may have been realized more effectively if they comprised a larger percentage of the film. Dutt almost gives the impression of having to tack them on, perhaps because of a studio that demanded something similar to the noirish American films had recently become popular worldwide.\n\nIn any event, Aar Paar is certainly a success overall. Dutt gets maximum mileage out of a couple relatively simple sets, interspersed with a few driving scenes (mostly process shots). The performances must carry the bulk of the film for its two-hour length; they do so easily. Aar Paar is well worth watching as an example of the work of one of Bollywood's important \"classic\" directors.",

                "text": "Aar Paar has all the style that Guru Dutt brought to every film he made. He plays with light and shadows like only he has done in Hindi cinema. But a weak storyline pulls the film down.\n\nThe plot just lingers over the characters most of the time and the story does not move forward. There is a hint of a bank robbery coming but all it does is to set the background for the climax. At the end, it is difficult to understand what the story was about.\n\nInspite of all this, Aar Paar is considered an important film in Guru Dutt's career. Not only because it is technically right most of the time, like any of his films, but more because in Kaalu he creates one of the most realistic tramp-with-a-golden-heart characters seen in Hindi films. That character is seen in hundreds of Hindi films but hardly any is as real as Kaalu.\n\nThe film has some great songs ever. 'Kabhi Aar Kabhi Paar', 'Ye Lo Main Haari Piya' and 'Baabuji Dheere Chalna' are timeless. Easily a Hindi film classic.",

This movie is the timeless story of a man trying to find acceptance and love. There are weak parts but they are overcome by the script and the excellent actors, especially Dutt regular Johny Walker. Shyama and Shakila both provided good performances and I would love to see them in a movie that was more focused on them. The DVD I had was very poor quality. It was one of the Forever Classics in the Yash Raj collection and the subtitling was way off. There appear to be at least 3 different versions on DVD, hopefully the others are better quality. All in all you cannot go wrong with Guru Dutt. If you haven't seen one of his movies before, you should definitely try Pyaasa first and then check this one out.\n",

During his time, Dutt, along with the likes of Raj Khosla and Dev Anand have specialized in this genre and have delivered some of the classiest thrillers in Indian cinema. Yet, 'Aar Paar' isn't without its flaws. Some sequences have been dragged on too much and the pacing, at some points, is very slow. Moreover, the Johnny Walker track could have easily been reduced. Most of the songs are a delight. The only one i didn't like was the 'Suhn Suhn' song which is also repeated in a sadder version. Guru Dutt plays his part of the streetsmart driver with ease. Hotties Shyama and Shakila seem to have done an odd switch of roles that had made them famous. Shyama who played a vamp in 'Bhai Bhai' does a fine job as a bubbly down to earth girl-next-door. Shakila who played a sweet charming girl-next-door is very convincing here as an alluring vamp. Overall, 'Aar Paar' is something that can easily be enjoyed with the whole family. It may not be among Dutt's best works but is nonetheless a fun watch.",
