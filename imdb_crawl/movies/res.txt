Milland plays a lifeboatman off the dangerous English Goodwins coast who is injured at sea just before he is supposed to be married, to his childhood sweetheart. A French femme fatale(played by the exotic Mona Goya)whom he has rescued, flirts with him. When his brother tries to break up the threatening romance, she comes on to the brother instead, and he plays along so that the Milland character will give her up, but the brother suddenly dies in an accident. Despondent,the lifeboatman disappears just as his mother has taken sick. After a big rescue scene in a storm, he returns in time to see his mother recover and realize that his first love is really the one for him. The production was shot at Elstree studios but released stateside by Paramount.",

                "text": "Before he became a movie star, Edward G Robinson was a New York stage actor who had difficulty getting roles, so he teamed up with newspaperman Jo Swerling to write a play as a stage vehicle for himself. 'The Kibitzer', starring Robinson, was a modest Broadway hit. When Paramount bought the film rights, they didn't consider Edward G Robinson sufficiently well-known to star in the movie version of his own play ... so they cast Harry Green in the lead role.\n\nFor modern audiences, Harry Green is an embarrassment. In exactly the same way that Stepin Fetchit and Wllie Best played stereotypical Negro roles, Harry Green played a stereotypical Jewish character: a pushy, money-grubbing busybody. Just occasionally, Green's on-screen characters were sympathetic, as in 'This Day and Age', but they always embodied the worst stereotypes of Jewish behaviour and speech patterns.\n\nSPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'The Kibitzer' stars Harry Green as Ike Lazarus, the owner of a Manhattan cigar store which is also the local hangout for people with nothing better to do. Ike considers himself an expert on the stock market, card playing, horse racing, the lot. He seldom risks any money on these things, because his expertise is all hot air. Ike's daughter Josie is romantically involved with Bert Livingston, son of wealthy stockbroker James Livingston. When Ike learns that his daughter and Bert are planning to elope, he decides to warn Livingston.\n\nIke strolls into Livingston's brokerage house without an appointment, and promptly walks into an armed robbery. Bert (who isn't actually Livingston's son, but no matter) has embezzled funds, and is now holding Livingston at gunpoint. More by dumb luck than anything else, Ike knocks the gun out of Bert's hand. As a reward for saving his life, Livingston offers to let Ike in on a hot new stock issue, American Steel ... sure to make a big profit.\n\nIke is too much of a blowhard to admit that he hasn't the money to go halves with Livingston. Instead, he sells pieces of his half of the deal to all the working stiffs in his neighbourhood, promising them big profits. Ike rapidly becomes the local hero ... until American Steel opens its trading, and the shares start dropping rapidly. The ending is unexpected but believable, and quite funny. All ends happily as Josie marries that nice goyisher Eddie Brown.\n\nThere are some good laughs in 'The Kibitzer', but many of them are compromised by the extremely annoying personality of Harry Green. Edward G Robinson eventually proved his ability with comedy, and it would have been nice to see him in the role that he tailored for himself. I'll rate 'The Kibitzer' 7 out of 10.",

                "text": "If you'd like to know what made the Disney studio's output so special, and stand out so strongly from the rest of the pack, take a look at some of the early Mickey Mouse cartoons from around 1929-30. The Jazz Fool was produced just as Mickey was catching on as a highly popular character, and like so many of the early efforts it's a plot-free, high-spirited romp consisting of non-stop music and dancing. This particular cartoon isn't one of the select few usually ranked among the \"classics\" by connoisseurs; it is, in essence, just another release in the ongoing Mickey series, but it's a charmer from start to finish which demonstrates just how good the Disney studio's routine product from this period could be.\n\nThe show kicks off with a parade: Mickey rolls along on a horse-drawn wagon, playing a goofy tune on a calliope while dozens of animals dance along behind. He's parading through a rural area, inspiring local cows to stop grazing and waltz to the music. Even pairs of flannel long johns drop off a clothes-line to join in. When the wagon halts Mickey plays for the gathering crowd, while his horse\u0097who looks like an early version of Horace Horsecollar\u0097provides percussion alternately on a drum, on a local cat who happens to be handy, and then on his own dentures. Once the crowd has gathered in the auditorium Mickey takes the stage looking dapper and self-confident: he wears a top hat, spins a cane, and carries a satchel. First he opens the satchel and it becomes a baby grand piano, then he smoothly turns his hat and cane into a stool. (Mickey possesses Felix the Cat-like magical powers in this cartoon.) Seated, he launches into a jaunty melody, and performs some cute musical gags: for instance, when he slams the keyboard several keys fly into the air, and land just in time to complete a melodic phrase.\n\nAs the performance continues, however, something interesting happens. Mickey's playing becomes more and more aggressive. He beats time on the side of the piano, then pounds the lid, then starts hammering the keys with his fists, and we gradually become aware that the piano itself is reacting angrily to this treatment. It grimaces, bears its \"teeth\" at its tormentor, and puts up resistance as the treatment gets rougher. Mickey responds by playing more intensely and actually spitting tobacco juice onto the keys. Finally, striking a masterful lion tamer stance, he beats his adversary into submission for an exhilarating finale. The piano crumples, exhausted\u0097then, in a surprise finish, it comes back to life and bites the seat of Mickey's pants! This is a terrific cartoon, better seen than described. Hardly any words are spoken and none are needed: the progress of Mickey's battle with the baby grand is easily followed, told entirely through witty character animation, music, and sound effects. The Jazz Fool is simplicity itself, yet it somehow strikes a deeper chord, like the most memorable scenes in the best silent comedies.\n\nP.S. The title of this short is a play on two of Al Jolson's then-recent successes for Warner Brothers, The Jazz Singer and The Singing Fool, but there are no Jolson impressions or specific references to either feature. This cartoon stands on its own, with no topical references to date it.",

It was Mickey's facial expressions that were the most impressive thing in this regard, the anger, frustration and happiness are done so simply with raised eyebrows, turns of the mouth and the direction of his nose and shoulders but at the same time with so much expression. The music is lovely, with some lively tunes and Gershwin-like riffs interestingly arranged. It is at its catchiest when Mickey and Horace arrive at their destination at first. There are some fun bits like Horace playing even his teeth and shoes in perfect synch to the music, Mickey spanking the bum of the piano and the piano even retaliates by biting Mickey on the bottom. Mickey is very likable, as is Horace. Sadly, the story is very thin, two-thirds of it is literally Mickey just playing the piano and giving it a hard time. The gags are not very imaginative either, and not all of them hit the mark. Mickey's piano solo is almost exactly like a repeat of The Opry House.

Horace Horsecollar gets to showoff his solo instrumentalist talents. The animators threw in a heavy dose of their favorite posterior jokes - even Mickey's piano has its bare bottom smacked. The title is a\nsalute to two recent Al Jolson film hits, THE JAZZ SINGER (1927) & THE SINGING FOOL (1928). Walt Disney performs Mickey's squeaky voice.\n\nWalt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by drawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a\nblizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.",

                "text": "THE LOST ZEPPELIN (1929) a Tiffany Studio release (who ever they were) features a typical service triangle with the romance of early aviation. Zeppelins (ie Dirigibles) were hot stuff at this time popularized by their successes during World War I (WWI) and commercial traffic developed by Germany postwar.\n\nThe best part of the film is the second half that concentrates on the Antartic flight of the titled character, it's wreck and the rescue of the survivors. There is some references to the disaster of the Scott expedition (1912) where the entire polar party died on the way back from the pole. For those unfamiliar with the story read the Roland Huntford book 'The Last Place on Earth' for the triumph of Amundsen and the defeat of Scott.\n\nThe film is technically adapt for the time but you can see the problem the actors where having with the early sound equipment. The actors freeze and will not move even their heads in case they miss their marks and the microphones. In many scenes voice overs were used to cover multiple actors. To show how fast things improved in just two (2) years watch DIRIGIBLE (1931) Columbia Pictures, Frank Capra directing. Pretty much the same stuff, romance triangle and Antartic expedition though this time with AeroPlanes (Ford TriMotor) and two (2) Zeppelins. Balloons, Blimps and other period aircraft were also featured. The picture benefits from two (2) years of technical advancements and we would rate it six (6) stars ******.",

                "text": "Dated adventure film about an attempt to be the first to fly a zeppelin over the South Pole.\n\nThe film is essentially two movies. The first is a long drawn out sequence at the start showing how the wife of the head of the expedition is in love with the second in command. This runs for about 25 minutes as they dress go to a send off party and then have guilt over the whole thing. Despite some good dialog this part of the movie is deadly dull. The rest of the film concerns the expedition and is much more interesting. Here we follow the flight as we see the airship fly to toward the Pole and eventually run into trouble (this isn't giving anything away because one need only look at the title to see what happens). This part of the film has some fantastic effects work with the shots of the zeppelin in flight and the Antarctic landscape with all its dangers over powering any feelings that this film is anything less than spectacular. What we see on screen is truly amazing since it was done with out computers and comes across looking oh so more real for it. The films flaws are for the most part limited to the fact that this film was made in the early days of sound and so we either have very talky sequences or ones that are very quiet.\n\nIf you want to see some stunning effects in a good adventure you might want to try this, though you'll want to fast forward through the first 25 minutes since they really can be dull. (This would make a good double feature with the Red Tent the true story of similar attempt to fly an airship over the North Pole a few years before this was made, and which was probably the inspiration for this film)",

                "text": "Virginia Valli had been a stenographer who broke into films in 1915. Her beauty found her fame and she made many films during the twenties. With talkies though, her voice was too high pitched for the primitive microphone technology - she only made a few before retiring for marriage with Charles Farrell. In \"The Lost Zeppelin\" she does play a very whiney woman, Miriam, who while married to Commander Donald Hall (Conway Tearle) is desperately in love with Tom Armstrong (Ricardo Cortez). The scene on the couch where she is imploring Armstrong to tell her the truth about her husband's bravery would have most people running from the room holding their ears!!\n\nBoth Tearle and Cortez play their parts with a stiff upper lip: if you have ever seen Tearle in movies you know it is his usual acting style but Cortez I think was still finding his talkie feet and within a year would be his usual relaxed charming self in films like \"Behind Office Doors\" and \"The Maltese Falcon\".\n\nEven though Hall is devastated by seeing his wife in the arms of another man the show must go on - the show being an expedition to the South Pole and, you guessed it, Hall and Armstrong are going together!! Even though Tiffany (\"the better entertainment\") was the top of the tree as far as independent studios went, it is an amazingly ambitious epic. The first 20 minutes did drag but it may have been to lure patrons in for some talk, for once in the air it really took off! The South Pole was very topical at the time as Admiral Byrd was making his first expeditions. The visual effects are terrific, the zeppelin in the air looked pretty realistic as it puttered through the clouds and above the polar naval base. Kenneth Peach Sr. A.S.C. was the cameraman and Jack Robson was a specialist in mechanical effects.\n\nA storm disables the zeppelin and it crashes through the ice. Hall and Armstrong explore the surrounding area but the man with them dies in an avalanche and they return to find the rest of the crew dead. The sound effects do get tedious but try watching Paramount's \"The Studio Murder Mystery\" thunderstorm scenes and you will find this movie isn't so bad. Primitive sound effects was a great leveller of studios both big and small. Meanwhile Miriam is brought up to date by constant newscasts and it is only at the end with the inevitable drawing room showdown that the film becomes static and betrays it's early talkie status. Even the clich\u00e9d scene where Hall forces Armstrong to return to base and a hero's welcome while he faces the unknown is spruced up with a twist in the last few minutes.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

                "text": "\"The Lost Zeppelin\" is a fascinating story when you think about it. Although the sound effects are a bit crude (such as the droning engines), the sound quality is actually very, very good for 1929. Silents were on their way out, but the quality of sound was still very poor and the fact that you can actually clearly hear the dialog is a major plus--this is NOT the case today when you see many 1929 flicks (such as \"Coquette\"--an Oscar-winner but with horrible sound). It also has awfully nice special effects for 1929. While today they could do much better, for 1929 it was nice.\n\nUnfortunately, while the film has its technical merits, the story itself is only fair. Part of the problem is the subplot involving the unfaithful wife and the captain--it just didn't make any sense--especially his reaction when he caught her with one of his officers. The other problem is that despite being an action story, it's all rather slow and dull. It's not terrible...it's just not all that good. In many ways, the film is highly reminiscent of the Leni Reifenstahl film, \"S.O.S. Iceberg\"--a film that debuted several years after \"The Lost Zeppelin\"--and I am pretty sure the Reifenstahl film was inspired by \"The Lost Zeppelin\".",

                "text": "I struggled to stay with this film to see it to the end. I give it two stars just for a try at a plot. Besides some very good silent films of the 1920s, I've rated about a dozen talkies of 1929 from 7 to 10 stars. Those were all produced by Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and a British studio.\n\n\"The Lost Zeppelin\" was made by one of the 80 or so poverty row studios that existed in the early years of movie making. Tiffany-Stahl lasted longer than most, from 1921 to 1931, and turned out 70 films in that time. This was one of its last. And this film is a good example of why it and the host of poverty row studios didn't last. The few good directors and technicians that started in the lower echelons eventually made it into the big studios or went with a successful independent that would later make it big or merge into one of the other studios. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't bother to review a film I rate so low. But since this is now out on DVD, I thought prospective viewers might like more comment than has been posted on IMDb to this time. I won't urge folks not to watch this \u0096 but you should know what to expect before you plunk down cash to buy or rent it. Indeed, I had some inkling of what it was about, but I wanted to see it for myself. And, I'm glad I did \u0096 because I now know what the very cheap poverty row films were like.\n\nEverything about this film is poor, with the possible exception of the sound from the dialog. The sets are very amateurish and poor \u0096 such as an airplane door that slides open. No kidding \u0096 just like a sliding door in a house. Then, when a crew person opens the door, it starts to fall out of its track and he shoves it back. The airplane engine noise is some strange irritating sound created by sound effects, and doesn't sound anything like a plane engine. The film quality itself is barely watchable. The script is something that a third-grade student might create today. But the directing and acting are the very worst. \n\nConway Tearle and Ricardo Cortez had small movie careers through the 1930s. But those were mostly in B films. The rest of the cast are actors who couldn't make the transition from silent to sound. Virginia Valli had made more than 60 films in the silent era; but after this, she made only two more before retiring from films at age 35. That's when many of the best actors begin to shine. The acting is very hammy in this, and one can see long pauses and long glances at the camera \u0096 techniques used in the silent films to allow subtitles to show. While the voices of all this cast were OK, they apparently couldn't transition to real acting. There were many silent film stars who didn't succeed in sound films because their unusual voices didn't fit their images in the minds of the movie-going public. \n\nSo, this isn't likely to be very entertaining; but if you want to see an example of the hundreds and even thousands of early films that aren't around anymore \u0096 and of the type of films put out by the short-lived and over-night cheap studios, then you may enjoy watching \"The Lost Zeppelin.\"\n\nI found this bit of trivia that movie buffs might enjoy. Apparently, MGM bought Tiffany's original film library and used it for fuel in \"Gone with the Wind.\" It went up in flames in the scene of the burning of Atlanta. I doubt if it was very expensive kindling.",

                "text": "That this exsists at all is probably a minor miracle. Legend has it that David Selznick purchased all of the Tiffany-Stahl studio's negatives to utilize for the burning of Atlanta sequence in Gone With The Wind. Extant prints of films from this studio are rare, indeed. That aside, The Lost Zeppelin shows that the little studio was indeed trying to be up-to-date in marketing all-talking pictures. The dialouge delivery in the first section of the picture, before we get to the meat of the story, hearkens back to The Lights of New York (1928). Pregnant pauses and actors unsure about how to properly deliver dialouge are apparent. When the story gets to the dirigible party and their problems, the pace picks up and there are some pretty neat (for their time) effects. The studio must be praised for putting forth a story that is at once novel and original. This was released at Christmastime 1929 and it seems to have been successful in some quarters. In it's premiere in St.Louis, for example, the ads reported a take of $30,900 for the Christmas weekend. Pocket change today, but we must remember the time in which it was released. Conway Tearle and Virginia Valli are the top-billed players. The opening credits proclaim that this was \"Synchronized by RCA Photophone\". The print on the Alpha DVD was acceptably clear. In all, a film which will probably appeal to those who enjoy the early talkies. There are plenty of 20s fashions, hairdos and a huge radio in the living room of the heroine. Radio, in fact, is utilized throughout the film as a way to chart the progress of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin itself is neatly represented by stock footage and the use of some neat miniatures. This is not an expensive film to buy and will be entertaining to those who enjoy film history.",

It also cemented her image as a shimmering, radiant beauty, always well bred but with distinctive views of life and love. Mary Astor recalled that Ann \"was one of the first stars who disregarded her status on the set, she wore little or no make up and would not put up with special treatment, special chairs etc\". She was a hard worker and not a phoney.\n\n\"Life walked into the house today\" declares Linda Seton, when her sister, Julia (Mary Astor) introduces her fianc\u00e9e Johnny Case (Robert Ames). The Setons are extremely wealthy (they have a lift that takes them to each floor in their mansion) and money is their God. Johnny is just a regular guy, who comes from humble beginnings and feels life is there to be lived. Linda agrees with his philosophy and wants Julia to grab her happiness. Their brother, Ned (Monroe Owsley) is a cynical alcoholic who has given up trying to assert his own personality and is now completely submerged by his father - almost. Even though on the surface, Julia is eager to fall in with Linda and Ned's plans, at heart she is like her father and secretly wants Johnny to buckle under and take a place at the family firm. \n\nLinda wants to give Julia and Johnny a special party with just a few friends (Edward Everett Horton, Hedda Hopper), real people, not pretentious snobs, who will make it a fun evening. Next scene, a ball is in full swing and Linda is nowhere to be seen - she is defiantly throwing her small party in the nursery - the only room she has ever felt happy. By the movie's end Julia's grasping \"small\" nature is revealed - when Johnny rejects her father's offer of a job - Julia admits she doesn't love Johnny, his carefree attitude has turned her cold. It is up to Linda to rush to his side (he is sailing on the midnight boat) and give him the love and support he needs. She has a special message for Ned - \"I'm going to return you to life\" - and for the room in general - \"If he (Johnny) wants to sell peanuts - oh how I'll believe in those peanuts\"!!!\n\nThis is a wonderful, sparkling movie and Ann Harding is glorious in it. You forget how old the movie really is. Has Mary Astor ever given a bad performance - I think not and she is excellent as the unbending Julia. Monroe Owsley, whose forte was villains, the oilier the better gave a good performance as Ned. From the list of his movie credits big things were expected of Robert Ames, who played Johnny, but, unfortunately, he died of the D.Ts the following year.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

                "text": "... given its subject matter. This is not a precode at all. Rather it is the filmed version of a 1928 play that made perfect sense in the roaring 20's. This film could not be made before 1930 because sound films hadn't evolved to the point where dialogue and movement could be shown as they are here. It could not be made after 1930 for several years (It was filmed again in 1938) because depression era audiences would simply be befuddled at a young woman (Ann Harding as Linda) who is so unhappy and bored with her rich lifestyle while many in the audience would just want to know when they are going to eat again.\n\nThe story revolves around a rich young woman, Julia Seton (Mary Astor), who is returning home with her fianc\u00e9 (Robert Ames as Johnny Case), whom she has known for only ten days. The Setons are terribly rich - I mean how many homes have elevators in 1930? - and they are divided into two groups. The stodgy business centric part of the family that runs things headed by patriarch Edward Seton (William Holden - no not THAT William Holden), and the unhappy Setons who seemed trapped on a merry go round from which they cannot get off. These are Julia's two siblings, Ned (Monroe Owsley) who drinks heavily to deal with the fact that he has no say in his own life, and Linda (Ann Harding), free in spirit but not in deed.\n\nJohnny has a strange idea of how to live his life. He has been buying some stocks and as soon as he gets enough money together, he wants to go on \"holiday\". He wants the retirement part of his life to be when he is young, not just to have fun but to make sure that what he does for the rest of his life is what he really wants to do. Linda thinks this idea is grand, but fianc\u00e9e Julia just thinks this is a goofy notion from which she can eventually distract him.\n\nYou'll notice that from the moment they arrive, Johnny seems to spend all of his time conversing with Linda and that Julia spends most of her time conversing with her \"bucks on the brain\" Dad. Complications ensue.\n\nAnn Harding does have some dialogue and over the top moments that only someone as regal as she could pull off. Lots of actresses would have looked silly going on and on about how the playroom was the only place in the family mansion in which she was ever happy. Plus, she is making a BIG leap of faith in her final decision in the film. It is easy to see why Katharine Hepburn was cast to play Linda in the 1938 remake - they have very similar acting styles.\n\nLet me also compliment Mary Astor's acting here. As both Johnny's fianc\u00e9e and her father's daughter you are never quite sure where she is coming from up to the very end. \n\nEdward Everett Hornton and Hedda Hopper have a small but crucial role as a couple who are friends of Linda and have a sense of humor that most of the stodgy Setons do not appreciate, but are needed to show that Linda does at least have some allies in her life.

                "text": "Turner Classic Movies often shows the marvelous old film Holiday-- starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Doris Nolan. It's among the best films either of them made and it's certainly among my favorites. However, I recently learned that the movie is NOT the first version of the Philip Barry play. Back in 1930, the original movie was made which stars Ann Harding, Robert Ames and Mary Astor. \n\nThe plots of the two versions are pretty much the same. Julia brings her new fianc\u00e9, Johnny, home to meet her family. He's shocked to find out she's loaded...and I mean loaded! Her family has millions and is very prominent socially. This is a far cry from Johnny and his working class roots. However, they are in love and both plan on getting married quite soon regardless of their differences. Through the course of the film, it becomes obvious that Julia has plans to control and mold Johnny---plans which are very different from his plans. Johnny is a bit of a dreamer. He would like to make enough money so that he can then go on an extended break--to see the world, experience life and only then settle down into a routine. Julia, however, sees him working as a banker or financier--stable, dependable and dull. There is absolutely no way both can have their way. One, or both, must bend.\n\nIn this same wealthy family are Linda and Ned. Ned is a cynical sort who spends an inordinate amount of time drinking. He knows full well the sort of dreary life he has set before him and spends much of his time intoxicated in order to deal with it. As for Linda, she's much more of a dreamer--a free spirit living within a gilded cage. In so many ways, she seems more compatible with Johnny--though she's too decent a sort to try to come between him and her sister. So what's to happen? Will Johnny allow himself to be emasculated and lose all his dreams or will he and Julia end up living in some bohemian apartment while he 'finds himself'...or is there some other alternative?\n\nAs I mentioned above, the plots are virtually the same. What is NOT the same is the entire feel for the two films. The 1930 version is rather stagy and lacks the energy of the 1938 film. Much of it is because back in 1930, they were just learning how to make sound films and often they looked more like plays being recorded on film than a movie as we know of it today. Holiday (1930) definitely is much more stagy. The worst of it is probably with Linda. In the earlier film, Ann Harding (a very popular actress in her day but a mostly forgotten actress today) played EXACTLY like she was standing on a stage addressing the crowd. Her diction and delivery were anything but realistic. In contrast, Katharine Hepburn's Linda was vivacious and exciting. As for the rest, in the 1930 film the performances were generally better than Harding's but still lacked the freshness and quality of the later film. Overall, I'd clearly give the nod to the 1938 production. But, this is not to say the 1930 film is bad....it isn't at all. And, for film nuts like me (and I know there must be more of you out there), a chance to see both films is a real treat. If you are also a lover of old films, I have an exciting suggestion. See BOTH movies. \n\nHow can you see the original Holiday? There is a wonderful website called the Internet Archive (archive.org) where you can view or download public domain movies 100% legally and for free. When you go to the site, in the search bar, type HOLIDAY. It will then provide a link to the 1930 film and its download. It's available in a variety of formats and your computer probably will play at least one of them. As for me, I've long used Media Player Classic (not the program that comes with Windows--the free program from mpc- hc.org). I strongly recommend you download it if your video player on your computer doesn't allow you to play the films. Media Player Classic will play a wider variety of formats than the players that come with PCs and MACs. Then, you'll be able to watch just about anything from the Internet Archive--and there are many thousands of films as well as audio recordings and even old video games! All are free and some are amazingly good--too good to have just been abandoned to the public domain.",

                "text": "The 1938 remake benefits from a more assured production and, of course, Cukor's direction. And the two are surprisingly close: Whole swatches of dialog from 1930 are lifted more or less bodily (the 1930 version, most likely, did the same with the stage dialog). And it's a rather stagy early talkie, trying, but not very hard, to move the action around and make it more cinematic. What the early version does have is Ann Harding. She's so lovely, and her playing has, I don't know, a stillness, a contemplation to it; she seems to think very hard about what to say before she says it. It lends a certain gravitas to what is already a fairly serious comedy dealing with rather large issues--how to live one's life, and how one's choices affect those around one. Mary Astor is also miles beyond Doris Nolan, creating a multifaceted, complicated character out of what could come across as just a selfish sister. Robert Ames hasn't Cary Grant's polished comedy playing or looks, but he's credible, and Edward Everett Horton is delightful in the same part he played in 1938. It's a mellow, thoughtful movie, marred but hardly ruined by the primitive movie-making. And we're very lucky to have Ann Harding's Oscar-nominated Linda Seton preserved.",

                "text": "I was fortunate to see a rare screening of this (early) 1929 film. The lure for me was Jeanne Eagels, and her performance did not disappoint. Her screen presence is amazing - there is scarcely a performance from this early talkie period to compare it with. If Eagels was alive at the time (she died in October 1929), if Paramount had more clout with the MGM-dominated AMPAS at the time, she surely would have won the Academy Award for Best Actress (it went to Mary Pickford in one of the WORST performances of the period, in the nearly-unwatchable \"Coquette\"). Her final confrontation with her husband, one of the most dynamic pieces of film acting from ANY period, is alone worth the price of admission.\n\nThis film exists only as a work print, without final dubbed-in music and sound effects, which may be disconcerting to some viewers, but thank God Eagels' performance survives intact. The storyline is similar to the 1940 remake but without several plot variations imposed by the Hays Office, and in many ways this earlier film seems more modern, complete with a few profanities and obvious depictions of a brothel (that scene, with Eagels' character humiliated in front of a bevy of Asian prostitutes, is amazing). The casual racism of colonialists on display throughout the film may be off-putting when viewed today, but is historically and dramatically appropriate.\n\nRights to this film apparently belong to Universal, so the chance of its being distributed on DVD - along with the many wonderful Paramount pre-1934-code films, the brilliantly restored Technicolor \"Follow Thru\" and \"Paramount On Parade\", etc. - is slender-to-none. No studio cares less about its pre-1948 catalog, especially the Paramount titles, and we can only pray that whoever heads their video division will be replaced by someone who knows and loves this eminently under-exploited catalog. In the meantime, Run, don't walk if this is screened in your area, and experience this beautiful and vibrant star who influenced a generation of actresses (not the least of which, Bette Davis, who took much from Eagels).",

The only surviving talkie made by the legendary stage actress, Jeanne Eagels (whose skill as a Broadway stage actress was obvious in the delivery of her lines - particularly the final scene, which I found mesmerizing) cries out for a restoration! The print of the film I viewed had a very poor visual quality (although I could always discern the action), but became all the more tantalizing - this film probably looked great in 1929, and would still look wonderful in a refurbished print. For a very early \"talkie\", I was very surprised at how natural and \"unstodgy\" the dialogue is (and the soundtrack was remarkably clear and strong, with even a little bit of profanity, which I'm sure it raised a few eyebrows in 1929!) It is very unfortunate that Eagels' other talkie \"Jealousy\" is now lost, and all the more reason that \"The Letter\" (being the only sound document of this legendary actress) should have a wider distribution. I hope someone some day will spearhead such an undertaking. \n\nA 2011 update: I recently acquired the DVD release of \"The Letter\" from Warner Archives. It is a revelation - an amazingly good print, particularly considering it is mastered from what is apparently the sole surviving 35mm print. Some segments lack musical background, but the dialogue is intact, and the visuals are far better than I expected (or hoped for!). Congratulations and many thanks to Warner Archives for finally making this treasure available!",

The only thing I can add is that Bette Davis seems to not have so much modeled her performance in the remake, as to have modeled her own physical persona in general on Eagels, who has a subtle body twitch that Davis took to (delightful) extremes later on. Certainly Davis would have seen this original movie version, and may have even seen Eagels on stage in other properties.\n\nThe sound is very primitive in this early version. At first it seemed like the sound wasn't even working. But the problem is that there is no sound until the film gets to a scene that has dialogue. It would have been interesting to hear more ambient sound added so you would be less likely to notice the old-fashioned audio, but then purists might complain.\n\nNevertheless, the film is fascinating and so is Eagels. I saw the film with an Asian friend who liked the fact that the film doesn't shirk from racism. The sequence where the heroine delivers the letter to the dragon lady was fun to compare to the later version. The early version is a lot racier! Also, I must point out that Herbert Marshall, who appears in the later version as the heroine's husband, is very young and handsome as her murdered lover in this 1929 production.",

                "text": "Jeanne Eagels is one of those film figures who are notorious rather than famous. She was a beautiful stage actress who scandalised Broadway with her erotic performance as Sadie Thompson, the hooker in Somerset Maugham's \"Rain\". Her film career started promisingly, but her drugs addiction became increasingly difficult to conceal. By the time she made her last film, her arms and legs were nearly as thin as broomsticks, and she resembled a blonde skeleton. She died in her thirties. Like a few other movie figures (Houdini, George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice) her own movies are less well-known than the movie ABOUT her, in Eagels's case the bio-pic starring Kim Novak (who was much more beautiful than Eagels ever was).\n\n'The Letter' is Eagels's first of two talkies. Like her most famous role, this film is based on material by Somerset Maugham, and takes place in that same Oriental tropics milieu: in this case, Singapore. This early talkie is a very crude effort. There was apparently a music soundtrack which is now lost, so (except for one sequence) there's no music at all, and several sequences which *ought* to have music are now silent. Elsewhere, we see various exterior shots in which silent action (of a car moving soundlessly down the road, for example) contrasts jarringly with the dialogue sequences. One reel change occurs *during* a shot, when Mrs Crosbie (Eagels) takes the witness stand, so the last frames of one reel are repeated at the start of the next reel. On the positive side, this movie (filmed at the Astoria Studios in Long Island) creates a credible facsimile of the Singapore jungles.\n\nThis is the same story that was remade with Bette Davis, but there's one major difference. The remake begins with Mrs Crosbie (Davis) killing her lover: we don't know what led to this, and as the action unfolds we must decide whether she is lying. In Eagels's version, we see the argument between Mrs Crosbie and her lover, so we know the truth. The remake's gambit is much better.\n\nHerbert Marshall appears in both versions: here, as the murdered lover; in the remake, as the cuckolded husband. Marshall had lost a leg in the trenches of the Great War, and wore a prosthetic limb through his entire film career. In his later films, he had a clumsy lurching walk. Here, he rises from a couch quite gracefully. I usually like Reginald Owen, but here -- as the cuckolded husband -- he's stiff and mannered, lumbered with Victorian dialogue.\n\nThere are some regrettably racist comments about Orientals in this story, including the famous line 'Damn peculiar, these Chinese'. Eagels's character berates a Chinese woman as 'a vile yellow thing', and this really doesn't stand out from the mood in the rest of the film. The Issei actor Tamaki Yoshiwara, playing a Chinese man educated by whites, speaks his dialogue in one of the strangest accents I've ever heard: is this genuine, or did the director impose it on him? O.P. Heggie gives a fine performance in a contrived role, as the barrister who (implausibly) compromises his professional ethics by shelling out $10,000 of his own money to buy evidence illegally, without bothering to find out if his client will reimburse him. Did Singapore have $1,000 banknotes at this time? When Mrs Crosbie hands $10,000 cash to her enemy, the whole dosh is a mere handful of paper.\n\nSeveral American actors here play British roles with Yank accents. In her early scenes, Jeanne Eagels attempts an upper-class English accent: this is unfortunate, as we have so few recordings of her voice. By this point, her drugs addiction was running its course. In several scenes, Eagels stands awkwardly or fidgets: she's playing a woman who's on trial for murder, yet she acts as if she has more urgent business elsewhere. (Maybe a hypo and her next fix, waiting in her dressing room?)\n\nBut, in the magnificent last scene of this film, Eagels abandons the faux accent and shows the fiery talent that made her (so briefly) a great actress. Abandoning all her dishonesties, she tells the husband who has spent his life's savings to gain her freedom: 'With all my heart and all my soul, I still love the man I killed.' At this moment, Eagels is superb. What a shame that this great actress destroyed herself. For all its crudities, 'The Letter' is of vital historic importance, and I'll rate it 8 out of 10 ... mostly for that final scene.",

                "text": "Even though others have praised Jeanne Eagles generously for her acting in this early talkie, I must add my two cents and say that her performance is what great cinema acting is all about! It is essential to see and hear what was possible as early as 1929. This is the kind of realistic emoting that we associate with Bette Davis, starting with OF HUMAN BONDAGE (1934), but Davis wasn't the first. There can be no doubt that if Eagels had lived she would have stood a strong chance of becoming the greatest film actress of her era. She totally inhabits the role of the British plantation owner's wife who shoots her lover; watching her, acting as we know it, or surely as 1929 audiences would have known it, disappears. I consider her British accent to be flawless throughout, so I must disagree with those who claim it's fake. By the standards of the era, it was top notch -- subtle and reserved, fully appropriate to the character of a proper, snobbish well-bred English lady. When I think of bad British accents, I think of Barbara Stanwyck in THE LADY EVE or Winona Ryder in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula. And if some linguistic expert chimes in with some sort of technical \"proof\" that the accent is less than perfect, I will say that at least it never sounds forced. Additionally, Eagels has a delicate beauty, somewhat like Helen Chandler or Carroll Baker and a voice rather like a high-pitched Tallulah Bankhead which startles at first but eventually becomes one of her most distinctive and endearing qualities. All great actors have that outstanding mark, something that sets them apart. When she is called upon to deliver the emotional fireworks, she does so with her whole being, not just from the neck up. It is hard to tell sometimes if she is brilliantly improvising or reciting word-for-word dialogue, so real is the effect. She is so persuasive that the audience with which I saw the screening burst into supportive laughter whenever she told intricately clever and whopping lies to cover her crime.\n\nAside from Eagles, the film stands up as an intelligently filmed version of a play, with its own logic, careful structure, and pace, a good sense of 1920's Malaya, an honest script that refuses to gloss over the racism that indeed permeated the British colonials of that time. Actual Asian actors are used to powerful effect, specifically Lady Tsen-Mei who looks like a man in Oriental drag and Tamaki Yoshiwara as an amusingly eager young lawyer's assistant. Herbert Marshall and Reginald Owen fulfill the requirements of their respective roles as the lover and husband.\n\nSPOILER: The ending is just as powerful as the 1940 version, but without the moonlight knifing. After Leslie confesses that she still loves the man she killed, the film abruptly ends, and it makes sense that it would end thusly because Leslie must now live out her whole life knowing she killed the man she loved, tethered to a dullard whose presence she can barely tolerate. In this case, it's a living death as opposed to an execution. END OF SPOILER\n\nBut it is when the camera closes in tightly on Eagels, especially during her courtroom testimony and in the final showdown with her husband, that THE LETTER achieves cinematic glory. I give this a \"10\" because it's the only documentation with sound and image of this immortal artist and therefore is a must.",

In fact, some of the very same dialogue is used. There is one major difference - we are shown the wild and hard side of Leslie Crosbie (Jeanne Eagels) right from the start, not left until the end of the film to guess exactly what really lurks behind the face of the crocheting angel we are presented in the 1940 version.\n\nAt the beginning we watch her bid her bland husband (Reginald Owen) goodbye as he heads to work. She makes sure he is gone and then writes the famed \"letter\" to her lover, Geoffrey Hammond, demanding he appear. In a clever bit of casting, here Hammond is played by Herbert Marshall, and very convincingly so. In 1940, the same actor plays Leslie's loving and trusting husband, also convincingly. What a great tribute to Marshall's range as an actor. You get to see Hammond with his Eurasian mistress (in 1940 the production code demanded they be married) complaining about Leslie, but saying that he must go see her one last time and put an end to her illusion that the affair is still on. You see the entire exchange between Leslie and Hammond - a conversation between a woman in love and a man who has moved on. You then see her deliberately pump a multitude of bullets into Hammond, which is where the 1940 film begins. The look on Leslie's face as she fires is the same in 1929 as 1940, but here we get to see the reason for that blank expression - it's not shock from an attempted sexual assault, it's payback for rejection.\n\nThe rest of the film plays out pretty much like the 1940 version, up until the end when Robert discovers he is too impoverished to buy his own plantation and must continue on working for the company, all because Leslie was guilty all along and had to pay blackmail to insure suppression of her last letter to Hammond. Robert tells Leslie that her punishment will be to stay in the home where the murder took place, haunted by her memories of both love and death. She, however, has one more bullet - a verbal one - this time aimed at her husband Robert. She tells him \"with all my heart I still love the man I killed\". Here, Leslie says this to lash out at Robert, to make sure that if she is stuck with him he realizes he is equally stuck with her. In 1940, Bette Davis says it as a woman whimpering out one last confession to her husband to profess that she is not worthy of the love of a man for which she feels nothing.\n\nBoth movies are very effective, but this one just has a realistic edge to it that was not possible in the 1940 one. It's just too bad that the existing copies I've seen are in such poor shape, but it's still very much worth watching.",

It was necessary because most of the principals were on Broadway at the time. The play, by W. Somerset Maugham, had little action but was centred on secrets and lies. There was an attempt to create an atmosphere of steamy tropical langour and Oriental streets. \n\nBette Davis played Leslie Crosbie with far less vigour and believability than Jeanne Eagels. Jeanne Eagels plays the bored and restless Leslie Crosbie who turns to another man, Geoffrey Hammond (Herbert Marshall) for attention when neglected by her husband Robert (Reginald Owen). Robert decides to go out for the evening to pick up a new rifle. Leslie's calm vanishes as she awaits an answer to a letter she has written Hammond. He has found a new love - a beautiful unscrupulous native woman Li Ti (Lady Tsei Mei) and has discarded Leslie. The scenes in the opium den are quite startling. After a blazing row Leslie shoots him - it was an amazingly realistic scene and was probably strong stuff for it's day.\n\nThe next scene shows Leslie in the witness box in all her stiff upper lip English glory. This film is told differently than the 1940 one. You know from the start that Leslie is lying but the thrill is in anticipating \"the letter\" and all it's consequences. In the 1940 film Gale Sondergaarde seemed more of a symbol and didn't have very much dialogue. Li Ti was a more rounded character in this film. When Leslie goes to buy the letter, she is taunted and humiliated by Li Ti and the prostitutes. The ending was quite sensational as Robert, now penniless because of \"the Letter\" forces Leslie to spend the rest of their married life living with her hated memories. She then tells him the truth \"With all my heart and soul, I still love the man I killed\"!!! Jeanne Eagels makes it so powerful that even though the copy I have is of appalling quality, I couldn't take my eyes off her for an instant - she is absolutely mesmerizing.\n\nHighly, Highly Recommended.",

Eagels is told she disgusts Marshall, who has replaced his blonde English mistress with a Chinese woman. Eagels thinks the native woman is \"common\" and \"vulgar.\" Declaring she still loves Marshall, Eagels decides to take matters into her own hands. This gets her in trouble with the law. Covering herself, Eagels convincingly hides her secret \u0096 but her Asian rival \"Lady\" Tsen Mei holds \"The Letter\"...\n\nFor her first \"talking\" motion picture, Eagels wisely agreed to star in W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Letter\" for producer Monta Bell and debuting director Jean de Limur. Eagels' greatest Broadway success had been in Maugham's steaming \"Rain\" (1922-26), which was filmed with Gloria Swanson as the hit silent \"Sadie Thompson\" (1928). Considering her success with this film, Eagels would have likely been considered for the sound version of \"Rain\" (the part went to Joan Crawford) and further acclaim. However, she had addictions and overdosed after one more film (the presently unavailable \"Jealousy\"). Notably, Marshall appeared in both the 1929 and 1940 versions, but as different characters...\n\nAs many have noted, Eagels shows the effects of drug use in her final films, but it works for the character she plays in \"The Letter\" \u0096 she is desperate and wasting away in a remote location. While employing some stage overplaying at times, Eagels still delivers an electrifying performance. She certainly earned her \"Academy Award\" consideration, and had the skills to continue into the sound era. This film was famously re-made in 1940 with William Wyler directing and Bette Davis starring. That version is much more polished, and Ms. Davis is likewise stunning. This 1929 version is incomplete and rough in spots, but still enjoyable. The racism is much less confusing, herein; there are scenes and situations which seem to be white-washed for the 1940 version.\n\n******* The Letter (3/17/29) Jean de Limur ~ Jeanne Eagels, O.P.

And here, Hammond is played with gusto by Herbert Marshall, who played her husband, Robert Crosbie, in the later version.

I assume it's this 1929 version with Jeanne Eagels since later Post-Code films demanded that evil be punished. Regardless, the later and more famous Bette Davis version is almost like an entirely different story\u0097it's that different. And, it's a bit better.\n\nWhile the Davis version begins with that wonderful shooting scene and you THINK the wife shot the man in self-defense initially, this is not the case with the 1929 film. The wife is an adulteress and a cold one at that. Additionally, the ending of the film is completely different because the 1929 version leaves the woman with little punishment for her evil deeds and in the Post-Code Warner Brothers version she clearly gets what's coming to her. One version is a bit dissatisfying, the other perhaps a bit too neatly wrapped up! So which film is better? Well, clearly I think it's the Davis version. Part of it is Davis' wonderful acting (it's one of her best) and part of it is because the Warner version just looked a lot better and had better production values. This isn't surprising, as in 1929, incidental music was practically nonexistent and the films were just shifting over to sound in Hollywood. Also, while the earlier version is certainly a lot grittier, most folks (including me) might feel a bit let down by its inconclusive ending. Still, Jeanne Eagels did have an excellent performance as well and the film has a certain steamy charm. It's still worth seeing but dramatically different from the remake.",

In the later film, with Davis as Leslie, she is killed at the end of the movie as punishment for adultery and murder by the Chinese woman from whom she bought the letter she had written. We might blame the Production Code for this melodramatic punishment, but it was repeated, at least in implication, in 1982 in the version with Lee Remick. This was not in the original play, in which Leslie intends to try to make her husband happy and hopes he will forgive her, even though she does not love him. The 1929 version with Eagles, however, gets the award for having the most unpunished and unrepentant Leslie. The husband says Leslie will have to stay with him and continue to be bored and lonely, and she responds by saying she still loves the man she killed with all her heart. Also, in the Eagles version, when Leslie goes to get the letter, there is a disturbing scene where prostitutes are kept imprisoned behind bamboo bars.

Sad to say this and another sound film are all we have of her acting and stage presence. Eagels was most famous on stage for doing another W. Somerset Maugham work, Rain. After seeing this what a shame it was she died of too much living before doing a film version of that. Joan Crawford was unjustly criticized for essentially not being Jeanne Eagels, so vivid was the memory of what she did on stage with Sadie Thompson.\n\nShe doesn't do too bad with Leslie Crosbie either in this film. Eagels is the bored wife of rubber plantation owner Reginald Owen and she casually drifts into an affair with Herbert Marshall. But Marshall has been two timing Eagels with a lovely Asian mistress. After deceiving her husband she's not about to be thrown over for an Oriental so she empties a revolver into Marshall. In the Bette Davis version Marshall plays the wronged husband and the character of the lover is only shown at the beginning being ventilated with six bullets.\n\nEagels gets the best barrister in Singapore O.P. Heggie, but there is the nasty business of an indiscreet letter she wrote to Marshall that the Chinese woman now has. Therein lies the tale.\n\nSomerset Maugham if anything was more observant of the racism in the British colonial community in this version than the later one. What's driving Eagels is the thought of being tossed aside for an Oriental woman, the type she employs as servants and looks down on. Not to mention the scandal of her affair and what would happen to her position in that strict British white colonial society.\n\nEagels gives a dynamic performance in her confrontations with the various male characters and in a soliloquy in court where she recounts a version for the jury as to why she killed Marshall. Of course it's all lies and the white jurors want to believe her. But that letter should it get out, she's toast.\n\nShot in Paramount's Astoria studios, The Letter shows its age, but even as she overacted as most of her Broadway contemporaries did when they faced sound cameras, her dynamism is undeniable.

It's my understanding that there was a good amount of music associated with this movie when it was released and you can kind of tell this because there are empty segments. Jeanne Eagles, the main reason I wanted to see this film, does a pretty good job overall. 1929 sound movies have a tendency to creek, but this one really doesn't. She is clearly the star of this vehicle. She shoots lover Herbert Marshall several times, killing him. She lies like a rug under oath at her trial, where she is found not guilty. She also informs husband Reginald Denny that she still loves her deceased lover, despite the fact that he informed her, shortly before being shot to death, that he did not love her even a little bit! Oh, and then there's the letter. She had written this to Marshall, but since he was dead, his Chinese housekeeper/mistress has it. Eventually, she has to pay the mistress $10,000 for the letter. Yes, there is racism in the film, but also racism in reverse. After the mistress receives the money, she drops it on the floor and when Jeanne stoops down to pick it up, the mistress says \"White woman at Chinese woman's feet\" to the delight of an assemblage of Chinese women behind bars.

Jeanne Eagels as the wife, I agree with them, holds your attention with her wonderfully expressive face, particularly in the concluding scene. But she seldom gets beyond striking a stagey, melodramatic note, seldom convincing me that she was a real character speaking and not just an actress playing a big part. Her nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role speaks volumes about the state of acting in 1929. And she's not the only actor whom you see pausing between sentences unnaturally, as if trying to remember the next one or perhaps waiting for the audience to absorb the effect. \n\nBut the acting is far from the worst thing about this movie. Worst of all is the story, which is the sort of thing you would expect in some dime-store romantic comic for women. The 1940 version with Bette Davis manages to moderate the cheapness of the story somewhat with more natural performances, but this one goes full-out melodrama. It's not so very far from Snidely Whiplash tying Poor Nell on the railway tracks. Then the racism makes you cringe even more, with all the Brits viewing themselves as lords of the earth and talking of dirty natives and their vile surroundings. I wanted to strangle them. The two main Chinese characters are (1) devious and (2) vengeful. \n\nEven the production details can make your heart sink. A barroom scene has dancers on a stage performing some Hollywood choreographer's horrid travesty of an Indonesian dance, a dance which in real life is beautiful, dignified and stately turned into something cheap and supposedly seductive. The music is also a pitiful, dumbed-down Hollywood imitation of real Indonesian music. The barroom scene, for no particular reason other than to add to the luridness, includes a snake-charmer wearing a turban. As the snake is about to appear, the scene suddenly shifts to the outdoors and we are treated to some stock footage of a mongoose killing a snake. Totally unnecessary and out of place.\n\nIt is truly embarrassing to think that this film was actually nominated for an Academy Award.

When people think about THE LETTER they don't think about this version or the actual W. Somerset Maugham play but instead the 1940 remake, which featured Bette Davis in one of her greatest villain roles. This original version is going to be best remembered by film buffs because it was the first of two sound movies that Eagels made before her death from a drug overdose. It should be noted that the second film, JEALOUSY, is now lost so this is the only film that buffs have a chance at viewing. I think some film buffs have talked the performance up as something legendary but I personally wouldn't go that far. Eagels is certainly good in the part but there were a few moments where I thought she went over-the-top a tad bit too far but then perhaps she was really this hyped up from perhaps the drugs she was taking. I'm really not sure but there's no denying that there's a certain passion, fire and explosion that comes from the actress and I really enjoyed the scenes where she just gets so worked up that she explodes right in front of our eyes. Eagels is certainly the main reason to watch this film even with countless flaws. The biggest one would be the screenplay, which is paper thin from start to finish as none of the characters really have any development and the 60-minute running time doesn't allow much in terms of story. The remake certainly beefed up the story and that was a good thing because there's just not enough here to really carry anything. Another problem is the technical look of the film, which seems dated even by 1929 standards. Just take a look at some of the shots where it seems as if the cameraman was shaking the camera. Again, there were certain limits in 1929 but some of this ugly cinematography really doesn't have an excuse. I also wasn't too overly impressed with any of the supporting performances. Marshall, who plays the husband in the remake, comes off the best in his few scenes. Owen is a little too dull in the role of the husband but then again the screenplay really doesn't give him any good scenes. O.P. Heggie, best remembered for playing the blind hermit in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, isn't too bad here as the lawyer. The ending, which I won't spoil, comes pretty fast and quick and it certainly packs a nice little punch with how it concludes.

Could it be that some of the track was lost?The caf\u00e9 sequence had oriental music as the back ground, then when eagles goes in to the slave brothel to get the letter back the back ground music stops.Also world confusing in that scene too.

So what ?The actress, who plays Herbert Marshals love interest, Is a real oriental actress, I think Japanese. The other one , that plays a strong part was born in Canton China. Most of the oriental character are of orient in birth but playing different orientals.This is what is called by us opponents of political correctness, artistic license. Even in the brothel scene Chinese prostitutes , in their cell,Take a stand against Jean Eagles character , who's prejudice, as the Madam makes Eagles pick up the letter that she , The Madam, throws on the floor, groveling at the Madams feet.Now in the beginning of the scene, Jean Eagles acting is the same technique as John Gilbert's acting in His Glorious Night. She over acts a bit. But during the trial sequence, all of a sudden she acts the way she should of acted all through the picture, natural. Why did she not act this way all the way through?

Was she on drugs during these scenes?, Boy you can see her rib cage on her chest thin.My guess on the stage she used that John Gilbert technique, which was popular in the twenties.But by today's standards of stage acting it's slightly over acting.

The boys treat the officer to a meal, but when Stanley pulls out the wallet to pay, the cop recognizes it as his own. Rather than running them in as pickpockets, he pays his own tab and leaves Stanley and Oliver at the mercy of the gruff headwaiter."

It begins with the boys working as street musicians to earn money but they are pretty unsuccessful--and their choice of tunes probably isn't helping any during the snow storm. The deaf joke at the beginning wasn't politically correct, but it was pretty funny. In a rather dark bit later in the short, Laurel and Hardy invite a cop to lunch after the boys find a wallet. Well, it wasn't very surprising WHO the wallet turned out to belong to, but what set this apart was the awful restaurant and how they dealt with deadbeats. I'm sure this sort of joke was a product of the times, given that the Depression had been on for about a year. While the film takes a very leisurely pace and not a lot of bold action occurs, there is a lot of charm and the gags are timed very well--and this is definitely classic Laurel and Hardy.",

H.M.

Highlights include L&H's encounter with hatchet-faced Blanche Payson, who responds with violent abandon to an errant snowball, and a surreal ending which closes proceedings on a slightly cryptic note (modern viewers will have their own idea what Stan whispers into Ollie's ear during the closing moments!).

Unlike other Comedians, Tragedians and Comedy Teams, the Boys took the New Era of Sound Films all in stride. Unlike others whose voices were deemed to be inconsistent with their screen image, and hence unfit to be used in the Talkies. There would be no going back from this point.\n\nSo we now had the Laurel & Hardy'modus operandi, which had been developing for about 4 years by this time. But now we can hear them; laughing, crying and delivering some very fine humor. Verbal humor would be added to the battery of Big Humor Guns. And, thank your Lucky Stars; the voices fit their visual images.\n\nAs for our film, we first have to comment on the chosen setting. BELOW ZERO, though it was undoubtedly filmed at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City (?), in Suburban Los Angeles, sunny Southern California. But it really felt Cold!! The falling 'snow', the 'snow' on the ground, the ice topped rain barrels all appears to be the McCoy! And, Brother, here in Chicago, we do know our ice, snow, sleet and slush.\n\nThe boys are cast as street musicians who are out on this particular Winter day, bravely and persistently hanging in there. They continually seem to be starting the same tune over and over again, Stanley on the Keyboard and Ollie plunking the Bass Fiddle to the tune of \"In the Good, Old Summertime!\" And all the while that they played, the snow kept falling, the Winter wind kept a blowin' and their teeth kept a chatterin'.' The one actually opening gag about their playing so long and compiling no gratuities; only to find that they were camped right in front of this one building. Though there was plenty of pedestrian traffic, they all seemed to just ignore the Boys. It was only when they decided to move on; Ollie discovered the placard on the one building which read: \"Deaf and Dumb Institute!\" This may seem a trifle in bad taste to us; and has been criticized by many. Especially today in our world of Political Correctness, where everyone seems so up tight about everything! In BELLOW ZERO the gang at Hal Roach Studios did a fine job of putting in the right ingredients into the mix. We see the boys engaged in some sort of work and no doing so well. We have the usual interplay, give and take between them. We have their getting in trouble with some tough hood, only to have the Cop come to their aid. But it seems that Laurel & Hardy usually go afoul of the Law and in this they do not disappoint. Finally they get into trouble with the tough restaurateur, ultimately winding it all up with favourite ploy, the Sight Gag, and then it's fade out, music, ending credits.\n\nWith the release of BELOW ZERO, the team now had a sound short to use as a barometer for all subsequent Sound Shorts.",

The victims of depression in a snowstorm, there's even a touch of Chaplin in certain elements. The short is still heavily indebted to the silent era, and all the better for it, inspiring greater pathos. The first, and most successful, half of the film contains less than twenty lines in over ten minutes of running time.\n\nStan's completely gormless expression while playing the organ had me in stitches, as did the inanity of the music. His morbid fascination with the unfortunate and deformed sees them playing in front of a deaf and dumb institute and ending with his belly swollen and distended. In one of their most blatant displays of toilet humour, he also apparently mimes needing to go to the lavatory as the climax. Freudians would even have a field day with Ollie's phallic weapon, while there's also time for a joke about a blind man in there as well.\n\nThe second half sees them find a wallet in the street, and treat a helpful policeman to a slap-up meal with the proceeds. Despite this being one of the Laurel and Hardy movies with the most integrity, make no mistake: it is also highly amusing. There's even touches of surrealism with Stan's multi-pocketed wallet, and, while scant, some clever wordplay. Recommended.",

Then there's a real large woman who puts a kibosh on the whole thing by throwing the instruments in the street. So with no means of getting paid, Stan discovers a wallet on the ground. Before a thug threatens to take that away from them, a cop arrests him and gets offered dinner from the grateful boys. I'll stop there and mention that with this being in the early talkie era, there's a minimum of dialogue between Laurel and Hardy as most of their humor is still visual with the gradual slapstick building in fine form throughout the first 10 minutes before the more dramatic part with the cop comes in. But there's one freak ending that Stan especially is fond of that ends this short hilariously. So on that note, I highly recommend Below Zero. P.S.

It's one of the funniest shorts by the men I have yet to see.\n\nLaurel and Hardy are a couple of petty street musicians, performing in subzero weather and not even making a dime. When they are informed by a police officer (Laurel and Hardy regular Frank Holliday) that they are in a crime-ridden area, the two decide to treat the police officer to lunch at the finest restaurant. It isn't until they finish their meal and are acquainted with the bill do they realize a grave mishap has happened that could only infer false intentions.\n\nBelow Zero, in a way, feels like a satire of manners for this time period. By today's standards, even at their most foolish, Laurel and Hardy always use gentlemanly, proper language, but when they are out to lunch with the police officer, such language transcends the boundaries of self-parody, which is funny in its own right. Something about the brazen silliness of Below Zero combined with its uncanny ability to be so formal provides for a very tongue-in-cheek edge to Laurel and Hardy I'm not sure I've witnessed before.\n\nThe short also is helped by some uproariously funny situational humor, specifically the ending and the very beginning, when Laurel and Hardy discover why they have yet to make a dime despite performing for two hours. All of this, encapsulated in a zealous pace with two charismatic men at the forefront, makes Below Zero so charming and watchable and among one of the finer shorts of the Laurel and Hardy lot.\n\nStarring: Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and Frank Holliday.

Walking away, the boys find a wallet on the ground, and after helping to catch a possible thief, a Policeman (Frank Holliday) lets them buy him something to eat. After finishing their steaks, the Policeman offers to pay, but Ollie insists they will, and Stan notices the wallet owner's photo, it's the Policeman! He finds out, and they know they can't pay, so they get thrown out, with Stan going into a (frozen) water barrel, and drinking all the water to have a big belly. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian.

                "text": "\nSilent film veteran John Stuart Robertson, once called the most well-liked director in Hollywood, had already guided John Barrymore , Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish in major projects. Here, under his sensitive direction, Garbo blooms in a relaxed and radiant performance, as she never did in her stodgy Clarence Brown vehicles. Was Robertson the silents counterpart of Cukor?\n\nAs a socialite seeking to \"live honestly\", Garbo first has a frank dalliance with her chauffeur, then meets artist Nils Asther--who apparently lives in an art gallery and paints exactly like Gauguin--and impulsively decides to sail to the South Seas on his yacht (although we only see Catalina, Robertson conveys a bracing sun-and-salt air quality from the shipboard locations). Returning to a somewhat scandalized reception in San Francisco, she marries local dullard John Mack Brown; meanwhile, the artist travels to \"fever-haunted\" China (where his hair inexplicably develops a white streak). Her final conflict is to choose between mothering her darling son or running away with the love of her life. What would Louis B. Mayer do?\n\nDespite some talk about the \"philosophy of love\" and the injustice of the double standard, this is hardly Tolstoy: the film stays within the conventions of a novelette, never seriously threatening the social status quo. Still, the pleasures are many: graceful direction and nicely underplayed acting throughout, plus Garbo, at the peak of her beauty, in an elegantly tailored Adrian wardrobe, giving one of her most appealing performances.\n",

                "text": "Before I will comment on this significant film with Greta Garbo and Nils Asther, let me make a short biographical notion.\n\nMany biographers of Greta Garbo, including Barry Paris and Karen Swenson, note that she came to Hollywood with her mentor Mauritz Stiller in September 1925... Although she was already a trained actress (having made two significant projects in Sweden and Germany), what she found in MGM was very different from what she experienced in Europe. The roles she was given, though being sometimes very successful roles (including the ultra popular Felicitas in FLESH AND THE DEVIL), were in majority the roles of vamps and temptresses. But Garbo...she disliked playing 'bad women.' When, in her prolonged contract, Garbo started to have a word in the roles she played and rejected some unattractive ones, more sophisticated projects appeared... \n\nOne of such refreshing projects was, undeniably, THE SINGLE STANDARD. One the one hand, a movie appears to be ignored in many analysis of her film career (it appears to be forgotten by some Garbo fans as well); on the other hand, the movie is strangely an 'oldie' that many modern viewers find entertaining and appealing.\n\nIt seems that the reason why this film is, at least, \"known\" among the fans of silver screen productions, is the pairing of Greta Garbo and Nils Asther. Indeed, both give tremendously convincing performances that still, after those decades, maintain their desirable authenticity. Who can possibly skip their unforgettable moments on the islands of eternal sunshine? How can we ignore their memorable chemistry when experiencing the Philosophy of Love? Who can ignore the perfect tension when the hearts are there but duties elsewhere...? Yes, Nils Asther appears to be one of the best co-stars Greta Garbo could ever play opposite.\n\nAnother reason, I think, is Greta Garbo herself and her unforgettable moments throughout the film. Although the close-ups are not that outstanding like in her top productions of the 1930s, there are pretty pearls that should not be skipped at least by Garbo fans. For instance, this is the moment of her walk in rain when she humorously states: \"I want to walk alone...\" These are her unforgettable facial expressions when 'naughty men' come filled with wit having dated their delicious mistresses. This is, generally, the feeling she put in any kind of portrayal she did before the camera. But, here, let me concentrate more deeply on the role of Ms Stuart that Ms Garbo so beautifully portrays since there is one more rarity about the Swedish Sphynx: the power of THE SINGLE STANDARD lies specifically in the \"refreshment\" of Garbo's masterful acting. \n\nArden Stuart is a woman who, on the other hand, wants to be independent from men but, on the other hand, learns to understand what living for others means. Although she wants to walk alone, she does not live her life all alone (though she has some great time on All Alone ship). She does not accept any \"half measures\" and treats life seriously being very genuine in what she does. As a free woman, Arden opens her heart to...love. However, this love will make her stand before the most important decision of her life... Among many scenes that remain in one's memory, including Arden's scenes with her child, I would like to share one moment with you, the moment that truly left a trace in my mind and in my heart. This is the moment when Arden has a trip with a chauffeur and she says that there is no difference whether it's a girl, a man but both have right to... life. It is the viewpoint that very well fixed to Garbo, to her powerful belief in personal freedom and happiness. Although some say that \"Garbo plays a normal woman\" in THE SINGLE STANDARD, I would say more: \"Garbo plays a sophisticated human being\" in THE SINGLE STANDARD, a human with her fears, her feelings, her decisions and reflections, her heart.\n\nOther aspects are, perhaps, not greatest merits of the movie (with some exceptions). It is true that the cinematography is not of top quality. The same may be said about some supporting roles. But here, two things may also work well for the film nowadays: firstly, it is the short length of THE SINGLE STANDARD which does not bore people; secondly, it is the tension - the viewers' attention is kept thanks to the wonderfully roused interest.\n\nAt the end of my review, I would like to add one thing from me, personally. I would like to ask you not to treat my words as the ones said by a Garbo fan who tries to convince viewers to see yet another \"oldie\" with the greatest actress of all time. Although I consider myself a great Garbo admirer, I say it with all my heart: you do not have to be very knowledgeable about Greta Garbo and you may still see this film with great pleasure finding something for yourself. That is what I wish you from my heart. I rate the film 8/10",

This is mostly due to the fact that I don't think the characters or the background are developed enough to make the whole cohesive.\n\nA case in point is the suicide of the chauffeur in the beginning of the movie. He and Arden (Garbo) are having a love affair, but for some reason, when he's dismissed, he inexplicably wrecks the car, committing suicide. I was wondering, \" What in the world!\" because there wasn't enough background on this character to understand why he would make a decision like that.\n\nArden believes in, as she puts it, \" living life freely, without restraints,\" and we believe at the end of the movie that she is going to sacrifice her husband and adorable little son to do that, but she makes the traditional choice and stays. I realize that was the best decision and I don't think the audience would've had much sympathy for her had she gone away with Packy (Asther), but I wonder if that's the choice her character would realistically have made given what we know about her before.\n\nThis movie is beautifully photographed and lit, and the secondary actors are enjoyable as well! ( Johnny Mack Brown is a doll!)The director John S. Robertson gets a sensitive, restrained performance from Garbo. The love scenes are idyllic and tender.\n\nWatch this one for the Greta and Nils, but the story doesn't completely gel for me! P.S.

Her character, Arden, who seems to have no parents, and who seems to exist effortlessly and rather detached among the high society set, has a brief romantic fling with her chauffeur, which causes scandal among the posh set, when the driver, fired, takes his own life. \n\nArden next finds \"love\" with rogue artist Packy Cannon, played passionately, but a little shallowly, by handsome Nils Asther. Nils tempts her to join him spontaneously on a pleasure cruise, and we do get a few hints as to what pleasure Packy is up to with Arden, but really, their passion is quite restrained, considering what modern day films splash on the screen. After Packy has compromised Arden, he callously decides he \"loves\" Arden too much to continue seeing her, and orders the boat turned around. Arden is heartbroken, deposited back onshore like an old and weathered boat rudder.\n\n\nShe next finds \"love\" with an old admirer, Tommy, played sweetly and sensitively by anything-but-dull, good-looking Johnny Mack Brown. He proposes and, on the rebound from Packy, she accepts. Three years later they have a child together and a very happy marriage. It was nice to see Greta playing a normal woman who eventually puts her marriage first before her old flame, just like most normal American women would do today. There is no compromise here, Arden simply makes the wisest decision for all concerned, which is ultimately based on true love, for true love always endures perfect sacrifice.\n\nThe print is rather deteriorating in spots and quite scratchy, but really, after you have seen as many silents in poor condition as I have, this one is still above average. It just goes to show how the studios blatantly neglected their silent classics once sound came in, letting them deteriorate or disappear into rust. A tragic and short-sighted waste.\n\n\nIt was nice to see other silent film actors like Dorothy Sebastian (Spite Marriage) and Mahlon Hamilton (Little Old New York) in the cast, albeit in small roles. The musical score was the old Vitaphone one but still rather elegant, though I wouldn't say it was beautiful, as the other reviewers here have stated. \n\nIf you are a Garbo fan or a fan of nicely made silent films, you will enjoy The Single Standard.

The plot is thin and like the later THE DIVORCEE, had to please the critics by having a\nconventional cop-out ending - the woman chooses husband and home over sexual freedom.  Thus the very spirit of the work is watered down.\n\nThere isn't much plot. Arden advocates a single standard, not man's double standard that what is okay for the gander is not okay for the goose. She has an affair with her chauffeur, who inexplicably commits suicide when confronted.  She then takes up with an artist (Packy Cannon), leaves for the South Seas with him, and after a time is dumped.  At home she faces scandal until she decides to marry ardent suitor, Tommy.  Of course Packy returns and wants her to abandon her husband and child and come away with him. The noble husband even plans a hunting accident to free her from making a decision.  Of course we know that Garbo will see the light and choose husband, home and child over the unreliable suitor.\n\nGarbo has a number of well lit close-ups here - nothing great but to her advantage.  She also emotes quite well and does a decent acting job. Nils Asther is okay as Packy and dull Johnny Mack Brown is appropriately dull and adoring as Tommy.\n\nThis is the second shortest of all Garbo silents (THE KISS is the shortest). The print used by MGM/UA for its Turner assisted 1990 release to home video is (like the print used for their THE MYSTERIOUS LADY release) a very used and scratched - and in some places deteriorating - one.   This is odd considering MGM/UA's other four Garbo silent video releases all make use of impeccably pure and luminous nitrate prints.  It may have been that the negative and archive prints had all decomposed and they had to make due with whatever was extant, regardless of the condition.    Viewers be warned that the condition of these two releases detracts from the enjoyment of the films.\n\nThis is for Garbo fans only.  It was her first \"modern\" role and she does well.   There's nothing here in terms of production design, cinematography, editing or the like to make it special, and it is Garbo's presence alone that has most probably kept this film from oblivion.",

                "text": "THE SINGLE STANDARD (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1929), directed by John S. Robertson, stars the legendary Greta Garbo in another one of many love triangle melodramas most associated with her during her reign on the silver screen. Coming at the tail end of the silent film era, for her third of four film 1929 releases (a busy year for Garbo), THE SINGLE STANDARD ranks one of her finer efforts with a familiar theme. Acquiring the support of John Mack Brown (who later achieved fame as a western movie hero through the 1950s) and Nils Asther as her leading men, each having previously appeared opposite Joan Crawford in OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS (MGM, 1928), the winning combination for this production happens to be that of Garbo and Asther.\n\nThe story opens quite amusingly with its introductory inter-title: \"For a number of generations, men have done as they pleased - and women have done as men pleased,\" followed by an opening shot of a group of married men coming out of their cars bidding good night to their lady friends, then returning to their prospective spouses as witnessed by d\u00e9butante, Arden Stuart (Greta Garbo), one of the guests at the social function. Although Mercedes Stuart (Dorothy Sebastian) loves Tommy Hewlitt (John Mack Brown), his interest is on Arden, a modern day woman not only believes in sexual equality for men and women. but prefers living her life honestly. That evening, Arden goes on a moonlight drive with Anthony Kendall (Robert Castle), a family chauffeur. Upon their return, Kendall is immediately dismissed by his employer regardless of Arden assuming the responsibility. In despair, Kendall takes his own life by speeding out the car of the estate and crashing it into a nearby tree. Three months after the scandalous tragedy, Arden, coming out of the rain, enters a museum where she encounters Packy Cannon (Nils Asther), a prizefighter turned artist, during one of his exhibits in an art gallery. Their courtship and travels on his yacht becomes a romantic and happy one until Packy decides he cannot marry Arden until his work is completed. After sailing out on his venture to the Orient, Arden encounters Tommy once more, this time accepting his marriage proposal. During their three year union, the Hewitt's are blessed with a child (Wally Albright). All goes well until Packy returns to Arden's life, leading jealous husband and former lover to come to terms fighting for her affection with \"coffee and pistols for two.\" \n\nOther members of the cast include Lane Chandler (Ding Stuart); Mahlon Hamilton (John Glendenning); Kathryn WIlliams (Mrs. Glendenning); and Zeffie Tilbury (Mrs. Hindley). Those familiar with actor Joel McCrea will easily recognize him as one of the three suitors during the opening sequence.\n\nRegardless of THE SINGLE STANDARD being taken from the novel by Adela Rogers St. John, the plot seems to borrow certain structures from Garbo's earlier works and recycling those taken from 1927s LOVE (based on \"Anna Karenina\") where the Garbo character, with a son she adores, finds herself torn between husband and lover; FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) where two men consider settling their differences for the woman they love by having a duel; or her most recent WILD ORCHIDS (1929), also featuring Nils Asther, where husband (Lewis Stone) schemes on a hunting trip with wife's lover, hoping for a convenient accident for one of them. Unlike these selected titles, Garbo's character is pitted between two men of equal age status here instead of middle-aged husband versus young lover. With these mixtures involved, THE SINGLE STANDARD survives on its own merits, resulting to a satisfying story equipped with original music score. Had THE SINGLE STANDARD been produced as a talkie, the locale, being San Francisco, might have been changed somewhere in Europe considering its leading players being of Swedish heritage with spoken accents. Their character names, Arden and Packy, unfitting for their personalities, might have served better for American MGM-types as Norma Shearer or Joan Crawford and John Gilbert or Conrad Nagel.\n\nIt's interesting to note how the word, \"Alone\" long associated with Garbo's image, turns up here. Many credit the line, \"I want to be alone\" from her 1932 classic, GRAND HOTEL (1932) as her most famous quote. Yet, in THE SINGLE STANDARD, coming three years earlier, includes an amusing sequence where she finds herself annoyed by a masher (Wade Boteler) while walking in the rain. She ends his persistence by telling him, \"I'm walking alone because I like to walk alone.\" The name of the yacht where Arden and Packy venture alone together is revealed to be \"All Alone.\" The only thing missing is the Irving Berlin song \"All Alone\" as its underscore.\n\nDistributed to home video through MGM/UA in the 1990s, THE SINGLE STANDARD, at 72 minutes, turns up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.(***)",

This is a very adult film and a great one.  Films like this were not made again until the 1970's--and nobody ever surpassed Garbo in this kind of role.\n\n\"The Single Standard\" was adapted from a novel by Adela Rogers St. John. Rogers St. John was the daughter of the famous trial lawyer Earl Rogers, who was the most famous criminal lawyer of the early years of the century and who died a hopeless alcoholic.  She never went to school, and simply hung around her father's law office, but later became a famous author and journalist.  The great film \"A Free Soul\" (1931) is based on  Rogers St.John's autobiography and chronicles her life along with her father's. Rogers St. John was, in her own life, very much like the heroine of \"A Single Standard\" and embodied the ideals of women's liberation in the 1920's.",

Still when Greta Garbo made The Single Standard her future in sound was still a subject for speculation.\n\nWith her Swedish accent it wasn't sure how it would register in sound. But watching The Single Standard Nils Asther and Johnny Mack Brown also had accent issues. Asther was also from Sweden and he's probably best known in talkies for playing the title role of a Chinese general in The Bitter Tea Of General Yen. He slipped back into B pictures and less with sound.\n\nSo to did Johnny Mack Brown. Brown was an All American from the Crimson Tide of Alabama and had an accent to match. He who was a leading man to Garbo and Mary Pickford among others quickly went into westerns and soon enough B westerns for his career. Silent films were a great leveler in casting. As long as you looked believable in the role, no speech limitations could hinder you.\n\nIt's why Garbo is playing an American socialite who is bored with her life and doesn't see why she shouldn't go out and sow wild oats like the men do. The Single Standard should apply to all.\n\nSo she dumps good old reliable Brown to have a fling with first her chauffeur and then artist/boxer Nils Asther.

In the film Garbo plays Arden Hewlett, a rich woman who believes that men and women should play by the same rules in terms of relationships. She doesn't have a problem with the boys running out on their wives and she expects the same. She eventually hooks up with a boxer (Nils Asther) but winds up with another man (Johnny Mack Brown) who she marries. Once married the boxer comes back into her life and wants her back. I'm sure this film was dated even by 1929 standards so it certainly doesn't play any better today. This isn't a horrible movie but at the same time everything in it is so bland that you can't help but be bored out of your mind. What's even worse is that the film lasts a short 73-minutes yet even that seems way too long. The only thing that really works here is the beauty of Garbo. She does a nice job in the role and she's easily believable as the \"fun girl\" every guy would want to be with. I thought Asther was also pretty good and what lively moments the film does have are due to the boat trip between his character and Garbo's. Brown isn't too bad but his role is so predictable that it comes off rather boring. Director Robertson really seems to be asleep at the wheel because there's no energy or life anywhere in the film. I'm not sure if the studio just made this production a quickie until they could find out what to do with Garbo and sound movies but in the end the film just doesn't work.",

However, THE FIGHTING PARSON turned out to be a memorable union.\n\nOur first appearance of Harry is inside a stagecoach entertaining the passengers with a charming ditty while strumming a banjo. The great comedians all seemed to had been musically proficient. Groucho played guitar to keep up with his brothers and Keaton played a mean ukulele. When Harry finishes his tune he immediately holds out his hand looking for tips. Since he is wedged between two disinterested people his hand moves from side to side to side looking for a response. It's a hilarious moment. This short plays up the description that only the Gods and fate can save this clown. Through a series of accidents that Harry has no control over he soon has an entire western town believing that he is the notorious fighting Parson. There is not a more implausible sight than a town of western toughs cowering while pasty-faced Harry is busy playing by blowing foam off of his beer mug. Since he has the run of the town he decides to entertain them all by once again taking out his banjo and goes into a spirited rendition of \"Frankie and Johnnie\". This is followed by an impromptu tap dance and it comes off just as charming as the off-the-cuff musical moments that would appear in the shorts of Charley Chase and Stan & Ollie.\n\nEventually Harry must face off against the town's bad guy and since this is a western setting we naturally assume guns will be involved. And for that very reason the boys settle their differences with a boxing match. The farcical tones of this short is ratcheted up another notch as Harry acquires two long poles for arms with boxing gloves attached to the ends. This abstract image is matched with Langdon's creative use of his new arms as he pokes, jabs, throws wheel barrel punches and even skips rope with them. It all ends up with this being one of the most entertaining of the Langdon-Roach shorts.",

                "text": "This amusing two-reel comedy is one of several made by Harry Langdon for the Hal Roach Studio, at the dawn of the talkie era. The quirky comedian, a great favorite with audiences just a few years earlier, had fallen on hard times and was going through a rough patch in his career. Even before the talkie revolution he'd been dropped from First National's roster after one too many flops; now, during the 1929-30 season, he badly needed to establish himself as a draw in talkies.\n\nI've seen several of the short comedies Langdon made for Roach. They're a mixed lot, but I'd say The Fighting Parson is one of the best. The Western setting works well for Harry, and the gags are pretty good, but what I really like about it\u0097and what makes it special as a sound attraction\u0097is that it shows off Langdon's musical abilities. In his very first scene, as a passenger on a stagecoach, Harry plays a jaunty banjo number and sings in his thin, piping voice. When he finishes, he holds out his hand for tips, but his fellow passengers are unmoved. Once he arrives at his destination, a saloon in a hardscrabble town, the musical performance continues. Through a mix-up, Harry is mistaken for the new parson. The townspeople expect him to lead them in \"Rock of Ages,\" but instead he launches into a peppy rendition of \"Frankie and Johnny,\" followed by an eccentric dance. Langdon spent many years in vaudeville before he entered the movies, and this pleasant sequence gives us a glimpse of what he learned in his stage days.\n\nThe plot of The Fighting Parson is both rudimentary and familiar: once we get past the mistaken identity business (reminiscent of Chaplin's The Pilgrim), Harry stumbles into a conflict with a local bully over a young lady, who was abducted and forced to work as a dance hall girl. For the finale, Harry and the bully settle their differences in an impromptu boxing match, highlighted by a surreal sight gag involving Harry's use of fake arms. Admittedly, some of the gags along the way are familiar from earlier Langdon films. For instance, when he accidentally consumes tobacco and becomes woozy, fans will be reminded of similar bits in The Luck o' the Foolish and His Marriage Wow. The ride in the stagecoach, surrounded by unfriendly people, recalls Harry's memorable bus trip in The Strong Man, and the lowdown dance hall milieu is a reminder of that film, too. But there's nothing wrong with reworking old bits in a new setting\u0097everyone did that, including Chaplin. What's nice about The Fighting Parson is that it recaptures a little of that old Langdon magic, the unique quality that made his best silent comedies for Sennett and First National so enjoyable.",

                "text": "It is interesting to watch Langdon retool and refine his on-screen persona through the transition from silent pictures to sound. In this Roach-era short, we see him in the process of finding his footing. \n\nMany viewers appear nonplussed by the opening stagecoach sequence, seeming to believe that Harry's protracted and incoherent babbling comprises the entire gag. Harry eats a sandwich that he thinks was filled with preserved meat by a fellow passenger when in fact, the stagecoach driver's tobacco plug is concealed between the slices of bread. As the scene progresses, Harry suffers from the increasingly unpleasant effects of nicotine poisoning and struggles to keep himself together in a situation that he can neither control nor understand. \n\nPlenty of other comedians have used this same bit - in fact, this sequence recalls an earlier Langdon short, THE LUCK O'THE FOOLISH. There, the gag culminates with a nauseated Harry crawling into traffic, obliviously placing himself in danger in an attempt to avoid discomfort, and then vomiting the offending sandwich into a fountain offscreen. Here, over-the-top slapstick perils are discarded, and the fear of being humiliated in social situations plays out in miniature. The emphasis is focused tightly on the character's discomfort, without recourse to wacky hijinks.\n\nLangdon frequently uses awkward, cruel or embarrassing situations to provoke laughter through unease. Here, he pulls a characteristically nasty bait-and-switch on his hungry character. As Harry suffers from nausea, palpitations and breathing difficulty, the other passenger's thoughtful offer of a turkey wing becomes a gesture of sadism. Langdon is frequently mischaracterized as a gentle, cute or precious comic, when in fact, his work is often quite cruel and bleak. \n\nIn this feature, Langdon seems to be restrained from prior missteps (LONG PANTS, anyone?) and does not aggressively pursue audience discomfort. Some truly charming song-and-dance bits are neatly paced and well integrated into the plot. Finally, the climactic wacky-boxing match uses cartoonish sight gags popular in the 1930s to explicitly Surreal effect. \n\nThis work suffers from sloppy editing that occasionally creates the impression of missing footage, and some awkward pacing seems to point to a struggle between Langdon's characteristic slow style and the need for a completed plot arc. \n\nNevertheless, I think this two-reeler is an appealing bagatelle, and I am perennially surprised by how many people seem to think otherwise. It seems that even Langdon's fans find his work polarizing.",

A veteran of the stage, he sings, he plays the piano and he performs a fine eccentric dance. Nor are the solid comedy technicians at Roach averse to helping him come up with one of his better surrealistic gags for the final big fight scene.\n\nFor some reason, Thelma Todd appears only in a few crowd shots.

His trying hard to look like a slightly addled child certainly didn't help.\n\nHere in one of Langdon's efforts for Hal Roach Studios, much of the time he follows this poor pattern. Many times (especially early in the film) he seems to just prattle aimlessly and at great length--as if that alone was somehow funny (which it wasn't). In particular, seeing and hearing him talk and talk and talk gibberish on the stage coach was pretty tough to endure. Following this, so often through the film Landgon just stared off into space--as if somehow that was funny. His comic timing was just dreadful and much of the film should have been edited to make it tighter and less long-winded.\n\nLater, a bit more happens--though it isn't necessarily funny. There's a slow-motion boxing match where he literally walks about as if he's on downers. And seeing his enormously long fake arms was, apparently, THE joke--not just part of a longer and funnier routine. It didn't make me laugh and was just rather dumb--but perhaps kids will laugh at this.\n\nThe bottom line is like the other Hal Roach shorts I've seen Langdon make, this one is just dreadful--and even worse than his later shorts for Columbia. After a promising career start, he settled into a life of awfulness that is just inexplicable--how could a guy who was once this funny now be this unfunny?! As a HUGE fan who has reviewed hundreds (if not more) early comedies, I am dumbfounded by this and find his later films practically unwatchable. Do yourself a favor and try his earlier films--they really aren't at all like this bilge.",

            "From a poor working class background, Juan de Dios is a cantina performer in Seville, singing and dancing with his partner Lola. They have a contentious professional and personal relationship, her jealous self who cannot tolerate his constant flirting. He really aspires to be a serious opera singer, he under the tutelage of Estaban. Once the greatest impresario in Spain himself, Estaban lost everything because of the same reckless behavior that Juan now exhibits, that behavior which Estaban is trying to quell in Juan. Estaban's plan is to get one of his old contacts in Madrid, an impresario, to manage Juan's career to get him serious singing gigs, leading to that fame and fortune Esteban once used to have. It's love at first sight when Juan meets Maria Consuelo Vargas. What he initially doesn't know is that their meeting was by no accident, as she, a postulant at St. Agust\u00edn convent who just escaped from that life, had been mesmerized by him and his singing every time she saw him as she peered over the convent wall to the cantina. As she tells him that she has no home, he takes her in. When he learns that she used to be a nun in training, he has to decide whether to marry her as is his want, or try to get her back to the convent. Factored into his decision may be her brother, Army Captain Enrique Vargas, who believes she is destined to be married to God, jealous Lola, and his and Estaban's own aspirations for his singing career."

The plot calls on him to sing a lot - and he does so quite brilliantly.  He is also called upon to go through some pretty heavy emotional stuff and he is nothing short of astonishing in these scenes.  Also he demonstrates his usual charm, wit and joy of life - and proves yet again that he deserved better material than MGM offered him.\n\nIt's easy to see why this sweet film was so popular in its day, and why it was re-made twice (in Spanish and French) in 1931, with Ramon starring in and directing both versions.  It's all impossibly romantic and quite charming.\n\nRamon's regular leading lady, Dorothy Jordan, is pretty good here, Ernest Torrence hams a bit as Ramon's dad, and Renee Adoree is wonderful in her last screen performance (she died very young of TB) - just as in \"The Pagan\" her love for Ramon is unrequited and she is ultimately self-sacrificing. Russell Hopton is, unfortunately, wooden as Jordan's brother and, as a consequence, his crucial climactic scene with Ramon does not work as well as it should have.\n\nCharles Brabin's direction and the screenplay are uninspired, but the film is worth seeing for Ramon Novarro's extraordinary performance.",

But Adoree gets even by finding Jordan's military brother who tracks them down and sends her back to the convent. Meanwhile Novarro is turned down by a local opera house because he's never had his heart broken and his singing has no soul. Torrence buys a night for Novarro to sing at the opera and he grudgingly does to, bringing down the house. But his heart is so broken he's actually dying until Adoree takes action.\n\nNovarro is quite good here, especially when singing. A few of the dramatic scenes are badly done, but the rest of the film is lively. Novarro co-wrote the song \"Lonely\" with Herbert Stothart. I have no idea what Novarro sings in the finale but he's good despite having rather thin high notes. It's quite a shock to see Torrence break out in song, but the burly Scottish actor, a dependable heavy in silent films, was a trained opera singer. Jordan and Adoree handle the music well.\n\nThere's a great scene where Torrence at the piano joins Novarro in a burst of song only to be joined by the landlady (Mathilde Comont).

                "text": "I watched \"Call of the Flesh\" (1930) a romantic, musical melodrama with touches of comedy, that was a huge surprise for me. Surprise, because after watching \"In Gay Madrid\" (1930) filmed and released earlier the same year and after re-reading the pertinent passages from Andr\u00e9 Soares' very good Bio on Novarro \"Beyond Paradise\" my expectations were low, since Mr. Soares believes \"In Gay Madrid\" (1930) to be the best film that Novarro made with co-star Dorothy Jordan. (the other one was \"Devil-May-Care\" (1929)). Well, I am sorry to totally disagree, but for me \"Call of the Flesh\" is simply one of Novarro's best talkies along with \"The Barbarian\" (1933), \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" (1934) and \"Daybreak\" (1931) - I'm not counting \"Mata-Hari\" (1931) because it's a Garbo vehicle and not really Ramon's film.\n\nMr. Soares and some other reviewers felt that Novarro plays an obnoxious, difficult to tolerate character, especially at the beginning of the film, but I found him most amusing and likable in a way. A sort of immature, mischievous, full-of-life young lad -much more appealing than Haines' truly obnoxious characters. Novarro is very charming and natural, in spite that some times he could be perceived by some to be a little bit \"too much\". For me he's fine.\n\nOn the other hand, the chemistry between him and Dorothy Jordan is far more effective here than in the previous film I saw. Ms. Jordan really redeemed herself in my eyes in terms of acting. She's no Duse, but she did fine and she conveys the innocence and charm of a naive convent girl who falls for life outside the convent and for Novarro. The musical interludes, singing and dancing are much better in this film and it has better production values. In terms of cinematography, camera movement, pacing and editing it's \"eons\" beyond \"In Gay Madrid\" (1930); definitely Charles Brabin and his crew did a much better job that Bob Z. Leonard and his' in the aforementioned film. \"Call of the Flesh\" (1930) doesn't look at all stilted, stiff and creaky like \"In Gay Madrid\" (1930) did. Probably by the time they filmed the former the crew at MGM had already learnt how to overcome those shortcomings.\n\n\"Call of the Flesh\" also benefits from an overall superior supporting cast, with Ernest Torrence fantastic as Novarro's mentor; ailing, lovely R\u00e9n\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e very moving as Novarro's fiery lover \"Lolita\" and Mathilde Comont hilarious as Novarro's landlady in Madrid.\n\nAdor\u00e9e was gravely ill with TBC and was in very bad condition during the making of the film (and one can see it; she looks very frail and thin). In fact she and Ernest Torrence died a couple of years after this film was finished. I think that it was her final film.\n\nThere are two alternate versions of this film: in Spanish and French, which I don't know if they are still extant, but I'd love to see.\n\nI was so surprised by this film (maybe, because I didn't really expect much), I enjoyed the romance, the musical interludes, the comedic touches, even the Operatic Arias (although like Jeanette MacDonald people who know about Opera, say that Novarro hasn't got a voice of a caliber enough to tackle such a challenge) and I was sincerely moved by the scenes towards the ending.\n\nAll in all, a rewarding experience.",

                "text": "I realize that this is an operetta from the first generation of early sound musicals, but the film could have benefited from tighter pacing and therefore a shorter running time. There is no portion of the movie that I would call padding - it all seems necessary to tell the story and maintain the atmosphere, but there are lulls here and there that are short in and of themselves that begin to add up. Plus there is virtually no back-scoring in this film, also typical for early sound, that just makes the lulls seem more pronounced. \n\nThe story opens at a convent in Spain as a group of postulates prepare to take their vows and become actual nuns. Maria Vargas (Dorothy Jordon) gets a visit from her soldier brother Enrique (Russell Hopton). From their conversation it is clear that Maria is here because her entire family wants a nun in the family, not because of any independent will on Maria's part. As a result of a weird and possibly unfortunate choice of zoning, Maria hears Juan de Dios (Ramon Navarro) singing at the cabaret next door. (What is a cabaret doing next to a convent???) Maria climbs up to the top of the convent wall, sees Juan and it is love at first sight. This is most unfortunate for her, since Juan de Dios seems to love nothing but trouble. Maria, who has not yet taken her vows, runs away from the convent in search of him.\n\nJuan callously casts girls aside, steals from local vendors for the thrill of it all, and then runs across Maria staring at him adoringly as he evades the police for the latest chaos he has caused at the market. He takes the girl in and takes advantage of the fact that she obviously adores him to have her cook for him, clean for him, and take extraordinary criticism from him anytime he wants to feel better about himself - however relations between them are squeaky clean thus belying the film's title. In what seems like a bit of miscasting, Ernest Torrence, a big craggy mountain of a man who looks like he should be playing a pirate sailing the seven seas, instead plays Juan's mentor and voice instructor. Why he puts up with this selfish kid's abuse and insubordination is beyond me. \n\nThere is a reason for making Navarro's character so unlikable though. At his audition for the opera in Madrid, Juan's mentor is told that Juan will never be a great singer because his heart has not been broken - there s no there there in short. Since Juan seems to have no heart that could possibly ever be broken it seems like his soul and his singing have hit a dead end. What can turn all of this around? Watch and find out.\n\nDorothy Jordan starred opposite Navarro in the first three of his sound films - this was their third appearance together. Navarro had been an effective romantic lead in the silent era, but the coming of sound both blessed him and cursed him. It blessed him by allowing MGM to showcase his marvelous tenor voice. Sound cursed him because the pitch of his speaking voice projected sweetness rather than masculinity. This would explain Jordan as a frequent costar. Yes, she was a talented singer whose voice meshed well with his, but she was also capable of being femininely unintimidating which made Navarro's lack of machismo in sound films less stark. For example, in this film she is almost mimicking Minnie Mouse in her diminutive portrayal of Maria. Once more powerful female sound stars begin to take the field such as Barbara Stanwyck and Jean Harlow, there was just no way Navarro could hope to hold on to the leading roles he had once had, especially after musicals went out of fashion for a couple of years starting at the end of 1930. \n\nI'd recommend this one because it is put together pretty well although it does have that characteristic of MGM films of the time - an abrupt right turn in the plot that causes an outlandish happy ending for all concerned.",

CALL OF THE FLESH is a\ncase in point. Good production values & fine performances can not save this film from its one fatal flaw: it is difficult to like, or even tolerate, the hero.\n\nRamon Novarro, usually quite the pleasant fellow, here is forced to play a repellent rogue who quickly irritates the audience with his cruel treatment of those who love him most. Oozing a smarmy charm, he alternately smirks & pouts his way through the plot, until his eventual - and much belated -\nregeneration. Novarro's undoubted acting abilities enable him to deliver a fine performance, but mischievousness mixed with too much meanness can result in viewer apathy.\n\nThis did not help his career. The fad for the Latin Lover was wearing mighty thin already and would soon be completely eclipsed by the All American Hero, and Novarro's sexual ambiguity was always a bit of a problem for the MGM front office. The advent of Sound, while finally revealing his strong singing voice, also exhibited his Mexican accent, making it difficult to cast him in traditional roles. The Studio simply couldn't come up with a definitive screen persona for him, and so Novarro was made into their ethnic chameleon, playing everything from Chinese to Arab to Navajo.\n\nNovarro's costars come through very well. Dorothy Jordan is radiant as the innocent young woman who loves him with every fiber of her being; she delivers a heart touching, memorable performance. Flamboyant & hammy, Scottish actor Ernest Torrence is terrific as Novarro's friend & mentor -\nalthough one has to wonder just why he was willing to put up with so much nonsense from the little squirt. Equally adept at drama or comedy, Torrence's theatrical mannerisms and the contortions of his great homely face make him both entertaining to the audience and an enjoyable contrast to handsome Novarro. French actress Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e, in her final film, stirs up the flames in her role as Novarro's musical partner & lover. (Ill health would bring about the early deaths of both Torrence & Ador\u00e9e in 1933 - he at 54 and she at 35. Today, these two fine performers are virtually forgotten.)\n\nMention should be made of Mathilde Comont, hilarious as a\nrotund little diva turned landlady.\n\nNovarro is in good voice throughout, which is fortunate as the plot keeps him singing interminably.",

                "text": "I must disagree with several of the reviews here by our members. Not because I think this is a great film -- it's not. But because they seem a bit unaware of the situation.\n\nFirst, in terms of why the popularity of his films fell off. This film was a healthy money-maker, and so were several of his films after this. But, particularly in the early days of Hollywood, the film industry tended to go through cycles of \"taste\". Some of the cycles were stories about rich people all taking place during the Depression, stories about jewel thieves, stories that took place in exotic lands, etc. And one cycle was \"Latin lovers\"...a cycle which lasted about a decade, beginning with Valentino and practically ending with Novarro. And why did that cycle end? The coming of the American hero -- Gable and Cagney in 1931, just one year after this film. American tastes were changing.\n\nSecond, rather than blame Novarro for the problems with this film, I choose to blame the director. Slow pace -- that's the director's responsibility. Meandering script -- how is that the actor's fault? Poor sound -- after all, the film was made just 3 years into the talkies and the big improvements that arrived right around this time. This looks like a fairly big budget film for MGM...consider the sets, for example.\n\nI found the criticisms of Novarro's acting interesting. It certainly doesn't fit today's tastes (nor does his singing voice...a style that was totally outdated by a decade later when the crooners took over. What did I see in Novarro's acting? He appears pleasant on screen here; a good person. But I saw gay mannerisms by an actor trying to be suave and manly. And that's why I think his acting here doesn't quite work.\n\nI know what you may be thinking. This review is just written by a Novarro fan. Nope. First movie of his that I ever saw. But what is missing in many of the reviews here is context. And the context is a threshold of change in Hollywood -- change in what is desired in a leading man, change is the type of stories to be told, change in the technical abilities of the Hollywood studios, change in the tastes of the American public.\n\nThis is worth watching for a glimpse of really old Hollywood on the verge of morphing into the Gables and Loys and Cagneys and Davises.",

After seeing this effort, it's remarkably easy to understand why Novarro's stellar career declined so rapidly and dramatically in the sound era. It's not that there's anything wrong with his voice, it's just that his acting seems so ludicrously inept and his personality so colorless and lacking in charisma. Mind you, if you turn off the sound, then Novarro's gestures and even his persona appear quite acceptable. But with sound in this film, he's just ridiculous! True, the script itself is a load of old romantic melodrama that's about impossible to stomach, let alone get involved in. The only way to rescue this sort of operettish stew from the throw-out pot, is to pep it up with flair and imagination. Unfortunately, Charles Brabin is not this sort of chef \u0096 at least not here. He did learn his lesson, but here his direction is little more than disinterested and/or routine. Even the sets lack the pictorial qualities we usually associate with Cedric Gibbons. The sound recording of course is poor.

And there, on TCM, we found \"With Byrd at the South Pole. Byrd stood nervously before the camera, stiffly, nervously trying to communicate the scope and dangers of his mission. The nervousness was in stark contrast to his absolute sure-handed, calm planning and control in the most trying circumstances.\n\nWe marveled at the thoroughness and foresight of his planning, his concern for the safety of his crew--no one died on the mission, despite blizzards, crevasses, 4 straight months of no sunlight,and icy , treacherous footing, with temperatures reaching -72 F.\n\nMost outstanding was the Oscar-winning cinematography, unself-consciously artistic and breathtaking. We often wonder, watching adventure films, how cameramen somehow manage to be on a mountain peak before the climbers, wrestling heavy, awkward burdens of cameras, film and tripods. In this documentary, the visual thrills are endless and revelatory.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the film is the quiet dignity, humanity and willing work of the 42 trekkers. There is no evidence of complaining,a quiet competency and absolute dedication to hard work.There is a moving episode as a lead dog, overcomes illness and infirmity in a heartbreaking attempt to stay with the sled dog teams.\n\nThis film is less \"dramatic\" than Flaherty's epics, but totally involving in terms of our emotional involvement.Find this film gem if you can...it's unforgettable.",

If you want to know what it was like to be one of the first people to explore the bottom of the world this is for you. To be certain others were there first Roald Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton were all there first, but Byrd was still there when there were no permanent facilities and a trip to the ice was a years long adventure. This is amazing stuff (even if some of it seems staged). If there is any real flaw its that the flight to the Pole is almost anti-climatic when compared with just trying to survive.\n\nIt should noted that the film is mostly silent. Sound film was really just taking off when the expedition was taking off, and even so the sound equipment would never have passed the weight restrictions. What sound there is comes from an introduction by Byrd, sound effects, and some narration during the actual flight.\n\nRecommended.

The documentary covers the year-long journey of Rear Admiral Richard Byrd as he tracks down to the South Pole where he attempts to become the first person to fly over it. The documentary picks up as the ship leaves New York and we pretty much see their not so good life for the next year as they struggle to build up their shelters as well as having to deal with the low temperatures and of course actually building the plane to try and make it fly. I think history buffs are certainly going to get a kick out of seeing this footage as there's no question that it's pretty remarkable getting to see this historic event. The cinematography really puts you right there as there are some terrific shots of the wildlife and some footage showing how dangerous everything is. Just take a look at some of the shots during the two blizzards that are shown and you're really amazed that no one was killed. There's also quite a bit of humor added in the title cards (the film is silent) in regards to the low temperatures and there's a funny sequence where we see some spring cleaning and we get to see how they get a hot bath. The Aeriel footage is another major plus. The film starts off with a talking sequence with Byrd delivering a speech about his journey. This is probably the worst sequence because of how badly he struggles to read the cue cards. His eyes are constantly looking over to the cards and even worse is how he has to break sentences up to look over and see where to pick up again. Still, the actual images is what makes this film so special and worth viewing.",

Yet it becomes very believable because of the acting of the two with each other. They both help each other out in this movie to make their performances work out as both good and hilarious.\n\nThe movie features some really great and funny sequences, such as Oliver going done a staircase on a roller-skate and Laurel & Hardy being washed away by a large flood wave. The movie has some truly unique and hilarious comical moments in it that makes \"Brats\" an original as well as an hilarious comedy short.

This isn't to say the film isn't funny, but the reason most will enjoy it has more to do with the odd plot and cool sets.\n\nStan and Ollie play dual roles--as themselves and as their young sons! And to do this, some amazing sets needed to be constructed. Identical rooms and props needed to be made--one in normal size and the other about triple normal size to make them look like little kids (probably about four or five years-old). And the film seamlessly switches back and forth! You've just got to admire all the work and final product here.\n\nAs far as the humor goes, the film is a bit thinner than the usual film for the duo. While there are gags, most of the time it just consists of the child versions slapping each other around, though occasionally the adult Stan and particular Ollie, get their lumps as well. The very end of the movie is a terrific gag where adult Ollie gets his! Overall, this is a very unique and watchable film that most should enjoy. While not my favorite short, it is still well worth seeing and packs a lot of entertainment.\n\nPS--a continuity problem exists in the film. Stan turns on the water to the tub and the tub seems to fill itself in just a few seconds AND the water turns itself off! While hardly a major mistake, it is rather striking.",

However, not having enough trouble simply trying to enjoy their games of draughts and pool, the two children are just as much of a handful as their dads.\n\nAs with many of their best shorts, the plot here is simple and allows for several extended sequences around the same theme.  Here we have several good sequences \u0096 none of which would make the short it itself but together they work.  The gimmick (for that is what it is) of Laurel and Hardy also playing their sons works quite well \u0096 although in the scenes where the adults and children are separate it doesn't really matter who is who as it's very much a case of `like father like son'.\n\nThe sequences are nothing you haven't seen before but the delivery of them is good and the short doesn't really dip more than once.  That `once' is where Hardy sings.  I enjoy his voice and always liked the features where he got more of a chance to sing a proper song, however here it goes on for a little longer than it should.  The punch line is good but I really had hoped for more.  Because it had been built up for about 3 minutes before it actually arrives I had been pumped up and then was a bit deflated by the actual delivery \u0096 but this was a minor flaw as I found the majority to be of their usual standard.\n\nAs adults or kids Laurel and Hardy are great.  In all honesty there is no significant difference between their delivery as kids or adults but this doesn't matter.  This is a fine example of their abilities as the two of them are the only people in the film \u0096 they carry the film and hold 100% of screen time.  I know this must sound easy in a 20 minutes short but I feel that it only appears easy because they make it all look so effortless.\n\nOverall this may be a little gimmicky but it works very well.  I am probably a little jaded seeing adults playing kids etc in one form or another in recent movies but here the film moves past the gimmick and delivers classic Laurel and Hardy \u0096 just in two separate strands which come together in a flood of chuckles by the end.",

It is funny, though as the boys are playing 'themselves' as their children. With grown-up Stan still being dumb, but his 'son', Stanley looking smarter, outsmarting 'little Oliver'. This is where the distinction in names lies, the little ones taking on their full first names, as if they are naughty - how many times did parents mention your full names when chastising you! The props had to be built up for the 'child scenes' in the correct scale, sometimes it wasn't achieved, but this was the 1930's and it was about 30 mins long. The grown ups are playing games, checkers, pool etc, where Stan is giving Ollie a bad time, destroying his furniture, bashing Ollie's nut, (As usual!) with interruptions from the kids fighting, having their dads rush up to sort it out.\n\nOne of my favourite 'special effects moments' of all time is where Ollie trips on one of the kids' rollerskates, and falls down the stairs - well, he bumps his butt down the stairs, and his 'legs' are splayed out as he does this. But check this stunt out. You can clearly see it's speeded up, and the so called 'legs' are dummy ones being held out! It's an absolutely absurd but laughable stunt that had me in stitches for the way it was done, and not the actual slapstick it purports to be! It's worth checking out the short for this reason alone! As it goes on, the kids in their antics have filled their en-suite bathroom with water (That's the bathroom, not just the bath - very watertight door holds this water back for the finale!). Oblivious to this, the grown ups have come upstairs to check out the noise, the kids ask if Ollie will sing to them to get them off to sleep. The kids ask for a glass of water when this doesn't go to plan. As Stan goes to get the water, Ollie, hauls him back by his tail, stating: \"Just a moment, you might spill it!\" leaving Ollie to 'spill it' as he opens the bathroom door in spectacular 'niagara falls' style! It ends here, and as I've said it's a must to check out the stunt of Ollie going down the stairs! It has to be seen to be believed!",

Focusing on Laurel and Hardy looking after their young children, making sure they do not wreak havoc on the house while their wives are away, the short has Laurel and Hardy playing their younger selves, scaled down in size thanks to an entirely modified, recreated set with larger furniture. It's obvious that Laurel and Hardy were simply shrunk down to look the part in terms of physical size, but it's undoubtedly the harder, costlier way to go about this process rather than hiring two child actors to play the performers' children.\n\nWith this, Brats utilizes Laurel and Hardy's children quite vividly and frequently, not making them momentary, cameo characters, but centering the entire short around them. We see director James Parrott and writers Leo McCarey and H.M. Walker explore the possibilities of having these characters function as children, interacting with their elders and embracing their own level of mischief akin to their parents. The illusion of Laurel and Hardy being child-size comes from modifications in the set design, where oversized furniture, staircases, and rooms were constructed to give Laurel and Hardy the appearance of being small when surrounded by much bigger items. This effect is ingenuous, especially for the time period, and the fact that an easy, albeit less believable, way could've been done for a fraction of the price just shows the dedication of the film crew at hand.\n\nBrats is a lot of fun, heavy on slapstick, but pleasantly so, as we have an original, innovative idea at hand and a nice focus on Laurel and Hardy rather than a bunch of occasionally distracting side characters. The short furthers my opinion that radicalism in film has always been present in a sense of finding out what you can do with the medium and pushing that boundary a bit further, and to see it exercised in a genre that didn't need or call for any enormous technical or production modifications whatsoever shows the power and ambition of those who work on a film.\n\nStarring: Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Directed by: James Parrott.",

Bancroft plays one of the sailors, Bill Rafferty, and William \"Stage\" Boyd plays his adversary, Jed Graves. Boyd's part looks like something that in the silent era would have gone to Clive Brooks, but Brooks' aristocratic British voice would simply not have gone with the part.\n\nThe feud between the two sailors escalates when Rafferty gets promoted to captain over Graves because Graves has brought a woman on board before and the shipping company is afraid Graves might do it again. The great irony here - Rafferty has just stolen Graves' date during shore leave, accidentally fell in love with her, and invited her to stow away on board the next morning, all happening BEFORE he gets the promotion. Complications ensue.\n\nThere are some very realistic scenes here of ships at sea cast adrift on the waves of a bad storm. It has quite fluid motion for an early talkie.

It's also something even more valuable - a talking picture featuring the attitudes and all the excesses of the roaring 20's just months before the stock market crash. Technically, it would have been impossible to make such a film just a year before. A year later, a film such as this one - a comedy about lying stockbrokers - would have seemed ridiculous and likely angered the suffering depression era audiences, and thus it would not have been made in the first place.\n\nRichard Dix stars as stock broker Robert Bennett working in a brokerage firm where the boss, E. M. Burke, postulates that lying is a necessary part of their business. He has to lie to sell stocks, he says, as long as he believes in the long run the stock is a good investment he believes it's OK. Dix says that one should always tell the truth. Since Bennett is given to some lying himself ,the other brokers in the office and the boss bet 10,000 dollars against Bennett's 10,000 dollars that Bennett cannot tell the absolute truth for 24 hours. What the boss and the other brokers don't know is that Burke's daughter and Bob's fianc\u00e9e Gwen has visited Bob just minutes before and said that she has raised 10,000 dollars for charity and needs to double it in five days because if she does her father has said he will match it - this is the 10K that Bob is betting. Apparently a total of 40K is needed for what her charitable group is trying to accomplish. Realize in 1929 40K is roughly equivalent to half a million dollars in 2010. So, without knowing it, Mr. Burke has much more on the line than ten thousand dollars.\n\nWhat follows is a briskly paced comedy as the brokers and the boss won't let Bennett out of their sight until 4PM the next day when the bet expires, waiting for him to tell that one bet-ending lie. Side plots include two gold-digging chorus girls who meet Burke and the brokers in a speak-easy that night and are determined to hold Burke to his promise to finance their idea for a show. They're not taking no for an answer. They seem to hold all the cards as they have managed to enter Burke's home and refuse to leave without the cash. Burke could refuse them and have them thrown out, but then he'd have to explain to his wife how he knew these two buxom chorines and what they were doing in their home. Meanwhile, as a guest in his future in-laws' home, Bob is faced with the torment of listening to the terrible singing of a female guest whose choice of haberdashery looks like a milk pail with a bow on it. Of course he's asked to give his opinion on both her hat and her singing.\n\nI'd recommend this one to anybody who likes a good comedy. You don't even have to be a precode or early talkie fan to enjoy this one. A tolerance for a modest dose of Helen Kane (she plays one of the gold-digging chorus girls) is really all that's required.

Richard Dix plays Bob a stockbroker who is very carefree with other people's money.

His fianc\u00e9e comes to him with $10,000 from her charity group to invest - she wants him to double it in 5 days - \"you can't go wrong in the stock market\" she says. The world would find out by the year's end how wrong that was.\n\nMeanwhile a couple of his friends bet him $10,000 that he cannot tell the truth for 24 hours. he gleefully accepts, thinking how easy it will be.\n\nThey go to a nightclub where they are entertained by a sister act - Mabel and Sabel. Helen Kane sings \"Do Something\" - her sister is played by Wynne Gibson, who had a pretty good career playing hard boiled dames, like the one she plays in this movie.\n\nThey are two gold-diggers on the look out for a sugar daddy (Burton Churchill) an old wealthy business man to back their show.

Because of this, there were no guidelines on how to make such pictures--just a lot of trial and error. For example, in most early sound pictures, the accompanying sound was NOT inserted into the strip of film which soon became the standard. And, adding music to films literally meant having a band immediately off-camera doing the music live! Another standard practice that they had to work out was making films too talking. After years of making silent films, too often studios had folks talk and talk and talk-- with very little action. Why? Well it wasn't only making up for lost time but because microphones needed to be VERY close to actors...and many times they stood practically still because of this. As a result, most films made during this era are pretty terrible when you see them today...and most were remade a lot better only a few years later. This is DEFINITELY true of \"Nothing But the Truth\"--a decent idea for a film but one that is severely hindered by primitive sound movie techniques. Folks talk way too much, the action a bit stilted AND Helen Kane's routine grew VERY tiresome very quickly. She was the inspiration for Betty Boop...which is fine in an 8 minute cartoon...but imagine a woman talking just like this character throughout a live-action movie! Now this in not saying the film is all bad. Star Richard Dix is more natural on camera than the other actors in the film...and it is very easy to understand how he was a big star in the early 1930s.\n\nAs to the movie, as I said above, it is very dated and doesn't work very well today. The story, while a bit hard to believe, is enjoyable and the film still worth seeing provided you are able to see it in context and cut it some slack! After all, the idea of a man making a bet he could ONLY tell the truth for 24 hours and how difficult this could be might make for a good film. Here, despite many problems, it's still a cute idea.",

The most realistic performance is handed out by Louis John Bartels. As for the direction by Victor Schertzinger, you might well ask, \"What direction?\" It shows a complete absence of style, polish or sophistication. My question is: \"Why hire Schertzinger? The janitor could have done as good a job!\" The producer's aim was obviously to save money. The budget is ridiculously small. The film was shot entirely within the studio on no more than five or six sets and for the most part, the movie is put across in extremely long takes which are occasionally broken up by inserted close-ups. Admittedly, there is a small amount of camera movement \u0096 evidently achieved by putting the sound recording booth on wheels \u0096 but the booth's restrictions on movement are still very evident and the grainy, diffused lighting is a dead giveaway.

The wolf believes the story, not knowing about the broke fianc\u00e9, and gets revenge by ruining himself and thus his partner in the process by making unwise trades. He then walks away from the marriage leaving both his partner and wife broke, which was about the worst thing that could happen to you at the end of the roaring 20s.\n\nNewspapers panned its lack of originality. Knowing the players I can get an idea how this must have worked. Bancroft usually played the \"he-man\" type, and was already a big silent star at Paramount. He had a slow deliberate way of speaking, and stayed on top at Paramount until his own ego did him in. If Bancroft had portrayed Popeye in 1930, he would have played it like he was Bluto. This was his first talking picture. Nancy Carroll often played the pert smart mouth, earning the reputation of a redhead in both her parts and her problems with management. I don't know if what she told the wolf about his wife was true, but I can see her playing the scene with gusto, true or false.\n\nNow we come to the most ponderous part. Olga Baclanova could barely speak English when the talkies came in, but she was such a big star, playing the parts of evil seductresses, Paramount gave her a try. This was her first talking picture too, and I can only judge it by the one that came after it - \"A Dangerous Woman\", made also in 1929. I could barely understand a word she said in that one. The idea of her and Lukas carrying on any passionate scene in which they had to speak to one another can only make me smile in a \"Singin in the Rain\" kind of way as Lukas also had a very heavy accent when he first started out in film, having migrated from Hungary as an adult. I base this on some of the very early talkies that I have seen him in. Again, this is his first talking picture performance. Lukas, however, improved greatly in a short period of time, and although the accent always remained, his speech was quite clear in a matter of a few years.\n\nIf you want to see a movie made before the crash about stock brokers and how they lived made by the same studio - Paramount - try to find a copy of 1929's \"Nothing But the Truth\" starring Richard Dix. It gives you a good idea of the amounts of money that the rich threw around and the risks that stock brokers seemed to love to take in that pre crash era.",

A&A are the very SYMBOL of Hollywood racism, defaming the image of blacks.  Supposedly.\n\nI would take it that \"Amos and Andy\" represents (however accurately or not) a broadly caricatured representation of regular poor black folks.  You could make it out to depict them as foolish, but no more so I say than do shows aimed at poor whites.  I have in mind for starters the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nNor  are the depictions of Amos and Andy harsher than those of Ma and Pa Kettle.  Now THERE is some negative stereotyping.\n\nBut hey!  It's just a joke, and not particularly mean.  Amos and Andy as characters aren't deep, but they're affectionate and good natured, just a couple of regular joes trying to get by.  Doesn't strike me as much of a hate crime.\n\nOh, and they're pretty damned funny, too.  Note that this bears the same screenwriter's name as several Marx brothers classics, Bert Kalmar.  This ain't quite up there with \"Duck Soup,\" but it's pretty funny stuff.  The kingfish and the lodge stuff put me in mind of the Flintstones' \"Water Buffalo\" lodge, and the silly rituals and blowhard leaders trying to puff themselves up to look like alpha-males.\n\nAlso, this film stops for some straight up film time for the most righteous Duke Ellington orchestra.  There is very limited film available for any musicians of the era, especially black ones.  This part alone justifies the film's existence for me.\n\nC'mon, loosen up folks.  Eddie Murphy makes 10 times more stinging jokes. At least Amos and Andy weren't pimps or dope-dealers or crooks.",

                "text": "It always amazes me to hear all the negative comments about \"Amos and Andy,\" especially concerning their 50's TV series. They may not be the brightest bulbs in the bunch, but they have jobs, they care for others, and are law-abiding guys. In the TV show, other blacks were even portrayed as businessmen, doctors, and lawyers. Where does all that insult blacks? Because they mispronounce some words? Please.\n\nNow of course, in \"Check and Double Check\" Amos and Andy are played by two guys in blackface, the two white guys who have made Amos and Andy famous up until that point. It is very funny seeing the white guys in blackface, because there is no doubting they are indeed white men (Kingfish is white too). Seeing this film was especially interesting for me because I have the two Amos and Andy cartoons from 1934 (the only ones ever made) which use the voices of these two actors.\n\nThe movie itself is pretty good, Amos and Andy get mixed up in some society plot, involving some well-to-do white people from Westchester. Back in Harlem, the duo run their taxicab company, and there are some nice shots of New York City in 1930. And for train/subway fans, there is a particular treat, as we go into the original Pennsylvania Station for some shots! There are some funny scenes in the film, with Andy's deadpan lines making me laugh the most. Maybe the thing that would surprise most new viewers of this film, is just how much the actors underplay their roles as Amos and Andy as far as black stereotyping from the 30's goes. As all old film fans know, black actors in these old movies were usually put in for comic relief, making funny faces and noises, looking bug-eyed, running scared at the slightest sound, jumping around with arms flailing if they were scared, etc. But these two guys really don't do any of that. Sure, they play for comedy, but even though they are in blackface, they actually avoid all that kind of stuff, and just play the comedy straight. This may disappoint anyone looking to blast and tear the film apart concerning the two actors as Amos and Andy, but it's the truth, they really don't make an effort to make blacks look silly, they are really playing a comedy while happening to be in blackface.\n\nMost don't understand just how huge the characters of Amos and Andy were in those days. This film is an unbelievable artifact of the era, an entertaining excursion into 1930's comedy. The quality of the print is also downright excellent on the DVD I viewed. I highly recommend this film for entertainment as well as historical study.",

                "text": "Different individuals are going to have different interpretations of Amos and Andy. I prefer to look at them as individualistic characters and not simply as racial stereotypes. I find Amos Jones especially compelling. I've listened to the surviving radio episodes (it's so sad that so many of the early one's are missing, but check out the excellent work of Elizabeth McLeod for insight into the early days of the program), I've watched the television series (the first sitcom to feature an all African-Amrerican cast), and now I've seen the 1930 film Check And Double Check. I prefer the radio and TV series, but there are moments in Check And Double that really tickle my funny bone and tug my heartstrings. \n\nSome may see Amos' feelings for Mr. Williams as a racist stereotype, but I don't personally interpret that scene in that way. I know that Amos' father Elijah spent a great deal of time away looking for work and he died in a mining accident. I also know that Amos' mother Sarah died of overwork. It's therefore very moving for me to witness Amos' grief in Check and Double Check for yet another a parental figure who has passed away. Gosden is extremely effective in that scene. It's heartbreaking. I also admire Amos' altruism and actually cheered for him as he strove to save the day in the movie. Amos Jones has heart and soul. He's an underdog hero to me.\n\nAmos and Andy are often comedic, but they are far more complex than just simplistic stereotypes. That's one of the reasons why they remain so controversial. It is also why they remain so beloved by fans of various races. Fans who watch Check And Double Check as just one small part of a much larger character study may appreciate the movie the most. Check And Double Check doesn't have the same magic that the radio and TV series had (Hollywood added too many unnecessary moments with original characters not based on the Amos and Andy program) but the film does offer a glimpse at the early days before the altruistic Amos matured into a far more comfortable city dweller, a more successful business man, a devoted husband, and a loving father. It took time for Amos to get used to life in the big city, but he always had a heart of gold and I greatly admire him. \n\nThe Christmas episodes of the Amos and Andy radio and TV series are my favorites. Give them a look or a listen. Childress and Gosden were both wonderful as Amos. Those who are interested should definitely watch the documentary Amos And Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy. Look up Elizabeth McLeod on the internet too. Her research into Amos and Andy is educational and extremely impressive. I recently read that there is an off-Broadway play entitled \"Kingfish, Amos, and Andy\" too. Can't wait to see it!",

                "text": "There are those who like Amos & Andy and those who don't. The controversy has been expertly chronicled in African-American director George Kirby's fine documentary Amos & Andy: Anatomy of A Controversy. That film also captures the deep affection that fans of all races have for Amos & Andy. These characters continue to be important and beloved. Recently a play about Amos & Andy was performed at the Black Forum in New York. The revolutionary Amos & Andy radio program, which featured a racially diverse cast which included the wonderful Ernestine Wade, is still listened to all these many decades later. The Amos & Andy TV program is also still fondly remembered by people of all races. Amos & Andy continue to endure and there would be no Amos & Andy without the artists who started it all: Correll and Gosden. These two men were masters at creating characters on radio that many people could connect with. Check and Double Check isn't the best vehicle for Correll and Gosden's beloved characters, but I can understand why many Amos & Andy fans appreciate Check and Double Check.\n\nThere are many ways to interpret a film. Check and Double Check is no exception. Some detractors claim the haunted house humor is an example of racism. Other viewers see it as a spooky comedy routine like that of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, or Don Knotts. Some detractors claim that Amos's comments about a lost loved one are pro-Jim Crow. Other viewers see the same scenes as Amos as being sentimental for a lost loved one. Some critics cite Amos & Andy's behavior towards a white police officer as a negative example. Other viewers see Amos & Andy's behavior as a survival technique often employed by individuals of various minority groups in the past to protect themselves against further potential negativity from intolerant abusers. When analyzing this film it's important to keep in mind that it was inspired by a radio program that was revolutionary for it's time. It featured black characters in both comedic and dramatic situations. The audience, both black and white, could identify and care about Amos & Andy. They were kept on the edge of their seats because they cared about what would happen next to these characters. Amos & Andy went on to make radio history by featuring a racially mixed cast of extremely talented individuals like the wonderful Ernestine Wade. Then Amos & Andy made television history by becoming the very first situation comedy on American television with an all African-American cast. These are important and very beloved characters.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said, \"There are three things I'll never forget about America - Niagra Falls, the Rocky Mountains and Amos 'n Andy.\" To learn more about the history of Amos and Andy I strongly recommend watching George Kirby's documentary Amos & Andy: Anatomy of A Controversy. I also strongly recommend Elizabeth McLeod's book about the original Amos & Andy. Henry Louis Gates wrote in his memoir Colored People \"Everybody loved 'Amos and Andy'. The day they took 'Amos and Andy' off the air was one of the saddest days in Piedmont. As far as we were concerned the foibles of Kingfish or Calhoun were the foibles of individuals who happened to be funny.\" That's the same way that many Amos & Andy fans perceive Check and Double Check. I'm fortunate to be able to share my love for Amos & Andy with a racially diverse group of fans on a daily basis. Racism has nothing to do with why we love Amos & Andy.",

                "text": "Well, I just picked up an original film print of CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK and have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. After many years of reading one abysmal review after another, I found the film to be a fairly impressive RKO comedy. But I also think this film can only be viewed in the context of its time of release. And not for racial stereotype reasons. First, the film obviously came about by the strong popularity of the AMOS 'N ANDY radio program. However, comparison cannot be made between the film and the program as we know it because the program only began a year before this film was made (Amos 'n Andy had, in fact, had recently been known as Sam 'n Henry). So the smooth, well-oiled manner of the 40's heyday was still many years to come. Structure-wise, CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK somewhat resembles RKO's popular Wheeler and Woolsey films and features the two comics in traditional musical-comedy leading/though supporting roles. The story plot is very typical of shows of the day - DIXIANA, COCOANUTS, etc (Ralf Harolde repeats his villainous visage from DIXIANA). The picture is very well photographed from the standpoint of RKO's current production values and it is very well recorded. One interesting note - one that can only be gleaned from having an actual film print - is that the picture was released in nine reels. Given that the running time is 77 minutes, it is probable that there was some trimming done after the previews. An interesting note about the music in the film. Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Orchestra are the featured performers. At one point in the film there is a very bluesy, Harlemesque introduction to a number. But the film then cuts to a shot of the band playing \"Three Little Words\" in standard foxtrot tempo. Upon this number's conclusion, the band goes into a blues number. We then go outside to the garden where a scene between the romantic leads is played and the band is again heard in the distance playing \"Three Litte Words\". The duo even comment on the song and its meaning. It is apparent there was some moving around of sequences taking place here. And it's possible there was additional music recorded that did not make it into the final release print. As for Amos 'n Andy, there is a nice mix of verbal and visual set-pieces. There is also one surprisingly effective scene where Amos 'n Andy are told that their former employer/benefactor has died and Andy makes a very sorrowful speech about his goodness. It's one of the most genuinely emotional monologues I can recall from any RKO film of that very early talkie period. The one semi-drawback to the film is that Freeman Gosden (Andy) is not able to play Kingfish as he did on radio. In CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK, Kingfish is played by Russ Powell (in blackface - as are many others in the cast including at least one band member and stuttering comic Roscoe Ates). Film fans will remember Powell as the dockman at the beginning of KING KONG (\"You going' on that crazy voyage?!\"). Powell doesn't have quite the delightful devil about him that Gosden did in his portrayal of Kingfish on the radio - or Tim Moore on television. Had CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK been made six or seven years later, it might have had more polish and pacing. But even by the mid-thirties it is unlikely that a blacked-up Amos 'N Andy would have been welcomed in the cinemas. So we have only this one feature as a pictorialization of the proprietors of the Fresh Air Taxi Cab Corporation. If you can put yourself back into a 1930 frame of reference, give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.",

The TV show is fondly remembered by tens of thousands who were lucky enough to see it. The reason for this is simple; they made people laugh. This movie, however, is a very poor example of the character's work.\n\nThe main thrust of the plot is an uninteresting love triangle between a wealthy heiress, her jerk of a rich boyfriend and an old flame who has lost his wealth and is seeking to reclaim it. Although the movie is a comedy, none of these three characters are in any way funny. Amos n' Andy are secondary characters in the story. This is the first blow to the story. Amos, Andy and the Kingfish carried their own stories for years, why should they play second fiddle to people we care nothing about? To make it worse, Amos n' Andy's involvement in the plot is painfully contrived. The plots of the radio and TV shows were smooth and sensible (for a comedy). They worked because they did not have to be forced. The plot of this movie, by contrast, seemed forced every step of the way.\n\nCopies of the Amos n' Andy radio and TV shows are available for sale.

I can show examples of that in a whole lot of films without a black face in them. I do remember as a kid seeing the television version of Amos and Andy and later on watching such shows as Sanford and Son and Good Times, I'd be hard pressed to see the difference in the humor.\n\nBut you have to see Check and Doublecheck and realize that it was a pair of white ex-vaudevillians who were playing these characters. And playing them servile. Note right at the beginning of the film as the Fresh Air Taxi was holding up traffic and a cop asks them to move along. Note the tone he takes with them and note the \"yassuh\" response that both of them give. Later on Amos and Andy are busy reminiscing about the good old days on the plantation back in Georgia before they came to Harlem. Back in Georgia dealing with Klan and lucky to be making enough money to exist on as sharecroppers. Of course you know they're going to help the son of the old plantation owner. \n\nThe plot as it is Check and Doublecheck has the son of that former plantation owner previously described looking for the deed to an old abandoned house in Harlem so he can claim title, sell it, and be rich enough to marry his intended. His path crossed that of Amos and Andy who are on a kind of treasure hunt for their Mystic Knights of the Sea Lodge. The intended bride is played by Sue Carol who left acting to become an agent and her most famous client was her fourth and last husband Alan Ladd.\n\nAlso in the film are Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. Ellington made his screen debut here and he played himself in several films after this. For that reason this film should be seen, to hear one of the great jazz bands of the last century.\n\nThe premise they bring Ellington in is in itself ridiculous. Remember this film is made in 1930 and while Ellington played at Harlem's Cotton Club he didn't get too many bookings at Westchester society parties. But that's what this film would have you believe. That crowd would have more likely hired Leo Reisman or Ray Noble. And of course the band gets there via The Fresh Air Taxi Company.\n\nSinging with the band are The Rhythm Boys, recently detached from Paul Whiteman's Orchestra which included their lead singer Bing Crosby. According to Gary Giddins recent biography of Crosby, Ellington was dissatisfied with the vocal group he had and had RKO hire the Rhythm Boys to sing offstage while three black performers lipsynched. That is one ironic twist of fate. Later on Bing and his partners, Al Rinker and Harry Barris recorded their song from this film Three Little Words with Duke Ellington's orchestra which was a mega hit back in the day. \n\nEven with a hit song coming from this film, Check and Doublecheck created no big demand for Amos and Andy films. Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll stayed on radio for another 25 years with their characters. Maybe just as well they only made one more film appearance in the all star Big Broadcast of 1936.",

Also, the characters get treated with respect by other, more sophisticated characters within the stories in both the TV and film versions.

Fox saw her as their own \"It\" girl and she was featured as a flapper in picture after picture - too many, because there came a time when Dixie Lee, who was always \"the friend\", suddenly started getting a big build up (and deservedly so). That was in 1929. In 1930 Sue was the ingenue in RKO's \"Check and Double Check\", a movie that became one of the biggest money makers of the year - all because of Amos and Andy. They were top radio stars played by white actors, Freeman F. Godsen and Charles J. Correll, in black face. The publicity for the film was enormous, coinciding with an Amos and Andy candy bar, which went a long way toward the films popularity - not for any artistic merit. RKO thought it had made a great deal when it signed the comics who turned down offers from Warners and Paramount, to take $250,000 plus 50% of the net profits but the comics were difficult. They wouldn't be photographed without their makeup and refused to give interviews about their personal lives. Fortunately there was no second movie, the audiences had turned up just for the novelty value of seeing their radio favourites in the flesh.\n\nAmos (Godsen) and Andy (Correll) are the proud owners of the Fresh Air Taxi Cab Company of America. Andy is the brains of the pair (he thinks) and really likes to put Amos down. Kingfish (Russ Powell) has a big job for the boys - he wants them to take Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Orchestra to a party and be back in time for their lodge meeting of the Mystic Knights of the Sea. The band is over two hours late to play at the birthday party of Jean (Sue Carol) who is due to announce her engagement to Richard (Charles Morton). He, in turn, is eager to search his grandfather's vacant house in Harlem for a deed that will make his fortune. Overhearing the conversation is the villain of the movie, Ralph Crawford (Ralf Harolde of course) - you know he is a villain because you first see him beating a horse!!! He is determined to go to the house and find the deed for himself. Surprise, Surprise - it just so happens that the home that interests Ralph and Richard so much is the house where Amos and Andy have to spend the night - it is an old lodge custom. They are searching for a paper that says \"Check and Double Check\" on it and of course they meet Ralph, papers get exchanged, Amos and Andy keep the deed and Ralph gleefully pockets the paper with \"Check and Double Check\" on it. The boys are pleased to present the deed to Richard, who is an old friend from down South.\n\nAside from the fantastic Duke Ellington, who's ten minute music session not only helped his career but bought a lot of patrons to the theatre, the lasting appeal of the movie was the song \"Three Little Words\" - sung by an unseen Rhythm Boys (featuring Bing Crosby).

(Actually their only other live-action film appearance was in The Big Broadcast of 1936.) Now these two were the most popular comedians on the audio medium at the time but whatever appeal they had there is mostly lost here as they don't do or say much that's funny. Exceptions are when Amos is on the phone and he says something inappropriate because Andy is shouting something before hand and a rear projection sequence when Amos is almost \"hitting\" another car and Andy covers his head in fear. Other than that, it's just lame dialogue after lame dialogue. What's even more lame is the extra subplot concerning a young rich white man who we find out is a long-lost friend of these characters that you just can't believe at all! Anyway, those two main characters aren't the reason I'm reviewing this for BHM, no way! No, it's the fact this was the first time Duke Ellington and the Cotton Club band appeared in a feature film (as opposed to some shorts previously) and were their usual entertaining selves. They alone are what make Check and Double Check worth a look. P.S. One of the players is Sue Carol who, like me, is a Chicago native but more importantly eventually quit acting to become an agent who among her clients was her future husband, Alan Ladd.",

That friends gets into some trouble so the boys try to help him out. I'm downloaded and listened to a couple of the radio shows and they certainly appear better on the radio. Perhaps it's seeing Amos and Andy being played in blackface, which just doesn't sit well today but even with the blackface, none of the jokes really come across as funny.

It's a sad look back at 1930 when you realize that this film was mainstream and was based on one of the most popular radio programs of the day--a program where white actors played very stereotypical blacks (fortunately, when the show came to TV, they actually used black actors). The frequent use of ignorant vocabulary and an absence of anything other than demeaning depictions of blacks as either domestics or objects to be laughed at was the norm in films. HOWEVER, as a history teacher I have a strong bias against ignoring our politically incorrect past and was curious to see this film--warts and all.\n\nIn some ways the film was a real disappointment. First, the film consisted of two plots (one involving a white couple--and it was irrelevant to the film) when I had assumed it would be about Amos, Andy and the Kingfish. Second, although the depictions of the black characters was negative, believe it or not, I expected it to be a lot worse. No, I am not saying the film was a positive depiction--I just thought the negative stereotypes might be even worse! Third, as a comedy, the film just isn't all that funny. In fact, I have barely a smirk during the entire film.\n\nThe title \"Check and Double Check\" refers to a piece of paper the men are delegated to retrieve by their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea. It's hidden in a haunted house and Amos and Andy are given this dubious honor---well over halfway through the film! It really took a very long time for this plot to be introduced. In the meantime, you have the insipid plot about the white lovers and a baddie and an interesting musical interlude that introduced white audiences to the Duke Ellington Orchestra--something that IS worth seeing and is an important part of history and the Harlem Renaissance. Yes, the movie has some racist elements--but it also was, in a bizarre way, rather progressive. After all, Duke Ellington was quite black and the average person seeing this film was being exposed to at least some positive aspect of black American culture.",

Every ugly stereotype is on abundant display in this nasty bit of celluloid, whose target audience these days consists of willfully ignorant bigots, lightly retarded weasels and Don Imus fans.\n\nAs depicted by the popular (at the time) black face minstrel show duo, African-Americans are lazy, stupid, cowardly, speak comically broken English, and pine for them \"good ol'days\" of the racist Jim Crow south. We're also treated to a heap of cringingly racist \"O lawdy lawdy, i'se a-fraid o' them spooks! Yahsuh!\" sort of bigoted \"humor\" that would make anyone with the slightest sense of justice want to take a flamethrower to every print of this cinematic turd.\n\nMelville Brown's deadpan direction does nothing to enhance Godsen & Correll's blackface minstrel show act. The non Amos and Andy dialog is so clunky and trite that even the actors who aren't in black face can't seem to take any of it seriously. Irene Rich and Edward Martindel, both respected veteran silent film actors, look lost and faintly embarrassed among the RKO B-listers trying to make something coherent of the film's sub-sub-par plot.\n\nMany films of the 1920s and 30s were lost to history due to neglect. That this racist toad of a film survived when so many other, by far better, (or at least less cringingly racist) films perished is a fine example of the basic injustice of the universe. Not only is Check and Double Check a prime example of how not to make a movie - it's also stellar example of just how bad the \"good ol' days\" really were.",

                "text": "The plot to \"Borrowed Wives\" is pretty bad--and 100% ridiculous! Peter Foley owes money but cannot pay it off until he marries. This is because he is receiving a stipend from his Uncle Henry and it will only be increased when he gets married. He plans on marrying his sweetheart but when her train is delayed, Mr. Parker INSISTS he be paid off NOW or go to jail. And, Parker suggest they use his secretary to pose as Foley's wife in order to make the uncle happy and release the inheritance. This is an amazingly contrived plot--but it gets worse. It seems that Henry and his wife live in a spooky old haunted house!!!! AND, then the woman who Peter planned on marrying arrives at the house with another man!! What?!?!?!?!?! Does any of this make any sense and is there any part of this plot that doesn't sound stupid? If you answered no to both these questions, then I can pretty much say the movie is not worth your time. If, somehow this sound like a good film, then by all means try it--just don't invite me over to watch this turkey!",

                "text": "Hans Tintner's 1930 film, Cyankali \u0096 Cyanide - is as much a social commentary and plea for liberalised abortion laws, as it is a highly watchable, if harrowing, melodrama. For most of its 85 minutes, the movie is silent with inter-titles, however in the final scenes, we are magically transported into the world of the talkie, as the tragedy which has unfolded reaches its denouement.\n\nAnd the scene is set, with the sobering official figures of the time: up to 800 000 abortions are performed in Germany each year, with up to 10 000 resulting in the death of the mother.\n\nThe seedy northern districts of Berlin. Poverty, unemployment and labour unrest.\n\nThe beautiful Hedwig \u0096 Heti \u0096 lives a meagre existence with her widowed mother in a typically dank apartment, but there is the promise of a better life with Paul from the factory. And telling him of her pregnancy, they both for a moment dream in beatific innocence of a perfect world, in a place of their own. Paul is an honourable man who shares her joy, and he will accept his responsibilities as a father and provider.\n\nBut they are suddenly cast adrift from that ideal future by the news that an industrial dispute has shut down the factory. How can they possibly afford a child now? The ravages of poverty on neighbouring families have been plainly evident: Mrs Witt has jumped to her death with one of her many children. The futility of a life with a drunken unemployed husband. For the 17 year old Heti, such stultifying emptiness is not an option.\n\nPaul and his friend Max must resort to burglary \u0096 of the factory canteen no less \u0096 in an effort to put food on the table, and while this doesn't sit at all well with Heti's mother, who refuses to take part in this feast, she can't help but notice the irony: for her life of honesty, she has been repaid with hunger. And it is at that table too, as the vile landlord makes an uninvited entrance, that Heti informs her mother of her situation. \n\nThere seems no other escape from her current dark morass, than to seek medical assistance.\n\nIt is then that we are offered another stark glimpse of the times; an altogether different, though no less confronting one.\n\nFresh from a flirtatious consultation with an obviously well heeled \u0096 if sadly indisposed \u0096 young lady, where he fabricates a legal scenario for her to undergo an abortion, the respectable doctor makes a point of telling young Heti that he is sorry, but it is illegal in Germany to provide this service for her. The law does not take economic hardships into consideration. \n\nThe only illness she is suffering is poverty, and while her pleas may elicit some pity, she is left with no choice but to seek help elsewhere. He warns her then of the dangers which lurk beyond his doors: unclean instruments, and the dreaded cyanide, a not-uncommon method of termination. Indiscriminate and random.\n\nBut you are the one who is sending me there!\n\nIn desperation, she is drawn to a small classified notice in the newspaper which offers a discreet service to women and girls.\n\nThe termination is procured. Cynically\u0085haggling over cost\u0085unclean hands on unclean instruments. And to be absolutely sure, she is given a phial of liquid to take home. To take from it five drops in water. \n\nStaggering, fevered.\n\nHer mother knows why, but her daughter is now home. Safe at least, please. \n\nThe drops. The fever. She can't take them, and fearfully begs for help. \n\nThis won't kill me, will it mother?\n\nAnd so it is at this moment that some rather interesting things begin happening; incongruous moments that were perhaps part of the original print, or which came as a result of some re-editing.\n\nIt is 1930 and we are on the cusp of sound. There were hints of this throughout the first half of Cyankali: the use of crowd noises, knocking on a door, and all the while a richly diverse, musical background. Yet then for extended periods, a white silence. \n\nHeti's cyanide cocktail brings on the spoken \u0096 or rather \u0096 the sung word, and we find ourselves being entertained (sic) by a neighbour singing in her apartment, while accompanying herself on guitar.\n\nThen Heti calls, vocalises, to her mother for help. Not as escape from the guitar playing neighbour, but for the physical pain she is enduring. The anxious questioning.\n\nIt is here too in the final scenes that we listen to the impassioned pleas of Max and Paul, as they are brought by police into the dying girl's room, suspected of having procured a crime against the unborn. Impassioned demands for birth control, coordinated by the state, to save women from these amateur abortionists.\n\nEvery year, 800 000 mothers end up breaking the law\u0085A law which makes them criminals is no just law!\n\nHeti's mother will soon be arrested for administering that fatal dose, while Heti opines to the screen, her final words: tens of thousands have to die. Will no one help us?\n\nThere is a terrible inevitability to this movie. The era of the Third Reich was near, and one is left to ponder the effect its message may have had on the movie-going public of the time. For the National Socialists, the blood of the Volk was sacrosanct. It was to be nurtured and worshiped, for in it, by it and through it, the destiny of Germany rested. Abortions were for the racially impure and the genetically suspect.\n\nThe actress Grete Mosheim, who played the tragic Heti, fled Germany for England in 1933 because of her Jewish heritage. \n\nThis is an important document from the Weimar period.",

                "text": "\nAccording to Miles Kreuger,this production began in April 1930 as a\nlarge-scale 90 minute musical comedy announced for a mid-summer opening.About the same time the public's enthusiasm for musicals had dried up. FOX decided to cut four of the eight musical numbers and offer it to the public as a 60 minute  straight comedy with songs. When it was finally previewed in November 1930 to the trade publications, it was widely ridiculed. FOX then slipped it into second-run and neighborhood theatres rather than premier it. VARIETY helped seal it fate with a devasting review in July 1931, declaring it a ridiculous farce.\n\nReportedly the film was revived at the New York Film Festival in 1969 and\n\nshown at MOMA in the 1970s to an appreciative audience. The famous fox hunt scene in AUNTIE MAME must have been lifted from this film. Also, LADY TUBBS (1935) copied it. Ricard Barrios' \"A Song in the Dark\" describes the film at length and comments on the contrasting performances of Lillie and Baclanova.\n\nIn conclusion, it would seem that a headstrong international cast grabbed the reins from a novice director and proceded to have a field day. I enjoy screening my 16mm - 23 minute excerpt of ARE YOU THERE? which included three songs and alot of very bizarre comedy. One only could hope that the 60 minute version had more public exposure and that the missing four musical production numbers and 30 minutes of footage would miraculously be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "\n    Interesting, rarely seen film that is notable for the re-teaming of Jean Hersholt and Gibson Gowland, who made such memorable enemies in Erich von Stroheim's GREED (1924).  For genre fans though it is also memorable as the first screen appearance of Rondo Hatton.  Filmed in Florida, Hatton was working as a reporter for the Tampa Herald at the time and was probably spotted there by director Henry King.  Though Hatton's glandular condition, acromegaly, was already noticeable we can see it is not nearly as pronounced as it was in his later Universal films.  Rondo has the small role of the bartender in a dusty dive in the small coastal village where the action takes place.  He may or may not have any lines.  In one scene where the lights go out and a murder takes place a voice cries out \"He's done for!\" and that MIGHT be Rondo's voice but it is hard to tell.     Henry King gave Rondo that old line (which was probably a cliche even in 1930) \"If you ever come to Hollywood come and see me.\"  Well it took Hatton 7 years to make up his mind but finally he boarded a train for the west coast, leaving behind a wife who thought he was wasting his time.  His first film in Hollywood was IN OLD CHICAGO (1937) also directed by Henry King.  Rondo is billed 17th in the credits and listed as \"bodyguard\" though several people in the film call his character \"Rondo\".  It was the start of a short but memorable career, capped by immortality in 3 Universal pictures where he played the spine snapping \"Creeper\".    Nicely done Rondo, you lived the dream.",

With the pearls, he hopes to marry Henry Morgan's daughter. Morgan (Gibson Gowland) is more than happy to essentially sell Anita (Lupe Valez) and force her to marry Joseph. Additionally, Anita learns that there's a plan to cheat an American out of his pearls and kill him! But Anita loves the guy and is determined to help the American.\n\nThis film is a very low budgeted B made by a poverty row studio, Inspiration. Because of this, despite the tropical location, the film just looks cheap. There is no incidental music (not too unusual for 1930) but the acting and actors just seem rough...very, very rough. The film is actually very hard to watch and I became bored with it almost instantly!

Well one of the two things he wants. The other is pearls and trader Jean Hersholt has those. He also wants Lupe and Lupe's dead Gibson Gowland is quite willing to promote a marriage like that. Hersholt and Gowland have plans for Holland that don't include matrimony.\n\nThe location shooting in Tampa and surrounding environs substitute well for the Caribbean. Well it's close enough in any event. You'll also see cowboy sidekick Al St.John in an unusual non-western role as one of the island denizens. But of course there's the seductive Lupe Velez who got everyone's 1930 mojo going. Also unusual to see Jean Hersholt who is best remembered as the kindly Dr. Christian in a villainous part.\n\nWhat Lupe Velez had never goes out of style.",

He is known in classic movies for playing the kindly Dr. Christian as well as his character roles in such classics as \"Grand Hotel\", \"Dinner at Eight\" and \"Heidi\". But he also played his share of brutish characters, and here, he is absolutely wretched.\n\nThis is a tropical island where the spitfire Lupe Velez is attacked by him and manages to get the lecherous man off of her. Desperate to get to Havana and away from the evil Hetdhokt and her opportunistic father, Velez looks for whatever form of escape that she can find. When a handsome stranger arrives, it appears that her prayers have been answered.\n\nWhat starts off as interesting becomes a painful, creaky bore, a tedious melodrama of pearl diving and revenge between Hetholt, Velez and newcomer John Holland, resulting in murder and false accusations. Even an hour long edited print is insufferable with long dramatic pauses in many scenes and very dark photography. I couldn't imagine suffering from another 20-30 minutes of it.\n\nIt has the potential of being a curiosity of some interest but other than having the legendary Henry King as its director, it truly had nothing to get me interested in it.

This pre-code has a reputation of being fairly dirty but I think most of the elements are rather weak or at least not as strong as some previous films. Sure, most of what we see here would be a major no no within a couple years but there are still much better and much dirtier pre-codes out there. In a lot of ways the story reminded me somewhat of D.W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS because both films deal with a sweet girl being abused both mentally and physically by their father. King was a follower of Griffith so I do wonder if certain scenes in that 1919 classic were in his mind while filming this. The biggest problem I had with the film was the direction, which was quite weak from the start and things never really picked up until the very end. The current DVD offers the film up in an \"uncut\" 84-minute version and a shorter, wider released 63-minute version. I elected to watch the shorter version because several reviews I read said it was the better one and it isn't missing any of the \"pre-code\" stuff. From what I've read, the studio realized they had a pretty weak film so they took out a lot of the dialogue and released it with everything else in tact. I briefly jumped through the longer version and the majority of the uncut footage is just dialogue scenes that really add up to nothing. The pacing in the shorter version is pretty bad and it's even worse in the longer one because it never seems obvious what the director or screenwriter were trying to do. Velez dances around constantly trying to sell her innocence while the men look dirty and act like slime. Nothing ever really happens because the characters just talk, talk and talk some more and quite often these scenes just go no where as if they were just made up on the spot and the actors didn't know when to quit talking. Velez is pretty good in her role but the screenplay doesn't do her character much justice. The same is true with Holland who pretty much just stands around waiting to rescue the girl. Fans of GREED will enjoy seeing Hersholt and Gowland working together again and Universal horror fans will see a young Rondo Hatton in his first film. HELL HARBOR is a pretty weak movie all around and there's certainly not enough to make it worth sitting through unless you're a fan of one of the stars and must see everything they've done.",

                "text": "Untamed is famous for being Joan Crawford's first talkie, a curiosity. I had heard it was only a mediocre film by both fans of Crawford and those who really do not care for her. I was surprised that I liked it so much considering these reviews; Untamed is a good quality early talkie and a bright spot in Crawford's early career.\n\nCrawford plays \"Bingo,\" an untamed girl from the jungles of South America whose father dies, leaving her with a large oil inheritance. Some old friends of the family escort her to New York where she is to live in luxury, but they are startled when she abruptly falls in love with Robert Montgomery. They convince her that there are hundred of men like him in New York; she goes there to find that she yearns for him more than ever. She finds that he misses her too and the two plan to get married, until Crawford's uncle meddles again. The end of this film is quite shocking, and there are plenty of moments to entertain throughout.\n\nUnlike her later 1930s films, Crawford is wild and free here, sort of like a Trilby yet to find her Svengali. Her personality is radiant and she acts much more like a savage than a society girl. This pre-code film has her kicking her legs up to throw up her skirt, sleeping in a man's room, seeing him before he is dressed, drinking large quantities of alcohol during Prohibition, and condoning violence, an unladylike characteristic. Montgomery is terribly handsome in this film, a great romantic lead for Crawford. Perhaps this is the reason they starred in several other films together. The two sing several times here; neither has an outstanding voice, but the music helps add some realism and entertainment to the screen.\n\nOverall, this is not only a curiosity, but a great early film. It does not suffer from the slow pacing, static camera, wordy dialogue, and loud silences that other early talkies did. Be sure to give it a proper chance.",

Robert Montgomery and Crawford's characters love each other, but because she is rich and he has little money, he is afraid to marry her because of what people might think. Bingo's uncle Ben also discourages the relationship and offers Montgomery money to leave her! Of course, everything goes astray and uncle Ben's plans fall through in a hilarious fashion.

The entire film has a pretty strange vibe to it because when we first meet the Bingo character she's doing some crazy tribal dance and you really think that she's some wild child that you'd expect to see in a Lon Chaney film. After no time she settles down to be quite normal and this here is never really explained but Crawford's performance was pretty interesting. She was somewhat over-the-top in a good way while playing the wild child but she settled down during the section portion of the film and in the end she's the only reason to watch this thing. It's rather amazing to see how well she transformed into a sound star and you have to think that she was among the best to do so. Montgomery isn't too bad in his part but the screenplay does him no favors. Torrence is a tad bit all over the place but I still enjoyed watching him.

                "text": "Untamed is a dusty old creaker that has the distinction of being Joan Crawford's first talkie after years of mostly forgettable silent films. The plot is about an oil heiress named Bingo (Crawford) raised in the jungle by her father. She's pretty much a wild child though nothing like Tarzan. More like a hillbilly or something I guess. She's uncouth, as the kids might say. Anyway her father is killed and his two friends (Holmes Herbert and an overacting Ernest Torrence) decide to take her to New York to become civilized. On the ship she meets Robert Montgomery and falls in love. Being this is Joan's first talking picture, I'll cut her some slack. Her acting in the dramatic scenes was pretty bad but she does better with the comedy. Overall, a curio but nothing more. If you're a die-hard fan of Joan's, check it out.

Joan is lovably fresh in her first talkie as the improbably nick-named Bingo, falling head over heels in love with poor but noble Andy McAllister. When she gets the monkey off her back (literally; she's grown up in the jungle), she moves to the city with her \"uncles\" (really her father's friends who are charged with her care) and enters society, with a little help from the MGM make-up, hair, and deportment departments. Can Bingo and Andy make a go of it? Will Andy go back to his girlfriend? Will Bingo realize one of her \"uncles\" likes her in that special way? As others have said, it's a wildly improbable tale but it is fun to watch such an early talkie, when everything was so awkward and painful, like adolescence. Montgomery in the fight scenes was indeed pale and slender; in fact, a muscular double had to be used for him during the strip-search scene in \"The Big House.\" Oh, well. Men were littler then. Some of us like the suave, intellectual type.\n\nNot a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Interesting to note the use of card titles in this movie, and also Joan's rather stilted emoting, both holdovers from the silent days which really were just days behind at that point.

But Joan Crawford's 'camp' credentials are unquestioned, and 'Untamed' is a campfest. Those who like to see Joan Crawford in queen-bee mode (you know who you are) will enjoy this film immensely. Me, I liked Joan better in 'Daisy Kenyon'.\n\nHere, she's cast as Bingo Dowling -- yes, Bingo! -- an oil heiress who's been living in the remote jungle with two older men named Murchison and Presley, whom she calls her 'uncles'. She takes a shine to handsome young Andy McAllister, and the two of them warble some bad songs. This movie was made in 1929, when silent films were fading fast and the Hollywood studios were scrambling to prove that their stars could not only talk but even sing. Actually, Joan was a pretty good singer and dancer in 'Hollywood Revue of 1929', but her singing in 'Untamed' is quite dire. And the sound recording is bad: well below the usual high standard of Douglas Shearer and MGM.\n\nSpeaking of which: MGM were consistently the studio with the best production values, the most opulent sets and the most stylish costumes. You'd hardly know it here. Several exterior sequences -- notably in the jungle -- have clearly been filmed indoors on a set-dressed soundstage. Several other sets are too swank for their own good. A simple little shop is kitted out like a posh emporium. As Bingo, Crawford flashes too many bangles, and her jewellery tends to rattle loudly in the bad sound mix.\n\nSPOILERS NOW. Eventually, Bingo shoots Andy (good idea!) but they fall in love anyway (bad idea!).\n\nI consider myself a Joan Crawford fan (for several reasons) but 'Untamed' is not her finest hour. I'll give some slack to all concerned, as this talkie was made during Hollywood's awkward transition period. For that reason, and out of sentiment for Joan Crawford, I'll rate this movie 4 out of 10 ... but I'm being generous.",

Yes, it's an early talkie but it's a good one - as good if not better than SMART MONEY and on its way to being PUBLIC ENEMY just a year later.   The story (the usual crime does not pay moral with some twists) is a good one, strong on character and deserved its Oscar nomination.  Lew Ayres gives what I consider to be his best screen performance, as a young and intelligent crime boss.  Cagney, sixth billed, is his henchman and here impresses no end - he is completely at home in the talkie medium with a performance full of nuances and naturalism.  No wonder he headed right to the top.\n\nLouie Ricarno (Ayres) organizes the various hoods in his city into a conglomerate to protect each others' interests and eliminate gang wars, which profit no one.   Once he has achieved this he retires to marry and raise his kid brother, currently in a military academy.   One hitch here is that the woman he marries is also sweet on his henchman, Steve Mileaway (Cagney) and the feeling is returned.   All goes well until the mob starts to break apart and tries to lure Louie back to the city by attempting to kidnap his young brother.  The kidnap attempt goes awry and the boy is killed.  Louie, now hardened more than ever, returns to the city, swearing vengeance.   I won't reveal the rest of the plot, but it is well acted and well characterized.   True, the direction is sluggish and the other actors are not up to the professionalism of Ayres and Cagney, but it must take its place with the other early crime melodramas (FIVE STAR FINAL, LITTLE CAESAR, PUBLIC ENEMY, G-MEN) as being top of the line.",

The notion that a pretty young boy can't be a gangster is belied both by Ayres' performance and by history itself--Pretty Boy Floyd, anyone? (I should add, however, that Jimmy Cagney, in his autobiography, agreed with those who believed Ayres was too pretty to play a convincing gangster!)\n\nThis film is so much better than you'd think, and that is due not only to fine performances by Ayres and Cagney (make that, a WONDERFUL performance by Cagney, who really does ignite the screen), but also to impressive direction by Archie Mayo. I confess I usually think of Mayo as a pretty journeyman director, but maybe I've only seen his later work and \"talkies\" spoiled him. If you were to watch this film without sound, you'd be hyper-aware of the wonderful camera set-ups and editing, particularly during the prison break, when the screen is filled with jump cuts of men's legs running. Of course, without the sound, you'll miss the great period dialogue (a gangland ambush offers Ayres the opportunity to \"walk into a handful of clouds\").\n\nTCM shows this film from time to time, and you really shouldn't miss it.

Billed way at the bottom of the opening credits as simply \"gangster\", Dwight's character is called \"Monk\" and is one of the first people we meet in the film.  That old cliche of the gangster who carries a tommy-gun in a violin case got started with this film and Dwight is the fellow toting the lethal instrument.  When he strolls out of a pool room with his violin case under his arm he offhandedly comments \"I'm gonna teach a guy a lesson.\" with a sardonic smile on his face.  The lines \"Take a guy for a ride\" and \"Put a guy on the spot\" originated with this film too. Lew Ayers, fresh from ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is the real hero, or should I say anti-hero, of the movie and Cagney exhibits the screen personality that aimed him directly at the bullseye of Hollywood stardom but being a lifelong fan of character actors, I now like this film for Dwight Frye's brief, but memorable, appearance.",

Funny how Cagney's smart aleck attitude and mannerisms got him stereotyped as a gangster right out of the block, and he made it seem all so natural.\n\nAs for the story, Warner Brothers takes yet another stab at the menace to society theme with it's take on mob violence and competition between rival gangs. This was my first look at Lew Ayres, who heads the cast as crime boss Louie Ricarno. In an opening scene, he's out to 'teach a guy a lesson' for being a rat, and from there he sees an opportunity to bring all the local big shots together under his own umbrella. Though generally effective in the role, I did find it somewhat humorous when Ayres went into that surly pensive mood from time to time throughout the story. I also got a kick out of the scene in which Ricarno fancies himself as big a man as Napoleon, and Cagney does a mock impersonation of the dictator to the amusement of Louie's girl Doris (Dorothy Matthews).\n\nWith the back drop of Louie going straight and retiring to Miami with his new wife, the film throws a minor curve with the autobiography he's writing. I thought for sure that police captain Pat Grady (Robert Elliott - O'Grady in the credits) had it right when he offered the suggestion - \"Don't write the last chapter till the night you go to the chair\". Instead, knowing that there's no safe way out of the flop house he's holed up in, Louie gussies himself up for a 'handful of cloud'. The finale is effective for Warners' purposes, the fade out hones in on the rewritten last page of the Louie Ricarno story, the 'doorway to hell' swings only one way.\n\nKeep a sharp eye and you'll catch a typo in the gangland slaughter headline of the newspaper Louie reads in the boarding house - it reads 'grewsome' for 'gruesome'.\n\nFor an early talking picture, I found the film to be fairly well written and acted, most of that contribution coming from the main principals, Ayres and Cagney. I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risqu\u00e9 stuff for the 1930's. The scene in the cab when she removes her ring probably brought a few gasps to audiences of the time, don't you think?",

Cagney is great as usual as the head gangster's top henchman. Lew Ayres acts well as the head guy, \"the Napoleon of crime\", although he's perhaps a little too cleancut looking for the role.\n\nThe story is good, and rather dark. Mobster Louie Ricarno, after uniting all the gangs in Chicago under one organization, tries to quit crime. But things fall apart in his absence, and he's forced to return for purposes of revenge. The ending is nicely grim and while there might be enough of a \"crime doesn't pay\" moral to keep the censors happy it doesn't rub it in your face. There's some good gangster violence along the way.- a number of well-done hits, and an over- the-top scene that resembles a full-scale battle.\n\nTwo other things struck me as memorable: The adulterous relationship between Cagney and his boss' wife. At one point, she takes off her wedding ring, and then they \"go somewhere\".\n\nThe police captain, O'Grady, is a rather ruthless character. He blackmails Cagney into a false confession for a crime he didn't commit, by threatening to tell Ayres about his affair with Ayres's wife! Later, he lets Ayres's rivals bump him off, rather than prosecute him and risk an acquittal. It also is implied that O'Grady's rejection of bribes is more the exception than the rule among police officials.\n\nIt pays to watch this movie closely, as there is a lot that is implied and innuendoed.",

In spite of some beefing by the other gangsters at first, in the long run this ends the in-fighting and all the gangsters make more money in the bootleg booze business and like the arrangement. Ricarno makes more money than any of them and this enables him to marry his dream-girl, retire, and live the life of a gentleman in Florida. At something like the tender age of 25 he is even writing his memoirs. However, he has two problems. First, you can take the girl out of the speak-easy (his wife) but you can't take the speak-easy out of the girl. Secondly, once Louie is retired, the same old in-fighting starts up again among the gangsters he left behind and they yearn for Louie to return and restore order. When he refuses, a couple of the gangsters cook up a plan to force him to return that goes horribly wrong and ends up killing someone close to Louie. Full of vengeance, Louie does return home, but not to restore order.\n\nCagney here has a minor role as right hand man to Louie and one-time boyfriend of Louie's now bored wife Doris. He's perfect in the role since his openly wise-guy exterior is in sharp contrast to Ayres' gee-whiz personna, in spite of the fact that they are equally violent.\n\nLouie is a sympathetic character in many ways. He isn't someone who just picked crime as a career. Instead he grew up in poverty, lost his parents at a young age, lost two siblings to typhoid from bad milk, and just doesn't know any other way to live than dog eat dog. This doesn't excuse what he does, but it is something of an explanation. In this sense this film is ahead of its time in complexity.

                "text": "In 1930 Lew Ayres was Hollywood's golden boy having scored a huge success in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" for Universal, then Warners borrowed him for the baby faced gangster in \"The Doorway to Hell\". He plays Louie Ricarno, an Underworld king pin who proceeds to re-organise the rackets - not to everyone's satisfaction. While \"Little Caesar\" dealt with the rise of a mobster within an organised crime ring and \"The Public Enemy\" was about a pair of thugs making their way up in the criminal world, \"The Doorway to Hell\" tried to deal with the complexities of a gangster, even as the film starts, already called \"King of the Underworld\", who wants out but is not allowed to break away.\n\nThe whole point of the film was (to me) someone struggling with their inner demons that were triumphing over his basic goodness. The role needed a clean cut actor who was believable, especially when he left the rackets to try and live a normal life and Lew Ayres was perfect, however he didn't have much of a presence in the scenes where he was doing some tough talking to his mob. It didn't help that his off-sider, Mileaway, was played by James Cagney - only his second film but he was already acting like a veteran. Even when he was almost out of the scene, a shrug of the shoulders, raised eyebrows, that \"crazy\" grin meant that audiences were watching him instead of Ayres - fortunately audiences were going to see a lot more of him in years to come.\n\nThere is always a woman - this time, Doris (Dorothy Matthews), a moll, who thrives on the excitement of crime. Ricarno marries her and for her sake and for his little brother, Jackie (Leon Janney) who is away at military school, doesn't know what his big brother does and of course idolizes him - decides to give the mob away and try to write his memoirs. Doris is bored and misses Mileaway (with whom she is having a hot and heavy affair). In the meantime, without Louie's organization there is a lot of gangland violence and when two thugs, Gimpy and the Midget try to kidnap Jackie, their plan is stymied and as Jackie runs away from them he is run over and killed by a passing truck. This paves the way for Louie's return but strangely the film slows down after this. With many of the gangsters dead the police become more involved and the last 20 minutes really drag with Mileaway's confession (he only signs because he doesn't want Louie to find out about him and Doris, Louie, of course, believes he is a real pal). Louie battles with his inner demons - he may outwardly appear \"preppie\" but he idolizes Napoleon and feels War is the answer to the World's problems (obviously, in view of his real life beliefs, he didn't sound very convincing) - what a complete turnaround from his last role as the disillusioned soldier. He also has some scenes with honest cop, Captain O'Grady (Robert Elliot) who seems to be Louie's conscience.\n\nThe film's pace could have been tighter and consequently the film doesn't have the same impact as \"Little Caesar\" or \"The Public Enemy\". It was interesting to see the violin cases come out and to know that it originated in this movie - now it is such a clich\u00e9. Noel Madison, who played Rocco, the only gangster, who didn't fall for Louie's tough talk, also made his debut, along with Cagney in \"Sinner's Holiday\" and was forever typecast as gangsters and thugs - a bit different to his stage career where he specialized in society types.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

                "text": "When I refer to the 'Big Three' I am of course referring to the holy trinity of early 1930's gangster flicks: Little Caesar, The Public Enemy & Scarface.\n\nFirstly, this is NOT a James Cagney movie. It's a Lew Ayres movie in which James Cagney, (In only his second movie), is amongst the great supporting cast and based on this performance it was easy to see the star in the making.\n\nLew Ayres plays Louie Ricarno, a bootlegging gangster determined to get rich or die trying. Cagney plays Mileaway, his right hand man who's character seems to be well named as whenever any of the action takes place in the movie, Cagney seems to be a 'mile away' from it, as it's one of the few Cagney movies made where he doesn't either kill, mame or even hit anyone.\n\nAfter a series of tit-for-tat murders between rival gangs, Ricarno calls a meeting with all his rival bosses and proposes that in return for them declaring him ultimate boss, he will protect their operations from any rival gang who may try to encroach on their areas. One wonders whether Charles 'Lucky' Luciano ever saw this movie and used this element of it's plot as his blueprint for the 'syndicate' which he adopted after the murder of crime boss Salvatore Maranzano a year later.\n\nAfter a period of profitable peace for all involved, Ricarno feels that he's made enough money to quit the rackets for good and go straight. His two main reasons for this life style U turn, is his new wife Doris, (Dorothy Mathews), (who unbeknown to him is having a passionate affair with his best friend Mileaway), and his young Brother Jackie, played brilliantly by Leon Janney. Louie doesn't want Jackie to either follow in his footsteps or even rub shoulders with the ne'r-do-well's he does.\n\nIt's not long after louie's departure that old gang fueds come to the fore once more and gangland killings escalate. In order to incite Louie back to the city, two gangsters plot to kidnap Jackie only to release him when Louie returns. However, the kidnapping is botched as Jackie, who blessed with intelligence of his brother, smells a rat. In his bid to escape, he is knocked over and killed by a passing truck.\n\nOn hearing the news, Louie, now driven solely by vengeance on the would be kidnappers, returns to his old turf, but peace & profits are the last thing on his mind, and you half expect him to utter Al Pacino's memorable line \"Just when I thought I was out....they pull me back in\"\n\nAyres, although brilliant in his role was probably miscast, especially when you had the best movie tough guy in world playing the lead's sidekick. (A mistake they nearly duplicated with The Public Enemy until the producers woke up).\n\nOne let down of the movie was the rivalry between Ayres and fellow gang boss Rocco (Noel Madison), I feel the bitterness between the two needed to be brought out in the plot a little more. Sadly, because they didn't do this, the movie is robbed of any REAL menacing villain.\n\nThe Pre-code element was also very risqu\u00e9 and the fact that the affair between Cagney's & Mathews's chaarcters was so obviously sexual, must have had all at the Hays office pulling their hair out.\n\nLike in most early talkies, many cast members seem to struggle with adapting to the new medium, such as adopting wild animated body gestures as they would have done in silent pictures and also speaking terribly slowly as they were so often told to do. Luckily both Ayres & Cagney are on hand to show them that you didn't need to speak three words a minute to be understood on film.\n\nDoorway to Hell is a great early Warner's gangster movie and worth giving a go.\n\nEnjoy!",

Louie's wife decided that by taking off her wedding ring it made it legal for her to fool around, which must have shocked the audiences of the 1930's.  All these actors were just starting their careers in this film and gangster films were very popular.  If you look close, you will also see Dwight Frye (Monk, a gangster),\"Frankenstein\",'31 and Ward Bond(a policeman that was uncredited in this picture) Ward Bond appeared in many of John Wayne Western Films.

                "text": "This pre-Code gangster movie is interesting primarily because of James Cagney, who is in a supporting role, that of a gangster's right-hand man. His boss is played somewhat improbably by 21- year-old Lew Ayres, who is hard to believe as he threatens rival gang members to fall in line under his authority. However, fall in line they do, that is, until Ayres decides he's had enough and decides to retire. (Yes, the pretty boy baby-face had had enough of the game, when it looks like he hasn't started shaving) When he's gone, all hell breaks loose for reasons we can't really fathom, prompting them to attempt to reel him back in by kidnapping his kid brother, who is away at a military school. \n\nAyres is one of the casting issues; the other is the policeman played by Robert Elliott, who is far too lethargic as he delivers his lines. The script is actually pretty good, and there are some lines that are wry and just perfect for the genre and time period. The ending is drawn out, however, and it's too bad the story surrounding the love interest (played well by Dorothy Matthews) who marries Ayres but secretly loves Cagney isn't expanded on, though the scene where she coyly slips off her wedding ring to encourage him is nice. The movie hits you over the head with an anti-crime message, but as you think about the actions of the police officer, coercing statements and selectively deciding who to protect, you have to wonder how effective this message was. Anyway, the net of all of this is a reasonably entertaining movie, but nothing to write home about. \n\nThis was only Cagney's 2nd movie, just before a string of movies the following year which would cement him as a star, most notably, The Public Enemy, and he's such a natural with great screen presence. As a footnote, I found it ironic that while Ayres in the movie lauds Napoleon, his brother's military training, and war in general, Ayres in real life was a conscientious objector during WWII, making him very unpopular at the time, though he served with honor in the medical corps instead.",

                "text": "This is a very early talkie gangster film. Because it was made only a few years after talking pictures debuted, it suffers from a few defects that were related to the technology--such as an over-reliance on long shots--making the film look a bit \"stagy\". Additionally, background and incidental music in the film is noticeably absent. You really can't blame the filmmakers, as the technology was new and they still had to work out a few kinks, but it does make the film seem pretty dated and creaky. It wasn't until a year later that these two problems were pretty much eliminated in American films and even better gangster films like PUBLIC ENEMY and LITTLE CAESAR debuted.\n\nThe story itself is very interesting due to its cast. Lew Ayres, who had just made a name for himself in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, stars as a \"nice\" and \"respectable\" mob leader. Only late in the film do we see him unleash a wave of extreme violence. This is actually rather ironic considering that in real life, Ayres was strongly opposed to violence and when drafted in WWII, served as a medic because he was so morally opposed to taking lives! Also, this was only the second film for Jimmy Cagney. Since he wasn't an established star, it's not surprising he plays a supporting role though he already was being cast as a mobster in films.\n\nThe movie is in some ways a very typical Warner Brothers gangster film, though with one exception. Mob boss Ayres is a supposedly smart man and retires from the mob when he's still very young and able to enjoy the spoils of his work. But, when the gangs start fighting among themselves, he is reluctantly pulled back into the picture--leading to a rather dramatic conclusion. Interestingly, although the movie was pretty violent in spots and probably featured more gunfire than any film of the 30s, some of the key violent scenes are not seen but are only heard. An interesting idea no doubt spurred on by the new sound technology.",

Nothing says 20's flappers quite like that fashion. The movie may be an antique, but for a gangster film what it crucially lacks is needed grit. I'm guessing the boyishly handsome Ayers was cast as head gangster because he's supposed to be somewhat sympathetic in a way that the formidable Cagney, for example, wouldn't. Trouble is Ayers is too soft looking to be credible on the ruthless gangster side. Instead, he found his niche as the wholesome Dr. Kildare in that popular movie series.(Can't help noticing Ayers looks facially like his contemporary John Wayne then making oaters for Lone Star. See if you agree.).\n\nExcept for Cagney, the supporting cast remains obscure, maybe even for that time. Mathews, the feminine lead, hasn't much to do except cuddle covertly with Cagney. In fact, women scarcely appear at all. As a whole the movie's none too convincing, unlike Public Enemy, a year later. However, the script is pre-Code so the line between cops and robbers is none too clear, while Mathews' infidelity goes unpunished.

This is a film that leaves you twisted and thoughtful. The actors, particularly Carl Brisson and Anny Ondra, are all wonderfully expressive. Words aren't needed to know what they are saying and what they are feeling. Miss Ondra was ethereally beautiful and heartbreakingly convincing as Kate. Very highly recommend for all true Hitchcock fans and a must for the connoisseur of the silent genre.",

However while that earlier boxing drama eventually pulled its punch (excuse the pun), The Manxman is a far harsher affair, with a ruthless disregard for its characters' fates that prefigures film noir.\n\nAs was Hitchcock's style from his earliest works, his aim here as a director is to place the audience inside the scenario, no matter how uncomfortable it makes them. The film is almost entirely composed of point-of-view shots, and an unusually large number of them in which an actor looks straight into the camera. Time and time again Carl Brisson's big innocent face stares out at us, as if implicating us in the guilt of the other two leads.\n\nThis also happens to be one of a small number of Hitchcock pictures which is very beautiful to look at. There are plenty of exquisite location shots and great use of natural lighting, in ironic counterpoint to the darkness of the story.\n\nWhile not quite the best of them, The Manxman is perhaps the most confident of Hitchcock's silent pictures. Whereas the majority of his silents relied too much upon rather obvious expressionist camera techniques, The Manxman is shot much more straightforwardly, and yet it still has a smooth, flowing style and isn't cluttered up with too many title cards. For me though, Hitchcock didn't really become an interesting director until he started making talkies.",

                "text": "For me, this movie was an education in silent cinema.\n\nIt is crucial to see silent movies in a good print. The Studio Canal Manxman is not pristine but is as good as any movie that old is ever likely to be. Because I wasn't peering through scratches at jumpy, faded, fuzzy images, I could finally appreciate how good even very early cinematography was and that silent movie acting wasn't just crude gesticulating. Anny Ondra is a revelation and the movie is worth watching for her alone. However...\n\nThe movie is a love triangle. Inn-keeper's daughter Kate is in love with lawyer Phil, but agrees to marry his boyhood friend Pete, who then goes abroad to seek his fortune. She learns that Pete has died and gets closer to Phil. Pete unexpectedly returns and marries Kate. They have a child. Although Pete is a good husband and father, she continues to pine after Phil. Finally she leaves her husband, but Phil will not commit himself to her. She tries to reclaim her daughter, revealing that Pete is not the father. He refuses to give up the child and in despair she tries to commit suicide. She ends up in Court, where Phil is now the presiding magistrate. His role in the affair is revealed and he resigns his office to go off with Kate and their child. Pete is left distraught.\n\nThis is not a typical Hitchcock movie and he was always dismissive of it. He had no reason to be. It is a finely wrought melodrama with many effective and moving scenes and is as well made as any of his more characteristic films of the era, but it also illustrates the limitations of silent cinema as a dramatic medium.\n\nI haven't read the book on which The Manxman is based, but I suspect its whole thrust is quite different to this movie.\n\nPhil loves Kate, but feels marriage to her would damage his legal career. With Pete away he becomes increasingly infatuated with her and eventually seduces her. He ought to marry her, but is still torn between love and ambition. When he learns that Pete is alive and coming home to claim his bride, he uses loyalty to his friend as an excuse to evade his responsibility, but is still tortured to see her marrying another man. He goes away to pursue his legal career and achieves his ambition to be made 'Deemster'. When Kate leaves her husband he still prevaricates. It takes Kate's attempted suicide and his denunciation in Court to force him into the decision he should have taken years before.\n\nIt is really Phil's story and his moral dilemma is at its heart.\n\nAll of this can clearly be glimpsed in the movie, but doesn't drive it. For example, Phil's Aunt warns him against an imprudent marriage, but it is never clear that he is ambitious enough to heed her warning, so when he helps Pete to court Kate it is not obvious that his pain is largely self-inflicted: he actually comes across as a sad, romantic Cyrano de Bergerac figure.\n\nLater, when he steps aside in favour of Pete the duplicity of his motive can be inferred, but isn't really shown. Rather, he seems both honourable and generous. Even when Kate has left her husband, his internal conflict is not fully realised. His indecision seems almost accidental: the telephone always seems to be ringing at the wrong time.\n\nBecause the movie cannot quite get to grips with Phil's story, it becomes Kate's story by default.\n\nI don't think this is simply a failure of Hitchcock or his scenarist. It is also a failure of the medium. There are many great scenes in the movie: Phil helping Pete woo the woman he secretly loves himself; Kate's unexpected reaction to news of Pete's death; Phil's misreading of the situation when Pete wants to tell him that Kate is pregnant; Pete's discovery that his wife is missing; and many more. These are the sort of scenes that silent movies did best, so it is inevitable that the movie organises itself around them. But it also means that Phil's story loses its specificity and its central role.\n\nA whole generation of movie critics bitterly regretted the passing of the silent cinema and its 'universal language', but I think they misread the situation. By the early Twenties, movie-makers were becoming more and more ambitious and they were soon trying to tell stories that could not be told adequately in pantomime. They wanted to make drama, but the medium was always pushing them towards melodrama.\n\nOne clue to their dilemma was the tendency to overuse title cards to explain the more subtle and complex stories they were now trying to tell. For example, The Hunchback of Notre Dame has some great visual images, but is so peppered with title cards that you end up reading the movie rather than watching it. The problem for silent cinema is that people talk: that is what they do - most of the time! When The Manxman was made, silent movies had long been crying out for sound.\n\nThe silent cinema had a universality that sound movies lost, but it was bought at a heavy price. Silent cinema may have been a universal language, but it was not much more than a pidgin language. Pidgin languages are useful for passing a few simple ideas across a language divide, but they cannot convey the richness of thought that natural languages can.\n\nThe issue here is not that you cannot make great silent films. Clearly you can. People did! It is that most stories don't make good silent films - and those were the stories movie-makers increasingly wanted to tell.\n\nI am belatedly coming to appreciate the considerable achievements of the silent cinema, but I cannot regret its passing.",

The settings and photography are excellent, the acting is generally good, and the story's setup is believable and had possibilities.\n\nThe best part of the movie is the setting on the Isle of Man, which is done very nicely, with well-chosen settings and terrific photography.  The setting is woven into the story very well, and many of the scenes are given backgrounds and props which re-emphasize the distinctive setting and/or give useful symbolism to the events in the plot.  Fishing boats, an old water mill, and the island's rocky beauty are all used effectively.\n\nThe characters are presented well, and you quickly get to know them and sympathize with them.  The first part of the story moves quickly, and efficiently establishes the love-triangle theme.  The three leads (Carl Brisson, Anny Ondra, and Malcolm Keen) are all quite good in this part.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the story is rather a disappointment, moving very slowly at times, and often painful to watch because of some notable flaws in the ways the characters act.  All this really detracts from the continuing good direction and camera work.  There is a very nicely conceived jump cut at one point that could have been very powerful if the story were better, and the climactic sequence does hold some real irony and suspense, but it just doesn't have the impact that it could have had.  Hitchcock does his best with things, but it's too bad that he did not have a freer hand with the material, which was apparently based on a novel that for whatever reason had acquired a certain popularity at the time.\n\nUltimately, this movie is just average.  But there are still some strengths here, and it is probably worth a look for silent film fans who especially appreciate good black-and-white photography, or for devoted Hitchcock fans who will appreciate the touches he added to an otherwise unsatisfying story.\n",

No, the thing that struck me again and again as I watched this sudsy rubbish was the bad casting. The girl, a popular European 27 year old actress of that era, looks (intentionally, I think) like a ditzy 18 year old version of Jean Harlow. 18 may be a good age for a girl in trouble in traditional British lower class society, but it makes it hard to understand why the much older Philip would be in love with her, or why after her girl-in-trouble problem is solved, she would be so much in love with him as to push the love triangle into tragedy. The emotion flow doesn't make sense in either direction.\n\nFor the role of Philip -- good lawyer, unreliable friend and lover -- we see a man clearly in his 40's who looks old enough to be the girl's father. The third node in the triangle is Danish actor Carl Brisson (34 when this was made) , whose most often used talent in this film was his ability to grin glassy eyed into the camera, showing us two enormous dimple lines.\n\nDespite the limitations of the casting and \"Pete's\" acting ability, the performance qualities aren't too bad. For example, when the town doctor comes down to announce the birth of the girl's child, he first asks \"Who's the father?\", as if he was the only person in a small fishing village who wouldn't know. Philip stands up excitedly and is about to claim the honor, but realizes that he can't give himself away, so he makes a small gesture to point at Pete. Nicely handled.\n\nBottom line is that there's very little evidence of Hitchcock's later, more polished style, and not much other reason to rent this movie.",

He tells Philip to look after her while he is gone but Kate and Philip end up falling in love.

The film is based off of a novel and the story is very good and interesting although it seems to follow Hitchcock's typical theme of a love triangle which he has in many of his films.\n\nThe acting in the movie is very good overall with Carl Brisson as Pete. He pulls off happiness, sadness, anger, and concern all very well which is a wide spectrum of emotion for one actor. Malcolm Keen plays Philip who does a less spectacular but still decent job. And then there is Anny Ondra who plays Kate and she does a worthwhile job at showing love for Philip but not for Pete. So while all of the actors do a good job it is really Brisson who steals the show.\n\nAll of the special effects in the film seem pretty good with each of the sets looking nice. The courtroom, dock, house, and just about everything else looks right. And during a drowning scene it also looks pretty real. The musical score is mediocre and feels like it's just a lot of recycled music from earlier Hitchcock films but at least it gets the job done.\n\nOverall this film isn't perfect by any means but it does have a lot of positive qualities which make it worth watching. The plot is really interesting and entertaining if you aren't already sick of Hitchcock's love triangle theme and the acting in the film is overall pretty good.

The story is less than satisfactory since the lawyer gets the girl pregnant at a time when he believed his rival was dead; no one acknowledges this vital extenuating circumstance or explains it to the fisherman in the final denouement.  But what's really disappointing is that the three principals (and the girl's father) are virtually the only roles in the film, and their characters are developed strictly from the necessity of the plot.  There are few Hitchcock touches, either character or visual.  There are no minor characters or bits of business that demonstrate the sharp observation and sly humor that is in just about all of Hitchcock's other films of the period, and it's therefore one of his most impersonal films.",

To financially support the woman he loves, a fisherman travels to Africa, the two promising to remain faithful until he returns. However the fisherman's lawyer friend also loves the woman, and while the fisherman is away, the lawyer and the woman become a couple. When the undead fisherman unexpectedly returns, the woman who promised to remain faithful to him must marry, but is deeply unhappy, as is the lawyer. Being a Hitchcock film, the only surprising thing about this love triangle is that it doesn't end in murder. With a lawyer involved, I guess I should've seen the courtroom finale coming! \n\nThis storyline is all very pointed and obvious, and much of the acting is over the top horrendous. As you would expect however, mostly thanks to noir lighting, Hitchcock does manage to infuse some moodiness and tension and his talent is noticeable - just don't come for the story.",

                "text": "THE MANXMAN\n\nHitchcock's 9th and final silent, THE MANXMAN, is the second film adaptation of a popular novel of the 1890s. Essentially a triangle with best friends in love with the same girl. One goes off to make his fortune, is falsely reported dead, and returns to find his girl in love with his best friend.\n\nThis is a good solid drama, well photographed and edited, very well directed and well acted. There is a minimum use of title cards, as by 1928, the last year of the silent film, the art form had become so visual, explanatory or dialogue cards were rarely needed. The story told itself in the visuals.\n\nThe film was held back a year and released at the end of 1929.\n\nCarl Brisson in one of two films made for Hitchcock (the other THE RING) plays the loving, trusting fisherman, Pete, with more naivete and innocence than sometimes seems possible. As his girlfriend, Kate, Anny Ondra gives a stunning and complex performance. Kate is not nice, but she is able to capture our sympathy with her tortured existence, trying to do \"the right thing\" by keeping her affair secret from her returned husband.\n\nThese two would have been ideal casting in LILIOM, the one as Liliom and the other as Julie.\n\nThe piece of bad casting is that of Malcolm Keen as best friend Philip. He is too old for the part and unattractive. It is inconceivable Kate would choose him over the younger and better looking Pete, even were she trying to marry above her station. The latter motive might have made sense, but there is nothing in the screenplay to denote she is more interested in money than love. She seems genuinely in love with Philip.\n\nThere are the usual fine bits of cinematography and editing we expect to find in a Hitchcock silent: Pete's point of view of his intended in-laws and Philip viewed through the panes of an inner window; Philip's view of Kate and Pete through at a distance through a crowd at the bar; the use of Kate's diary pages flipping to show her increased company with Philip in Pete's absence; a series of beautifully framed shots of Kate and Philip meeting on the beach, using rock sculptures; Kate walking towards us into a close-up of despair at Pete's return; the wedding, using lapse dissolve close-ups of the proceedings; a triptych of Kate and Philip miserably facing the audience at opposite ends of the screen, with an exuberant and clueless Pete in the middle; a lapse dissolve of a table usually set for two now set for one; the dissolve of water just accepting a suicide drowning to the ink, being used for the inquest.\n\nThere's lots to admire in these carefully composed and edited images.\n\nThe impeccable nitrate print on DVD that I viewed is the most pristine of any of the Hitchcock silent films I've viewed to date \u0096 I have one to go \u0096 and came in at a timing of 1:23:30, not the 1:50 on the IMDb web page, nor the \"restored\" 1:41 timing on that page as well.\n\nHighly recommended as a very well done silent drama.",

OR is Kate really just a 'player' (using both men)? It seems to me that Kate is actually in-love with Phil but likes Pete as a good friend - so why did Kate flirt so hard with Pete? Why didn't Kate just tell Pete 'I'm in-love with Phil, and you are our good friend'? \n\nThis whole thing/story happened because Kate flirted hard with both men but really only fell in-love with one man, Phil, and lead Pete on in the very beginning.

And, like most of the Master's silent films, it's decent but not as clever as his later movies. It's a love triangle movie, really, which puts it firmly in the realm of the melodrama and pretty far from scares and chills.\n\nPete (Carl Brisson) is a down-on-his-luck fisherman. He may not pull down a great paycheck, but he does have Kate (Anny Ondra), the beautiful daughter of Pete's landlord, Caesar (Randle Ayrton). Pete and Kate seem to really be into each other, and Pete plans to ask for her hand in marriage by way of her father, whose approval is mandatory. But he can't quite bring himself to ask the old man himself, so he asks his best friend Philip (Malcolm Keen), a lawyer, to speak for him. But Caesar will have none of it, seeking a man of actual means for his daughter, and he kicks Pete out. But that's okay, because Pete plans to sail to \"foreign parts\" and seek his fortune, and then they'll all be sorry! Pete asks Philip to look after Kate while he's gone, and Philip obliges. But soon he and Kate are falling madly in love with each other, which may complicate things when Pete returns. Suddenly - no spoiler! - news arrives that Pete has died while at sea. Now what do Kate and Philip do? They've kept the nature of their relationship a secret so far, but are they now free to bring it out into the open? In addition, Philip is a fast-rising barrister there on the Isle of Man, and he is line to be named the new Deemster (chief judge on the island). Will the revelation derail his career? This is one of those silent films that demands attention really be paid. There are some title cards, but there will be plenty of times when the viewer must make a reasonable inference of the dialog. There are, in fact, two scenes in which someone mouths something that isn't noted at all in a title card - and each instance is quite important to the plot. One must deduce their nature by checking the reaction of the other characters in the scene.\n\nThe Manxman (i.e., man from the Isle of Man) does feature three fine performances and is a solid representation of films of the era. There are some plot twists, although modern viewers may be able to spot them well before they make their appearance in this movie.",

Hall Caine was a flowery Victorian writer whose reputation didn't survive his death. In his day he was a best selling author and crowds often gathered outside his house - he was given the adulation now reserved for movie stars. He tried to resume his writing after the War but now people found his writing old fashioned, he hadn't kept abreast of the times and never regained his popularity. He did put the Isle of Man on the map as most of his books were set there and quite a few of his most popular (\"The Christian\", \"The Woman Thou Gavest Me\") were turned into silent films. Alfred Hitchcock turned to \"The Manxman\" for his last silent film. He had intended filming it on the Isle of Man but after shooting a few initial scenes found he could not get on with Hall Caine so ended by filming entirely on location in Cornwall, which, to me, was a huge plus.\n\nThis is a lengthy romantic melodrama involving the \"eternal triangle\". Peter (Carl Brisson) and Philip (Malcolm Keen) are both in love with the same girl, Kate (vivacious Onny Andra) who is a little flirt and can't make her eyes behave. Kate's father, who is the only villain, worships money and despises Pete, who is only a fisherman and calls him a penniless lout. He is far keener on Philip and encourages their romance, and Pete makes the fatal mistake of encouraging Philip to look after her when he sails off to seek his fortune. Philip, soon to be made a Deemster (judge) looks after her too well but then starts to have second thoughts about becoming involved with a publican's daughter. His own father is constantly held up to him as what can happen when a man of position marries beneath him. \n\nSuddenly Pete comes home very wealthy (he had been reported as dead) and is now \"flavour of the month\" as far as Kate's father is concerned. But even though they marry, Kate is nursing a secret that is only revealed when she is bought to court after a suicide attempt and finds Philip is the presiding judge. SPOILER ALERT.... It all ends pretty miserably. Peter is left heartbroken and alone while Kate and Philip leave the village amid name calling and clenched fists, knowing they will never be able to return and Philip's once bright future is in the dust.\n\nYears ago, reading Greta Garbo's biography, it seemed that Carl Brisson was her first big crush. He had been a Swedish matin\u00e9e idol of the stage so it was surprising for me to learn that his film career was so sparse. In fact he was noted more for his career as a boxer which first bought him to Hitchcock's attention when he was casting \"The Ring\". Also look out for Derrick De Marney, who was later one of the stars of Hitchcock's \"Young and Innocent\", as an extra in the wedding scene.",

For those of us on this side of the pond who don't know, a Manxman is one who is a resident of the Isle of Man where the main industry is commercial fishing.\n\nThis was Alfred Hitchcock's last silent feature and it's a triangle story about Philip and Peter and the girl they're both crazy about Anny Ondryx. Philip wanted to make something of himself so he studied hard and became a lawyer. Peter was content to be a fisherman, but when Anny's father says that no daughter of his is going to marry some guy with no prospects that she rates better, Peter leaves the Isle of Man to seek fame and fortune and leaves Philip to Anny. \n\nShe's been kanoodling with both of them, but it's Philip's child she's bearing. But it's Peter she's marrying. Peter is played by Danish film star Carl Brisson and Philip is portrayed by Malcolm Keen. Although the film doesn't have the tragic end of The Scarlet Letter, Keen does a Reverend Dimmesdale like mea culpa as the climax.\n\nSome of the scenes of the Isle of Man were quite nicely photographed and I'm told not much has changed in the over 80 years since The Manxman came out.

There were some slow dissolves as well to signify the passage of time which were handled quite adeptly. The use of the boats and the hills were strategically interspersed and quite lovely. There was an important clue near the beginning of the film when Philip's aunt warns him that his father married below his rank and suffered all his life. We are led to believe that Philip will suffer a similar fate. It is a story of two men's lives and their friendship destroyed by a woman who simply refuses to accept any sort of responsibility.

As with Hitchcock's other entries in this genre, this film offers up some nice technical stuff but the director just can't handle the melodrama too well. There are some beautiful sequences here including one where Pete asks Philip to talk to the girl's father while he waits outside. Hitchcock shows up this scene from the point of view of Pete who is outside looking in through a window. This scene works very well as does one showing Kate after she receives word that he has been killed.

(that also contains the fun,haunted-house style sound film Number Seventeen )Checking the collection ,I was very happy to discover a selection of Hitchcocks silent films in the set,looking at the films,I decided that I would pick this film as the first silent film that I would ever watch.\n\nThe plot:\n\nOn a small island called the Isle of Man,an unlikely friendship is struck between a poor fisherman named Pete,and a budding lawyer called Philip.The friendship is built on trust and loyalty,with Pete being impressed that Philip is the only lawyer on the island who defends the rights and working conditions of the fishermen,and Philip having a deep respect for the intense amount of hours that Pete spends doing a very tough job.On a night night out,Pete falls in love,at the very first sight of a girl called Kate.Pushing Philip to ask Kate's father if Pete can take his daughters hand in marriage,Pete is left with a huge amount of disappointment and anger,when the Kate's father tells Philip that he will never let his best friend marry his daughter,due to him being \"not worthy\" and too low down on the food chain.Infuriated by her dad's response,Pete announces that he is going to go on a trip to Africia right away,so that he can come back wealthy,and at last get Kate's hand in marriage.Just before he leaves,Pete makes sure to tell Philip to look after Kate,whilst he is away.Agreeing to this,Philip and Kate start to become great friends,with Kate's sense of anticipation for Pete's return,increasing day by day.Suddenly,Philip and Kate's lives start to spiral out of control when news reaches them that Philip has died.Attempting to comfort her,Philp's and Kate's friendship gradually begins to develop in to a much more romantic one,to the point where they have both settled down together,and have had a baby.Early one morning,whilst Kate is on her own feeding the baby,the front door to the house suddenly opens,and Pete suddenly appears!.Whilst She tries to make sense of what is happening,Pete tells Kate that he has spoken to her father,and he has at last agreed to the marriage.Looking around the room,Pete is filled with joy to see that she has had a baby,due to him thinking that he must have gotten Kate pregnant just before he left..\n\nView on the film:\n\nThe first people that I feel deserve a huge amount of praise for the film,is the DVD company Canal+,who have taken this great film out of it's worn out Public Domain past,and have now given it a new coat of paint,with the image being surprisingly very clean,and the new piano music score being able to brilliantly give more depth to the dramatic moments,as well as making the early,light-hearted moments much more playful.Looking at the cast,Malcolm Keen gives a brilliant performance as Philip Christan,who although oddly giving a strong vibe that he might be about to star in Unerversal Studio's next monster horror movie,Keen is still able to cleverly show Christan's change,from someone who is willing to do as much as possible for everyone,to a person who tries to keep to himself as much as possible to himself,whilst always making sure that he never let's the character completely fall into the shadows of darkness For what would turn out to be his last ever silent film,Hitchcock show's a huge bundle of creative idea's that he would continue to use and expand upon,for the rest of his legendary career.One of the main things,that makes this a key piece of his film career,is Hitchcock making Anny Ondra (Kate Cregeen) his first Blonde leading lady,although here,he interestingly gives the character a very noticeable wide-eyed innocent side,whilst letting the icy side of Kate ,only be shown as the film reaches its ending.Along with the creation of the Hitchcock Blonde,Hitchcock shows strong hints in his great directing for this film, of some moments that would be reused and expanded upon in the future,with a sequence which involves a character attempting to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff,being something that he would return to for his classic film Vertigo,although in this case,he chooses to end the scene with a startling fade-out,which helps to give the scene a very haunting feel,as well as showing that the film is now going into a much more bleak direction.\n\nFinal view on the film:\n\nFor his last ever silent film,Hitchcock leaves the era with style,by making a very entertaining drama,that also has him showing some of his main idea's and themes that he would expand and build upon for the rest of his astonishing career.",

Here's proof of the concept in action long before Ebert came along to christen it.\n\nBosom buddies Pete (Carl Brisson) and Philip (Malcolm Keen) follow different career paths on the Isle of Man; Pete fishes and Philip practices law. Pete falls in love with the barkeeper's daughter, pretty Kate (Anny Ondra) and asks Philip to look after her while he goes off to make his fortune. Philip looks after her alright, enough to be worried at news of Pete's return.\n\nThe idiot plot, in this instance, is the fact that Pete and Kate aren't exactly lovers even before he leaves; director Alfred Hitchcock clues us in early to the fact Kate wants Philip and vice versa. Why then the hang-up about her pairing off with Philip? Philip himself says something about Pete's \"faith in our loyalty,\" but it seems a thin idea to build a story around.\n\nAn idiot plot alone isn't enough to condemn a film; looked at rationally it could be said \"The Searchers\" and Hitchcock's own \"Vertigo\" have them, too, and I think they're swell anyway. Here, however, the idiot plot is in service of a slow-moving film rife with unintentional comedy and two performances (Keen's and Ondra's) which are cringingly bad. You can't help noticing the characters acting stupidly when there's nothing much of quality to distract you.\n\nThe only arresting element to this whole film, other than the fact it represents Hitchcock's final silent feature (he made some good ones, but really needed sound to find himself), is the cinematography by Jack E. Cox, which calls attention to itself from the opening shot of fishing boats sailing into port amid a strikingly craggy shoreline. Each outdoor shot grants you a new perspective at this offbeat location from this distant time.\n\nWhenever this film is inside, it is a real tooth-pull. Hitchcock favors long shots of the actors staring into the camera, eyes darting back and forth to indicate hidden secrets. Kate flounces about in a state of perpetual minxhood, seemingly unable to control her desire for Phil even if it means abandoning her baby to set up residency in Phil's closet. Phil could have been interesting if he was played as a bit of a louse, but instead Keen gives us a series of pained looks to indicate how aggrieved he is by the whole thing. He looks instead like a used-car salesman.\n\nThere's a funny moment where Phil and Kate first get it on inside a mill, in which the camera decorously cuts to a grinding millstone after they embrace. Hello, train tunnel. But it gets rather ridiculous when Kate and Pete hold their reception in the same room, and Kate's Bible- thumping Dad somehow decides to use that same grindstone as an object lesson against backsliding and adultery.\n\n\"The mills of God grind slowly...\" he warns, as Kate and Phil shrink in fear.\n\nThe mills of Hitch grind slowly indeed in this film, all because Phil is too much of an idiot to tell his buddy the truth.

                "text": "The \"Manxman\" in the title refers to a person from the Isle of Man--an independent part of the British Crown but technically not part of the United Kingdom. This large island is located between Britain and Ireland and actually produces its own money and has its own particular language (though English is commonly spoken). Outside the UK, I doubt if that man people are familiar with this place or would recognize the three-legged symbol (the \"triskelion\") on its flag. Just a bit of history to put the whole thing in perspective. Plus, it's the only film I can recall having seen that's set on this island.\n\nThe film begins with two friends living on the island. Pete is a poor fisherman and Philip is from a well to do family. They both are in love with the same girl, though because Philip is such a nice guy, he stands aside and says nothing. However, the girl's father won't have Pete for a son-in-law because he's so poor, so Philip goes off to sea to earn his fortune. Unfortunately, word soon comes to everything that Pete has died, so Philip announces to the girl that he loves her. Coincidentally, it turns out she always loved Philip as well, so they plan on marrying. Then, out of the blue, Pete returns--he didn't die while at sea after all. The first thing he does is ask the girl again to be his bride. Heartbroken but feeling responsible since Pete asked her first, she agrees. Unfortunately, unknown to her and Philip is that she is carrying Philip's baby!! Yikes.\n\nWell, after the baby is born, apparently Pete couldn't figure out that the kid was his and Philip moves to England to start life anew. However, soon she follows him--leaving poor Pete stuck at home with the kid. What a mess, but in spite of this Pete keeps up a brave face and tells everyone she's on holiday. Later, he comes to see Philip to ask him to help find his wife--little did he know that she was with his best friend all along.\n\nIf you think about it, this plot is very much like a soap opera and is nothing like the films for which Hitchcock became well-known. As far as the film goes, it is pretty interesting but the plot suffers from one problem. When Pete returned from sea, had they just told him the truth--that they fell in love AFTER they heard he was dead--then the whole mess could have been avoided. Sure, Pete would have been upset but would have no doubt understood. However, aside from this obvious solution, it's a pretty interesting film and is well made, though a tad predictable. As far as the acting goes, it's pretty good for a silent--without an serious over-emoting.\n\nBy the way, Hitchcock's next film (also 1929) turned out to be Britain's first sound film. While this was well behind the US move to sound, it was still early compared to the rest of the world.",

                "text": "Here, the director seems to be in search of a style. What we see of this love triangle on the Isle of Mann, involving an honest fisherman, his gorgeous wife, and his principled but weak friend, is all overacting. The conventions of silents like this must have been imported from the stage though, to be sure, Hitchcock's grounding was in film from the beginning.\n\nStill it's distracting to see the characters over-do every expression and gesture, as if making sure that no one in the rear of the theater misses the reactions of the live people on stage.\n\nPete Quilliam (Carl Brisson) is the fisherman who loves the daughter (Anny Ondra) of the dour pub owner. Anny is flirtatious but uncertain. Pete wants to marry her but her father objects that Pete is too poor to be a husband. Off sails Pete to Africa to make his fortune, or his misfortune if it comes to that. He leaves Anny's welfare in the hands of his best friend, Phillip Christian (Malcolm Keen), which is always a mistake.\n\nDuring honest Pete's absence, Anny and Phillip fall in love, and when they receive a telegram saying that Pete has met his demise, they are free to marry. But they've kept their love a secret, partly because Phillip is ashamed and partly because he is in line for a judgeship, and the outcome of that election might get a little problematic if he were mixed up with a mere barmaid. Meanwhile, nothing prevents Anny and Phillip from doing the horizontal mambo in out-of-the-way places.\n\nBut -- surprise! Pete isn't dead at all! He debarks from his ship, rich, ebullient, but dumb. Anny marries him out of a sense of obligation while Mr. Christian sulks in the background, carrying his burden of guilt. Anny gives birth to Phillip's child and Pete exults, \"I'm a father!\" (Still as dumb as ever.) Then things get twisted. Phillip becomes the judge his family wanted him to be, Anny tries to commit suicide, and Pete finally wises up. Phillip resigns. He, Anny, and their child, march off bravely into the sunset, scorned by the villagers but determined to start anew -- somehow.\n\nAs distracting as the overblown acting is, I forgive Anny Ondra because, let's face it, I'm a latent heterosexual. My God, she's cute. A tiny blue-eyed blond with winsome features, narrow shoulders, and gracile form. Any normal man would want to squeeze and bite her.\n\nIt's Malcolm Keen's duty, as Phillip Christian, to look glum and contrite. As Pete, Carl Brisson acts as if he needs a clinical dose of lithium. His eyes bulge with effervescence and his smile is like that of a chimpanzee with its lips pulled back in that sly way that chimps have.\n\nAnd when you come right down to it, it's mostly Anny's fault. After all, as a flighty young girl, she flightily gave her word to Pete that she would remain faithful to him. And she was morally loose with Mr. Christian the moment Pete's ship was hull down on the horizon. Then she allowed good old Pete to think the baby was his. And instead of resigning herself to a career as a dutiful wife in marriage to a man she liked but didn't love, she has to leave the baby, take off, live in Phillip's closet for a week or so, and then jump in the harbor. She thinks of nobody but herself. Yet, again, I forgive her.\n\nThe two guys are no paragons either. Pete belongs in a home for the criminally naive, and Phillip should have sentenced himself to one week in the Hudson County Jail in Jersey City. That would have taken some of the starch out of him.\n\nIt's not a bad film, just rather ordinary. Hitchcock had yet to find his m\u00e9tier, and this isn't it.",

Yet fifteen minutes later she's standing in a slip while brushing her hair, and her nipples are clearly outlined through the fabric. Shocking, I tell you! My favorite scene was the dance sequence, which features a wonderful, haunting piece of music called \"Blue Is The Night\" by Fred Fisher.\n\nOverall this movie was interesting as an exercise in contrast and comparison with modern films.

The movie opens with a crucial event: Henry Marlett (Lewis Stone) is leaving the family in a shocking way \u0096 he is divorcing his current wife (Belle Bennett) for another lady, a Ms. Beth Cheever (Helen Millard). Norma Shearer plays the temperamental daughter Lucia \"Lally\" who can't stand to see her family be separated by this occurrence and grows estranged from him. She soon after meets and falls in love with a young man, played by Robert Montgomery, who happens to be Ms.Cheever's son. Mrs. Marlett of course is outraged at their relationship and teeters on suicide which temporarily separates Jack from Lally, but not for long: they do meet one night in what seems to be a clandestine elopement, and are caught in a raging storm. To the world they have drowned, but her father rushes to find them and bring them back to safety. The film ends as Lally and Jack are back together again.\n\nShearer and Montgomery work well as a romantic couple and would be re-teamed again on two occasions, on PRIVATE LIVES from 1931 and RIPTIDE, from 1934. Here, though, both display a frank youthfulness to their interpretation \u0096 they could easily pass for nineteen, which is what their characters portray. Shearer especially is good in her scenes and doesn't totally resort to the posturing that was common of the actors making the transition from silent to talkies, although the moving scene as she wavers in and out of consciousness after the storm, cradling Montgomery's head and half-praying has a silent film quality which regardless, holds well. As does the lovely moment when Shearer and Stone reconcile \u0096 there is a genuine, emotional moment that without too much exposition neatly ties the story at its conclusion.\n\nTHEIR OWN DESIRE has a clunky quality that comes from the type of transition from scene to scene and its script implies more than it states, but nevertheless this is a good movie to sit back and enjoy for a little more than an hour and watch the rising leads play exuberant, privileged young things from the Roaring Twenties.",

The dialogue seems unusually terse by 1929 standards - much is left unsaid, and the film is better because of it. Shearer is quite good; she carries the film with apparent ease.

Robert Montgomery, one of the few actors not moving from silence to sound but still new to films is awkward and fond of practically being on top of the other person in his scenes. To be fair this might have been a requirement of the new technology, and it is better than talking into a flower pot, but he seems more reliant on it than the other actors. He would improve vastly within a short period of time but here comes across as a callow youth.

If you were a woman, you'd just better hope that as the bloom fell off of your rose that your husband did not get the 7, 17, or 27 year itch. This is about the impact of one of those marriages with an itchy husband, an unlikely cad, Lewis Stone as Marlett.\n\nI like how this movie takes the time to build up the characters, always a trademark of screenwriter Frances Marion. A great deal of time is spent in the beginning to show the respect and friendship wealthy author Marlett has with his only child, Lally (Norma Shearer). Then a tell - she asks her dad as they walk up the drive, what book he is working on. He says it is a romance involving a 45 year old man. She, about 20, laughs at the idea. Marlett says that the middle aged are made of flesh and bone too. That life is not over at 30 as youngsters think, and that they thirst for romance, that \"last\" romance, indicating that dad might be thirsty. When they get to the top of the drive, the slender and glamorous Mrs. Chevers is talking to Lally's mom about her son, Doug, who is away at Princeton. Lally's mom is graying, a bit overweight, a bit sedentary, and Marlett calls her affectionately \"mama\". Indicating that he thinks of her as first Lally's mom - and a good one - and then a wife.\n\nA year passes and Marlett and his wife are planning to divorce, as is Mrs. Chevers from her husband, but Lally yet knows none of this. She walks into her dad's study and catches Mrs. Chevers and her father in a passionate embrace, talking of marriage. Then her dad tries to justify it. He says that he and her mother are not the same boy and girl who made all of those promises 23 years before. I like Lally's translations - that perhaps he sees her mom as fat and a bit boring \"unlike the slick Mrs. Chevers\". He says he intends to keep the house. She reminds him that doesn't matter to her since her mom is being bundled out of that house and Mrs. Cheever is being brought in to replace her. Lally says her final goodbye to him and plans to never marry because she will not be made a fool of as her mother has been, and the male sex has fallen mightily in her esteem because of her father's fall, which he won't even acknowledge as a misdeed.\n\nSo off go mother and daughter for a summer vacation before mom goes to France for a divorce, which was the custom in that day. When Lally reiterates her vow to never marry, her mom is happy, which seems odd. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Marlett is not succeeding at hanging out at his old haunts with his new mistress. They both get the cold shoulder from everyone. I'm not sure why this scene was in here other than to show that people did pass moral judgment on affairs and homewreckers at that time, and that a smooth transition did not await them both if they proceed.\n\nOn vacation, Lally meets a guy (Robert Montgomery) who really fancies her. They dance, they enjoy each other's company, and maybe Lally is softening on men just a bit until she discovers his full name - Jack \"Doug\" Chevers - son of the woman who has ousted her mother, a symbol of why she decided to not take men seriously in the first place.\n\nSo Lally is one confused girl. She has a mom who encourages her to play the field due to her own bad experience with marriage. She has a dad who thinks \"until death do we part\" is just a phrase people like to kick around at weddings, and she has a beau who is insisting on marriage now - as in right this minute. How will this all work out? Watch and find out.\n\nThis is very good writing by Frances Marion who had already had a couple of short lived marriages that did not work out and one that did that ended in her husband's sudden death just the year before. Thus she could approach this subject of love from the viewpoint of someone who had seen all of the angles. I'd highly recommend it.",

She's the epitome of the 1920's flapper \u0096 playful, adventurous, and in control of her own destiny. She's also smart, sexy in a natural way, and has an infectious laugh \u0096 truly a delight to watch. She plays the spunky daughter of a couple who divorce, and later finds herself unknowingly falling in love with Robert Montgomery, the son of her father's new wife, setting up inner conflict. I love how we see her character playing polo, diving from a high board, and canoeing in a storm \u0096 and also how we see her romantic, and in control of how far she wants to take things. She occasionally overacts but is so natural and spontaneous otherwise that I'm not surprised she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance.",

This is pretty good drama that manages to have some very good scenes but also some very bad scenes. It's really strange but everything in this movie is either very good or very bad and that's everything from the performances to the story to the direction. The story is an interesting one but everything to do with Shearers mother is poorly written. We're suppose to feel sorry for her mother but the way her role is written we actually start to hate her because she causes so much trouble for her daughter that we can't stand her. The ending also doesn't work because it's so over the top in a bad way but this is after a terrific scene where Shearer and Montgomery get caught in a storm. Shearers performance is also very hit and miss as at times she's very good but at other times she brings laughter, which certainly wasn't intended. Just take a look at the scene where her father admits that he's divorcing her mother. Shearer's acting here is so silly that I couldn't keep a straight face. Montgomery is also very over the top but it's a fun performance. Stone, once again, is hit and miss but for the most part he works fine. The sound quality of the Vitophone track is very good.",

Although Lally longs to reach out for personal happiness and to marry Jack (Robert Montgomery), she struggles to overcome her mother's indoctrination against marriage, which is based upon the failure of her own union.\n\nEditing is choppy in \"Their Own Desire\" and the photography provides little beauty that might reflect the love between Lally and Jack. Stronger is the insidious, unhealthy devotion of Lally to her mother.\n\nThe ending feels false and simplistic, with no real resolution of the conflict. Still, Norma Shearer acquits herself well, showing a range of emotions.",

I'm not a big feminist (is any male, really?), but I was grinding my teeth whenever the question, \"Oh, Darling, won't you be mine?\" was asked. Today, it's a quaint notion, but at that time, the idea that a man could own a woman was accepted without any raised eyebrows. I found the love affair between the two leads simply not credible; it had no traction. One couldn't imagine happening today what the Shearer character decides with respect to her new lover -- and we're seemingly so much more sophisticated these days. Ah, 'tis a queer, ironic world. A technical note: If the couple was on Lake Michigan when the storm blew up, somebody needed to tell the author that there just ain't that many islands in the lake, and none within an easy row or swim. A little reminiscent of Puccini's opera \"Manon Lescaut,\" the final scene of which takes place in the \"Louisiana desert.\"",

If you've ever seen a Leon Errol short, you've seen the various complications that happen here, although it's nice to see them in a silent context: the neighbor's spouse locked out in the hall, the guy caught in the neighbor's apartment in his bathrobe or something who has to hide in the closet, the lingerie delivered to the wrong address, etc. etc. Classic comic situations like these never date, and with pros such as Billy Bevan (he of the walrus mustache) and Vernon Dent (who had a great comic pairing with Monte Collins at this time, and who is best known for his work with the Three Stooges), the comedy never lets up, and director Phil Whitman keeps the pace steady. Interestingly, the title card says that this short is part of a \"tired businessman's series.\" Since we never really get into the exact jobs of these two men, are the tired businessmen the ones who are in the audience WATCHING this film? Well, I can't ask Mack Sennett, can I? Overall, this is a very good late-silent comedy short featuring two men who I never tire of watching (and also fine support from Natalie Joyce and Anna Ward as the respective spouses--whichever lady plays Dent's wife is quite sexy and seductive!).",

Thanks to their hard work, it is now easy to understand the story (though the music they added left something to be desired--\"Flight of the Bumblebees\" is not appropriate for a seduction scene).\n\nIf you've always wanted to see Charles Farrell without his shirt on (and who hasn't?), this is the movie for you. I agree with the other reviewers that the film contains a strong erotic charge. The stunning camera-work and lighting, the world-weary, Dietrichesque beauty of Mary Duncan (intriguingly out of place in the hardscrabble setting), and the always-gorgeous Farrell combine to fashion a moody, seductive world. But most of my fellow audience members were unable to give themselves over to the melodrama, and could only laugh at the plot and complain afterward, which was very annoying to us romantics in the audience.\n\nIn addition to Charles and Mary, the remaining footage contains pieces of Ivan Linow's sympathetic portrayal of \"a deaf-mute giant\". You will also see a trained pet crow with a lot of personality, and a dead bear whose presence is unwittingly tragic.",

And yet... miraculously, the scenes preserved are (probably, one has to be cautious) the highlights of the films, the moments which Frank Borzage has taken special care to shoot, and probably those which really interested him: the conscious, blatant seduction of Allen John by Rosalee, her resorting to her own sex appeal to convince him to sleep with her(Put your hand on my heart, Allen John); the meeting between a brooding Rosalee and a naked, swimming Allen John, foreshadowing the much-commented-upon climax of the present version: Rosalee saves Allen John from freezing to death by offering him her warmth: she covers his naked body with her(silk-gowned) shapes, and revives him instantly. Funnily, this sequence has always been the basis for fantasy on the part of French historians after George Sadoul, who saw it in 1929, reported that Mary Duncan was naked. Contrary to other classics from Borzage's late 20s Fox period, this does not feature Janet Gaynor, but the duet Farrell/Duncan: hence a more frankly sensual relationship, which the short version emphasizes by actually eliminating all the other aspects of the plot. Borzage uses Duncan very effectively, by stressing the contrast between her experienced personality and the more childish, naive enthusiasm of Charles Farrell's Allen John. The moment when Rosalee welcomes him home in a winter night, only to find him taking a board game and proposing \"entertainment\", and the ensuing gesture of Rosalee, sweeping of the board with her hand clearly expecting Allen John to invite her to more entertaining situations, could have been plain ridiculous; but the frank gaze of the actress, the way she lets herself go on the bed, and the sudden realization by Farrell of the situation he is in(He trembles, mouth open , eyes fixed on the woman in front of him; What can he do? What is she doing? Farrell is brilliant here.), all make for a very memorable scene. As usual with Frank Borzage, once they have been together for a few days, a man and a woman actually discover how attracted to each other they've grown. The sensual, or sexual tension is part of Borzage's treatment of a love affair, one that goes beyond reason. But here, contrary to Seventh Heaven or A Man's Castle, the woman leads, with authority. Duncan was the antithesis of Gaynor in that matter. So, until we discover more from this film, with or without sound(It was issued as a part-talkie. None of the sound scenes survive.), this almost entirely satisfactory sketch of seduction by the man who gave us Seventh Heaven, Lucky Star or The Mortal storm is worth unlimited, repeated viewing.",

Importantly, the surviving footage pretty much depicts in its entirety the romance of Allen John (Charles Farrell) and Rosalee (Mary Duncan), which is the backbone of the story.\n\nI originally heard 'The River' described as the most erotic film of the silent era, so I naturally said to myself, \"that piece of information has absolutely no bearing on my interest in this film.\" In fact, it isn't as described (something like 'Erotikon (1929)' would probably be closer to the mark), though leading actress Mary Duncan certainly does sultry very well. Farrell's traditional co-star was Janet Gaynor, but I can see why the switch was made here. Gaynor was always the epitome of feminine innocence and fragility; this role requires an actress with a hard crust, someone along the lines of Marlene Dietrich.\n\nMost of 'The River' unfolds in an isolated valley, where the construction of a dam has been temporarily postponed. All the workers leave for the winter, except for Rosalee, whose boyfriend has been arrested for murder, and Allen John, who misses the last train because he keeps getting distracted by the womanly presence. The small cast, and confined surroundings, thus breed an element of intimacy (though I can't recall so much as a kiss between the two lovers).

The River is an usual testosterone-filled romance with boyish Charles Farrell trying to romance woman of the world Mary Duncan.

In the way of romance is an ex-con named Marsdon. The film has been reconstructed using the script along with stills in key spots where actual footage is lost; will the footage ever be found? Who can say? Farrell plays it rugged and Duncan plays the unusual (for the time) role of leading the romance ahead. Director Borzage uses the motif of firewood to stir the embers of romance. Without the missing scenes, the film possibly becomes more erotic than intended. The regretful Mary Duncan in one scene lies on top of Farrell to transfer her much needed body warmth to him.

                "text": "An impressive film, but obviously it was cursed from the beginning: it was planned(1927) as a rival production of Dreyer's masterpiece, but due to delays and to the fact that such a shooting could only take a huge amount of time and money, allowing many of its stars(Philippe H\u00e9riat or Gaston Modot, for instance) to fool around with other productions in between takes and shooting days, it was only released after the Passion, in late 1928. The result is of course that not only Dreyer's film was chronologically first, but today it is also generally regarded as the best of both Joan Of Arc movies from late 20s France. De Gastyne's film also suffered from the crisis in the French Cinema of the late twenties, in France,which would prove problematic for Feyder, Gance, Renoir, L'Herbier, and even Dreyer's Joan! This epic, however, is a surprise; Simone Genevois is not Falconetti, but she brings to the role the necessary kindness and the soft determination of young Joan. The settings and the general historical feeling are quite convincing as well, and this is in large part due to the skill of the actors. Like Fairbanks or Chaney, Modot, H\u00e9riat have faces and bodies that make them look good in a borrowed costume; they look authentic, and the same could be said about the settings, never expressionistic or suggested, on the contrary of Dreyer's film, they contribute to giving a nice period feel. The restoration, by Ren\u00e9e Lichtig, was made from various prints, including 9.5mm material, that could have been provided by Kevin Brownlow; given that the latter has always been rather enthusiastic about the film, I think he would certainly have agreed to contribute on such a project.

Jeanne's entire biography, from devout farm girl to agent of God to her capture and execution by the English, is perhaps too long and complex to be contained in a single two-hour feature, and as a result the film tends to resemble a thumbnail sketch of highlights, skimming briskly over long periods of Joan's life with the help of lengthy title cards.

A detective friend of the dead man trails Alice, however, and reveals her past to the elder Blaine, who denounces her and offers her money to leave town. Alice not only refuses but accuses Blaine of robbing his own bank. In the resulting scuffle both the banker and the detective are killed, and Alice is free to marry Jerry.

To study their films from the dawn of sound to the birth of the production code is to study America's descent into the Great Depression from the height of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nThis little film sits at that crossroads, and it is the kind of wacky little film that Warners would not have tried a year later, once they began to come up with their own distinctive look and feel, but at this point they are still groping for a formula that works. The movie is about average working people who fill their nights with dance contests at the local dance club, Hoffman's Parisian Dance Palace. The patrons may be working stiffs during the day, but at night they have a chance at the limelight and a trophy commemorating their dancing skill. Enter Bill Cleaver (Grant Withers), a soda jerk by day who still lives with his disapproving parents and who lives for these contests. His regular dance partner is Jazzbo Gans. She's not really his type, but they win contests together, although she aspires for the relationship to be something more. Bill's chief competitor and nemesis is Needles Thompson. Needles claims he has a secret weapon - a new dance partner. Bill gets a look at this new partner, Molly O'Neil, and it's lust, or at least fascination, at first sight. He plays a trick on Needles to divert his attention and starts dancing with Molly. The two win the contest that night, and sit down to talk.\n\nMeanwhile, the dance club had been promoting that there was going to be a marriage performed live at the club that night. Unfortunately, the couple calls it quits and Jerry Browne, Hoffman's Parisian Dance Palace Manager, is told he'll be fired if he doesn't come up with a substitute couple. He plays upon the romantic moment between Bill and Molly - and the free furniture doesn't hurt either - and the couple does the deed, mainly looking for a way out from under their parents. Both sets of parents react badly to the news, and pretty soon the couple is having problems themselves. It's hard to make a marriage work based on a mutual love of dancing, especially if marital responsibilities keep you from doing even that.\n\nThis film features a cast that can only rarely be spotted in supporting roles - if at all - just a year later. Grant Withers, who was a early talkie Warners leading man experiment that failed, is very likable here. The smart cracks fit the character he's playing here just perfectly. Sid Silvers is well cast as the dance club manager. This film has two scenes that really are worth watching just for the dance steps. First, the introduction to the film has a couple dancing wildly and it is really a sight to behold. The second scene that is very interesting is about at the film's half-way point. The dance club patrons are all dancing a new step - \"The Hullabaloo\" - and it has to be seen to believed. The atmosphere, the wise-cracks, the strange choice of subject matter, the demonstration of dancing as it was practiced at the conclusion of the roaring 20's, and even the hummable little waltz tune that back-scores the second half of the film as Bill and Molly's love song make this obscure little film worth your time especially for the early talkie fan and film history buff.",

While I don't quite think she had a place at the top, Sue was just one of many bubbly actresses who's career seemed to be over after the first rush of early musicals. She and her frequent co-star Nick Stuart married and that may have led to Fox's (her initial studio) lack of interest - she wasn't even given a part in their big all star extravaganza \"Happy Days\". But as \"Dancing Sweeties\" showed she was very cute and personable and could have had a much larger career if she had cared to, instead of opting for married life.\n\nHer co-star was Grant Withers who, in 1930, was Warner's best bet for male stardom but, unfortunately, along came James Cagney who garnered all the attention in the two films they both appeared in - \"Sinner's Holiday\" and \"Other Men's Women\". By the end of the decade he had settled down to action programmers but in 1930 he was still bubbly and enthusiastic and his role as Bill Cleaver, the egotistical dancer in \"Dancing Sweeties\", might just be his best role.\n\nThe film gets off to an exciting and innovative start with a pair of professional dancers giving a display of a tap dancing charleston (even though only their legs are shown at first, it is definitely not Sue or Grant). Instantly after, predictability sets in - but who cares!!! Bill \"Kid\" Cleaver is a cocky dancer who is convinced he will win his 9th dancing cup with \"Jazzbo\" (Edna Murphy) but when he spies cute Molly O'Neil (Carol) he thinks nothing of pinching her for the dancing contest (she came with a partner called \"Needles\"). To the strain of the haunting \"The Kiss Waltz\" they win - he finds her a cute kid, she thinks he is conceited \"No I'm not - but I have every reason to be\"!! The dance hall also performs \"public weddings\" - \"you furnish the girl, we furnish the apartment\", but when the couple about to be married have a row (\"I just found out he's an undertaker\") in no time at all Bill and Molly are persuaded to tie the knot!! Both of them are having parent problems - their families don't think they are responsible or grown up enough and they want to prove that they are.\n\nMarried life doesn't prove blissful, there are visits from Molly's free loading family and by the time they finally get to a dance contest, \"Needles\" is now the number one dancer. When Molly can't master the steps of the complicated \"Hullabaloo\" Bill's ego takes over and they have their first fight, he can't leave his dance hall days behind but Molly is keen to settle down. They drift apart and only then does Bill realise what he has lost.\n\nBoth the leads brought a lot of conviction to their roles - more than the paper thin plot deserved. The movie is more famous today for what wasn't in it. The song \"I'm Dancing With Tears in My Eyes\" was removed from the final print because the front office didn't think it was good enough - it went on to be one of the hits of the year and proved a big seller for Ruth Etting.",

All the things we are surrounded by seem as natural as sunlight and the only way they could be. But we live in a world where the stilted possibilities so outweigh the lucky happenstance that it is amazing we can stand it.\n\nMovies are a small cosmos we create as our own gods and they behave the same way. So what we watch and how our visual imagination works is largely accidental. You can see some of the broken paths in old films. These reflect the \"what might have beens\" of the real world and are the real nodes of extinct possibilities in movies.\n\nAnd when it is a dance movie, so much the better, because film and dance have been on- again off-again sweethearts from the beginning to now. And perhaps no romance in film has been more passionate but constrained than this.\n\nNow. This movie, a vitaphone from the first real year of talkies is an interesting find. The story is simple and staged as a play except for the dance scenes. That story would be unacceptably simple and direct today: a guy is a dancing fool who cannot live without spending nights at the local dance hall competing. The text after the title sequence assures us that such passionate folk exist.\n\nThe girl is a simple, ordinary type, interested in building a home and family. By the thinnest of devices, they meet, marry and events transpire as expected. (Dance loses, family wins.)\n\nAnd that's what happens in the movie proper. Dance is left by the wayside. In fact, except for the title sequence and a bit in the middle where our players watch a Charleston-type group, the dance is a matter of talking about it and some amazingly ungraceful boxstep.\n\nWhat prompted me to this was seeing \"Take the Lead,\" the newest dance movie as I write this. In a way, these are two ends of two family trees that still hasn't found the perfect mating.\n\nSigh.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

He actually enters from behind a curtain out of character to introduce himself, explain his outrageous accent and set up the plot. The New York Times said, `He is the whole show, and when he is off screen the suspense consists of waiting until he reappears, either to sing or talk in his charming manner.' The plot concerns a junk dealer, or as he prefers, Antiquer, who saves a young boy (David Duran) from drowning late one night. Chevalier takes the child to the childhood home of his mother, who has just committed suicide, only to be turned out by her cruel father (Russell Simpson). The boy's pretty aunt Louise (as in `Every little breeze\u0085) (Sylvia Beecher), is sympathetic, but dares not cross her father. Maurice decides to raise the orphan himself. Later he sings at the local Flea Market, is discovered by a theatre manager and more importantly, the theatre owner's wife. When he has to choose between success or love\u0085 well, what would you do? This is a star making performance by a true original. His obvious love of life is a breath of fresh air. And this film contains more of his music hall act than any of his others including his eccentric dancing style and sexy posturing paid tribute to in Love Me Tonight. I saw this film in March of 2004 at the CINEFEST film festival in Syracuse, NY. Thank god for film festivals like this one that make rare films like this available and the folks who provide comments to IMDB for others to share. Please support the IMDB and early film festivals!

                "text": "\nThe New Babylon was recognized as a masterpiece as early as 1929. It was rediscovered at the 1958 Bruxelles Expo but properly presented with the original Shostakovich score only in the eighties. The original Shostakovich score (opus 18) had been synchronized with the film under the personal supervision of its director Leonid Trauberg (1901-1990) and - according to Trauberg - he had never 'seen' his film in that final state before 1981. A valuable estimation of the picture can be found in Jay Leyda's KINO. One should realize that there is only one definite version of the picture: the GOSFILOMOFOND print, running for about 90 minutes at variable speed. There is however an apocryphal print about, a clipping together of the original print and approximately another 33% of out-takes. German film historians are responsible for this horrible mutilation of the original. When this version was shown in Hamburg in 1983 a press bulletin explained that scenes had been added that were once removed by censorship. However, what had been added were only discarded scenes that had been cut because they were too dull; for instance actrice Kuzmina in front of a cupboard of hat boxes or actor Sobolevsky with his wounded arm in a sling as an unlikely cabaret artist in 1871 'Gay Paris'.  Director Leonid Trauberg saw this `German' version with the extra footage \"that I cut out myself\" and has furiously tried to prohibit its screening. A lengthy statement about the original and apocryphal print of The New Babylon was sent to various cinema museums by Trauberg in October 1983. His statement is to be found in `Eisenstein was Great Eater' - In Memory of Leonid Trauberg / Graduate Press, Buren, Netherlands, pp. 107-109 (ISBN 90-72058-07-0). The New Babylon is one of the greatest masterpieces of the Russian cinema. However the German version with its complimentary footage is a disgrace for the profession of film restoration. In fact the best guideline to follow is the original score composed for the picture by Shostakovich in 1929. Its greatest advocate is maestro Mark Fitz-Gerald from Croydon, associated with the Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra. If you have any doubts about music or print contact Theodore van Houten, POB 1, Haamstede, 4328 ZG-Netherlands.\n",

Perhaps there were reasons to oppose the Paris Commune, although none occur to me. However, a discussion of propaganda in films is in itself somewhat redundant: most films might face the same charges. After all, film is an art form that chooses to present a series of images and sounds, usually dialogue but also music (and in this case there is in the best version a stunning score by Shostakovich) in order to manipulate the feelings and the thoughts of the viewer. \"Apocalypse Now\", for instance, is an examination of war and its component parts that does not shy away from politics or advocacy. It is clear to the viewer that the filmmaker is asking questions about why that war was fought. \"Armaggedon\" also supports a particular political world view, as does \"First Blood\", \"The Seventh Seal\", \"Sex in the City\" and even \"Toy Story\".\n\nDespite my sympathies, however, it is not the politics that I love about this film - it is not the message but the artful use of the medium that sells me on this work of art. This is a moving and beautiful film, with fully realised character development and wonderfully magical imagery. After the parasols, the train and the cancan dancers, you should keep an eye out in particular for the shots in the last segments of the film. Kozintsev and Trauberg work little miracles with everyday objects such as lace, shovels and pianos. (Amazingly enough, these artists continued their magic for a long time -Trauberg worked until the early 1960s and Kozintsev directed his last film, which many consider the best \"King Lear\" for the cinema, in 1971.) \"New Babylon\" is, in a number of ways, a good companion piece for \"The Man with a Movie Camera\", the best of the Russian silents that I have seen. While it does indulge the \"message\" shot - there are a number of those but most are extremely well-done and worth seeing; the milk-for-soldiers is one, the juxtaposed lives are another - it is the realism of this film that elevates it, not its occasional slip into histrionics. The female lead, Yelena Kuzmina, is excellent, an actress who commands your attention and earns your sympathy, but it is in all the secondary roles put together that the city of Paris of 1870 and 1871 truly comes alive. In these earlier films, before sound drew us in, it was the faces that needed to speak, and these do, eloquently. The department store owner, the old soldiers, the contemptuous general, the washerwomen and the journalist with hope for humanity, they are all clamoring to tell you something. Exactly what they say to you may depend on your own world view, but their comments should be interesting to everyone.",

The current surviving sections start with Charley in a very funny gag, follow through for a bit, and then jump to the predictable ending.\n\nAs Universal dumped almost all its silent footage in 1948, it seemed for a long time that this was all that survived -- a terrible fate for Charley Chase fans. However, the word at Slapsticon '07 is that there are private collectors out there with enough footage to just about make up the entire movie and Universal is interested..... so stay tuned.\n\nJuly 14, 2008: I have just heard that this movie has been restored and will be exhibited in Syracuse this summer. I look forward to hearing impressions of it and hope to see the restoration for myself some time.\n\nJuly 17, 2010\n\nWell, three years have passed and I have finally seen the restored version -- Universal spent the money for no good reason except that it pleases film fans to have their films. Bravo!\n\nThe first two thirds of this part-talkie are very good. Like most part-talkies, the first half is a silent, and the second half is a talkie. And for two thirds of the movie, through the end of the party scene -- watch out for Anita Garvin, Roach's go-to gal for sexy shrews and a great series of reaction shots -- this is a great picture. I would guess that Chase directed his comedy gags and the dinner scene which is great comedy as Chase makes a fool of Jean Hersholt and the diners. But afterwards, it turns serious and rather dull -- Kathryn Crawford is awful in her line readings and Chase is dull and slow. As with far too many comedies, the plot interferes with the fun.\n\nStill, I am vastly pleased that Universal spent the money. If they ever decide to release this on DVD for the nine copies they think the can sell, I'll make it ten.",

Sailor become farm hand become sealing ship marksman Sivert Br\u00e6kemo has to assert his claim to the contested rifle, the position of gunner and the retiring captain's daughter in the middle of clambering round the real ice flows, where they filmed. Attention is riveted. Hard to relate it's Arctic realism with the director's great, later Strindberg films, beyond the authority he already showed. \n\nThis one should have been circulating to acclaim for the last seventy years.",

Dave becomes interested in Molly Williams but Blake, a banker, and Bowle, a cattle-buyer, determine to do away with Dave by framing him for the death of the Ranger. Dave escapes and appears in the saloon at midnight and just as the guilty man is about to confess (and implicate Blake)he is killed by Blake.

                "text": "This was the very first Italian sound feature film to be released, though Blasetti's \"Resurrectio\", released a year later in 1931, was actually shot before this one. It was based very loosely on a Luigi Pirandello short story called \"In Silence\" and is about a woman who cares for her widowed mother's out-of-wedlock child. In the short story it was about a man who cares for his widowed mother's son.\n\nReturning from her music studies in Rome to her distant town after receiving word about her ailing widowed mother, Lucia (Dria Paola) discovers that mom has died and that she had given birth to son out of wedlock. The father had pretty much abandoned the mother. Lucia decides to become the mother to her little half-brother, sever a relationship with her boyfriend Enrico (Elio Steiner) and keeps the nature of the situation quiet. Her landlady helps tend the baby while Lucia works in a Rome record store/ recording studio as a sales clerk, having abandoned her pursuit of a singing career in order to care for the baby.\n\nAt a certain point the child's father returns to claim his son. Enrico, now a successful conductor, has met Lucia again and wants to resume their relationship. In a quandary about what to do about the child, whom she cannot abandon, and a man who clearly loves her, she is about to attempt suicide until Enrico stops her just in time. He has had an encounter with the boy's father and he assures Lucia that she, he, and baby Ninn\u00ed will be together as a family.\n\nAlthough laced with elements of soap opera, the film is nicely acted and manages to engross the viewer so that one really cares about what happens to this poor woman and her \"son\" that she has grown to love. The boy, at the age of 14 months, is played by this sweetheart of a kid named Nello Rocchi. The film has some genuinely touching moments. My favorite one is when Lucia is at a loss about how to change and diaper the child on her first day with him. She looks out the apartment window across the way at another mom who is bathing, changing, and nursing her own child. Lucia imitates what the other mother is doing as though the neighbor were providing how-to instructions in motherhood. The only thing she cannot imitate is the breast-feeding; Lucia ponders the difference between herself and her neighbor, then grabs the baby-bottle to feed little Ninn\u00ed. All this is accompanied by a lovely ninna-nanna in the background.\n\nSome nice views of Rome in 1930 provide backgrounds, including the Spanish Steps. From Lucia's window you can make out the dome of Saint Peter's Basilica in the distance. \"La canzone dell'amore\" (The Song of Love) was extraordinarily popular at the time of its release in Italy, and critics praised its beauty and skill at the hands of director Gennaro Righelli as well as the performances, especially that of Dria Paola.\n\nThe movie was simultaneously shot in two alternate versions, French and German, called \"La Derni\u00e8re berceuse\" and \"Liebeslied.\"",

            "This is an English language film (made in America) adapted from a novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque. The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.",
            "With the onset of World War I, a group of students are egged on by their teacher and enlist in the German army. As seems to be the case with all wars, the young men march off in the belief that the war will be a short one and they will all soon be home, basking in the glory of victory and treated as heroes. Reality begins to set in at the training depot where their one-time amiable local postman is now their demanding training instructor. Soon shipped to the front, they face the daily challenge of surviving trench warfare and killing on a scale that they could never have imagined. All become disillusioned with their once great cause and many suffer from shell shock, severe wounds or simply are killed. One of them, Paul, manages to survive for several years at the front. After some leave at home after being wounded, he is dismayed to find that little has changed and his old professor is still encouraging his students to bask in the glories of war. Paul returns to the front for the last time."

                "text": "\nTo say that this movie is one of the greatest war films of all time would be an understatement.  Naturally, since the picture is based on Erich Maria Remarque's marvelous novel, the screenwriter was given quite a powerful story to begin with.  The three main reasons why I consider this movie so forceful are the acting, the cinematography, and simply the sincerity.\n\nLew Ayres, the man who plays Paul Baumer, convincingly portrays the main character in many ways.  First of all, the sheer innocence of his facial appearance adds a poignant touch to the film, because the overwhelming theme of the story is how the war effects all young people of each nation, whether that person dies in the trenches or survives only to lament his days in the war.  Ironically, when the film was initially being put together, Remarque, the novelist who won critical acclaim for writing the book, was asked to play the role of Paul.  Having seen time in the war the producers must have thought him aptly prepared to play the role.  But he declined because he had other commitments and because he felt he was not such a great actor.  Lucky for us, because Ayres gives a powerful performance.  Other characters with relatively minor roles have major importance in the film because they portray touching, heart wrenching scene s\nof death.  These peripheral characters all help add to the general tone of the film (and the book) because they show how dark and terrible the war can be; and they in turn show how propaganda can be so harmful, because most of the soldiers in Paul's regiment are volunteers who receive a very rude awakening when they discover what the war is really all about.  The acting is simply superb, and perhaps this is due to the fact that the famous director George Cukor was an assistant who, although uncredited, came onto the set to help supervise the actors (possibly because director Lewis Milestone's English was not too good).\n\nThe cinematography of this film is absolutely magnificent.  The film rarely has gory sequences because the director finds other ways to imply death and still have the same emotional effect.  One way in which he does this is by showing single body parts (such as a hand or a leg) and allowing these appendages to show the death of the soldier as a whole.  Also, the cameraman uses overhead angles at times with great skill and also focuses on the trenches at times as the soldiers fall back into them after being shot (which implies that the trenches are a symbol of hell, because soldiers fall into them to die).  In short, the cinematographer Arthur Edeson allows the camera to do the talking and to drive the film, rather than the dialogue (speaking of which, there is relatively little; the actors' facial expressions do the bulk of the talking in the film).\n\nWhen I say this film is sincere I really can't give you any tangible evidence to prove the point; all I can tell you is to see the film.  The film at times overwhelmed me with emotion to the extent that I got goose bumps from watching some of the more agonizing scenes.  In a way, this movie is much like a silent film.  This stands to reason because it came at the very beginning of the 'talkie' age, only three years after The Jazz Singer (1927).  Also, Milestone directed silent films before this one, and he seemed to know that less focus on dialogue and more focus on acting would bring about an overwhelmingly emotional and well, sincere, film.  The film obviously had an effect on its star, Mr. Ayres, because once World War II began and he was drafted into the war, he conscientiously protested serving in the army because of his opinions towards war.  I believe he admits that his opinions stem from his work in this movie.  Certainly this is a powerful admission, because his protest caused him and his films to be blacklisted in Hollywood, and his career suffered greatly because of his ideals.  So if you don't believe my words about the power of this film, believe his.",

                "text": "As I write, this is probably the oldest film I've currently seen (I haven't seen too many flicks pre-1950s - shameful, I know), but one that still holds astonishingly well to this day; a poignant and hard-hitting anti-war drama that details life in the German side of the trenches of WWI, it has lost none of its knuckle since it first veered onto the screens nearly 75 years ago. It makes its point and pulls no punches doing so, illustrating the impersonal coldness of war and the desolation in rendering an 'enemy' of someone who you'd really have no issues with on an individual basis. This message is particularly well-captured in one especially harrowing scene - I won't divulge in the details, for the sake of those still yet to witness this masterpiece, but needless to say, it's a real tear-jerker. The war depicted here is not one of glory and heroism, but one of hardship, horror and desperation.\n\n(Also, isn't it kinda eerie how those dramatic battle sequences, in which the opposing soldiers become little more than human targets, now, with retrospect, echo the vicious gameplay of a shoot-em-up video game?)\n\nThe only really noticeable problem with this film comes in the heavy use of US accents, which clash somewhat with the German setting and therefore sound just a little offbeat. Nonetheless, the well-assembled cast more than compensate with some truly impassioned performances, notably from Lew Ayres, who is simply brilliant as Paul, the young protagonist coming of age in this harsh environment. His friendship with long-time solider Katczinsky adds moments of warmth as well as sorrow, and the dialogue exchanged between the close-knit group of soldiers is both absorbing and believable, drawing you closer into their world and experiencing their own frustration and disillusionment along with them. Right from the start, we know what's inevitable for the optimistic young soldiers as they head out to the trenches, but at the same time we value their hope and innocence and yearn that they might be able to retain it all the same, making it all the more tragic as the events of the battlefield lay waste to their youthful spirits.\n\nWith its gripping direction and powerful imagery, it's a film that manages to leave a considerable imprint on the viewer, and I speak from experience on that one - upon reaching the end, both myself and the entire party I viewed it with were left speechless, and it took a good couple of minutes before any of us could pluck up the courage to break that uneasy silence. I don't know for sure when I'll be up for watching it a second time, but that final feeling certainly won't be going away from me any time soon, and I can almost guarantee this the kind of film you'll be glad for watching at least once. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' remains one of the must-see movies of its decade, and it's easy to see why, after all this time, it still has such a firm hold on that classic status - it may have arrived on the scene as far back as 1930, but its emotive edge is timeless.\n\nGrade: A+",

                "text": "Erich Maria Remarque's novel and the film made from it may possibly be the greatest anti-war statement ever created. All Quiet on the Western Front won a deserved Best Picture Academy Award in the year it came out and brought great prestige to Universal Pictures as the first Oscar in that category won by that studio.\n\nLew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. The whole class enlists and that's not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. \n\nI'm sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.\n\nOnly it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.\n\nYou lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.\n\nAnd it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.\n\nLew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. \n\nLouis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.\n\nThe third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die. Wray plays an officious mail man who is in the German Army Reserve. He gets called up and this little nobody gets rather impressed with himself and his new found authority as a training sergeant to Ayres and his friends. Later on at the front, he gets a view of combat he wasn't quite ready for.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front with its eternal message of peace and life will be one eternal film, it will be shown and appreciated for many generations to come.",

The film deals with World War I combat through the eyes of the enemy (the Germans).  For the first time ever it was realized how heartbreaking war really is, for all involved.  One key message within the film is that innocence cannot survive on the battlefield.  War is an awful thing that has no true winners, just losers.  Brilliant performances from all involved make the film believable and accurate for the most part.  A very young Lew Ayres is the best as his story creates tension for the entire film.  This is perhaps the first film that proved that the cinema could be a truly imperative medium.  The film was scorned by many in the U.S. as some thought that showing the Germans as sympathetic characters was in poor taste.  Germans hated the film because of its anti-war message.  Hitler was about to become a world power and he wanted all Germans to be excited and enthusiastic about combat.  This film goes against those ideals.  The Academy was brave enough and smart enough to award the film with the Best Picture Oscar in 1930 and Lewis Milestone became the first multiple Oscar winner in the directing category.  \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" has the storyline of Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\" and the action and drama of Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\".

Too many war dramas, regardless of their perspective, resort to distortions of history and overblown characters that make them convincing only to those who watch uncritically.  This one works nicely by keeping the characters low-key and by, for the most part, allowing the events and situations to speak for themselves.  It's not perfect in this respect, and it is perhaps a movie more to be respected than enjoyed, but it has many notable strengths.\n\nThe characters, most of them young soldiers, are played very simply, even plainly, but this is by no means a weakness - rather, it allows the movie to show what war is like for real soldiers rather than for idealized or stereotyped characters.  The two most important characters are developed more fully, and are played well.  Louis Wolheim's resourceful 'Kat' is the liveliest of the soldiers, and as Paul, Lew Ayres is quite understated but very believable.  His character is well-chosen as the focal point of most of the movie.  \n\nThe close-fighting nature of World War I particularly lends itself to this kind of movie, and the atmosphere is convincing and detailed.  The contrast with the civilian scenes is also set up well, although the civilian scenes sometimes seem slightly less convincing.

Consider the part where one young man is told that maths problems are a waste of time as he could stop a bullet at any time, or the sequence that sees a soldier try to save the life of his fellow man that he has stabbed in the stomach (a French soldier, but still a fellow man). Not to mention the classy finish. Whichever way you look at it; this film is a masterpiece. It succeeds on a technical level and also does what films were created to do; entertain and inspire thought from their audiences. There are some films that every film buff must see regardless of their genre preferences. This is one of them.",

Ayres gives a sensitive and powerful performance: by the 2nd World War the actor chose to serve as a medic, where he gained distinction.\n\nRemembered for the sequence with the butterfly at the end in particular, this early talkie manages to set its scene and transmit a powerful message.

The latter version has more scenes from the book and better acting, yet it's still inferior.  It suffers from the lack of detail that so many tv productions had then along with comparatively flat lighting.  The first version, on the other hand, has a look that resembles a documentary on World War I. They filmed it only eleven years after the war ended, and it contains a power only possible by those who've lived through an era being dramatized.

Outside, martial music is blaring and the professor inside the room is lecturing the boys about their duty to the Fatherland and encouraging them all to as a group in the German army at the outbreak of WWI. The film is exceptional in how it captures the enthusiasm and naivet\u00e9 of the boys--as they imagine glory awaiting them after they enlist! Even in boot camp, the mood is light and the new recruits are excited about seeing their first action. This perfectly sets the stage for the actual war--not the sanitized or \"fun\" war of many films but the hellish and pointless mess that was WWI. The rest of the film is brutally honest and harsh and shows how the students die off one-by-one and the remaining students become more and more jaded and emotionally dead due to the fighting.\n\nI love this film and strongly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff. Part of my love of the film is because it was made relatively shortly after the war and the uniforms, trucks, etc. all appear correct for the period. Many years later, a made for TV version of this film appeared with Ernest Borgnine and Richard Thomas. It, too, was excellent but also was perhaps a bit too polished and pretty--lacking some of the grit of the original. Great acting, direction and production all made this original THE best of the anti-war films of the 1920s and 30s.\n\nOther similar great movies I strongly recommend are J'ACCUSE (French), WESTFRONT 1918 (German), THE BIG PARADE (USA--silent) and THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK (USA). All excel at portraying war in a truthful and non-glamorized manner--it's just a shame that their impact of the world as a whole was negligible--particularly in Germany--where Fascism would soon replace the anti-war sentiment of the book ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In fact, his books and this film were banned once the Nazis came to power just a few years later.",

It's still one of most powerful movies ever made, out of any genre or time period. And not just that, the movie is also really among the best ever made.\n\nThe movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers during WW I, of which most of them are still just only school kids in the beginning. First we see how the very young boys are being reprogrammed as soldiers. Then we see how they all are slowly going crazy, due to the madness of war. After that the movie shows the aftereffects of war, on those who fought in it. From the hospital till their leave back home, this movie shows and tells it all. We further more see them dealing with all kinds of problems; the lack of food, rats, the death and see them discuss the point of war. Or like Paul B\u00e4umer sums up in the movie; \"We live in the trenches out there. We fight. We try not to be killed, but sometimes we are. That's all.\"\n\nIt's not hard to see that this movie influenced many other later war/anti-war movies, even till this present day, with \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"Starship Troopers\" as the most obvious and best known examples.\n\nFor its time period this was also a very graphic movie, although no way people will now be shocked by any of the 'gore' within this movie. Nevertheless the movie its violence and disturbing moments still haven't lost any of its power. This is also thanks to the great build-up directing by Lewis Milestone. He knows how to create the right certain tension and the atmosphere that goes with it. He also had a real eye for detail, especially of course during the battle sequences. Because of its many little details the movie also becomes a very realistic one.\n\nThe movie features some great looking and also at times innovating The camera positions and angles, as well as the good fast editing. It makes this a technical fantastic movie to watch.\n\nObviously none of the actors are among the greatest of their time but the characters are all nevertheless great, since they are very humane and realistic and each has their own strong identity.\n\nA movie that you HAVE to see at least once in your lifetime.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

                "text": "Surprisingly powerful after almost eighty years, this is a true \"anti-war movie.\" \"Anti-war\" is an adjectival phrase flung around too easily these days. Any recent movie with an excess of gore can be called anti-war, but if you leave the theater glowing with pride at the sacrifice and heroism of our own boys and girls, anxious for the next opportunity to display those old-fashioned virtues, you're not talking \"anti-war.\" This one, like a few others, leaves you feeling that you've witnessed not a brave last stand but a moral tragedy as well as a material disaster. Few movies make that cut. \"Das Boot\" and \"Go Tell the Spartans\" come to mind. They're not necessarily great movies, but they're definitely anti-war.\n\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (the title is ironic) tells the story of a handful of school boys who leap at the opportunity to join the army at the beginning of World War I and kill the enemy. By the end they are disillusioned and dead. We know they have lost hope not only because they tell us so but because the director (Lewis Milestone) and the writer show us a few of the details by which ideals are lost.\n\nThe dialog and some of the acting are pretty corny by today's standards, and the general outlines of the story, a kind of Bildungsfilm, are overly familiar by now. But it must have been quite shocking on its release because, as a matter of fact, it's STILL shocking. Much of its success is due to the special effects. The incoming artillery shells seem to whistle this way and that, up and down the scale, before exploding in what looks like lethal bouquets of crumbled soil. The mortar rounds don't even whistle. There's only a quick, silly ZOOP, a small pop of dirt, and a man is dead, a stylized fatality.\n\nLewis Milestone has been criticized for being too obvious but I don't know why. He puts his camera on a dolly and runs it at speed across a line of charging men, watching them fall in irregular groups, and it's a powerful and original technique. And the scene in which Lew Ayres tries to talk to the dying French soldier he's just bayoneted is clumsy and ill acted but still wrenching. Particularly effective is Milestone's set-up after the Frenchman has died. The corpse is propped up in a sitting position, a slight, strangely peaceful smile on its face, and Ayres must spend the night next to this horrifying apparition.\n\nLew Ayres turns in the performance of a novice. He was to become a conscientious objector in World War II and it damaged his career, although, as a medic, he performed under combat conditions like any other soldier. Louis Wolheim is Kat, the wised-up veteran with a face like the rear end of the huge, dirty truck you get stuck behind on the Sunday night Long Island Expressway. \n\nI think I'll let it go at that. It's an iconic film and not one you're likely to forget in a hurry.",

It's quite simply a wonderful film on the morality (or lack of) of war, and perhaps the most convincing anti-war film I've seen, focusing purely on the feelings our lead character Paul Baumer.\n\nIt starts off with blind optimism during the recruitment process and after a harsh induction programme in a segment that Kubrick gleans so much from in his 'Full Metal Jacket' film. The dormitories are almost an exact copy and the Drill Seargent is a mean guy just like R.Lee Ermey's was.\n\nDuring the first night on the field and their introduction to Katczinski, who seems like a man to fear, new recruit Behn, a man who didn't want to enlist is killed in horrific fashion and the new recruits are given a glimpse of what is to come. \"He's a corpse, no matter who he was\" is Katczinski's reply to one of the new recruits who wails \"he was my friend\". Truly awful stuff. We're quickly whisked to the first daylight trench battle which has some incredibly dynamic camera-work and the B&W and speeded up film almost makes it feel real. Here is a film that can use little in the way of gore, but create a far more terrifying atmosphere than even the opening of \"Saving Private Ryan\".\n\n\"War is like a fever. No one wants it but it is there all at once\" As the war progresses, the boys receive letters from home. This should be a joyous occasion, and is for some, but Baumer is not so convinced. We start to get the feeling that this place isn't the place for letters. It isn't the place for hope.\n\nOne of the key scenes follows where Baumer single handedly kills a man with a knife and is forced to spend the night with him in a hole as he dies. Begging the man for forgiveness highlights his inner fight. Everything is telling him war is wrong, but we know he is being dragged into it and irreversibly changed.\n\nIt's not completely devoid of humour though. Part way into the second act and after Katczinski and the other old hand's have softened (or is it that the new recruits have simply hardened giving us an illusion) we are treated to a scene with some lovely French peasant girls, and the betrayal of Himmelstoss, getting him blind drunk so the three young boys can have a girl each is particularly funny.\n\nPossibly the saddest part of the film is towards the end where Baumer is injured and able to spend some time on leave at home. He soon realises after visiting his family and the professor who enlisted him that he doesn't belong there. He'd rather be on the front line with Katczinski and pals where he knows where he stands.\n\nAnd with that, I'll leave it there. The final 10 minutes is heartbreaking and it is no wonder that the armed forces at the time prevented recruits from seeing this film. It's an indictment of the true inhumanity of war, and a film that is so important in our history as human beings.",

Removed from the tumultuousness of combat in central Europe, the United States had manufactured a conception of WWI as a scenario of glamorized heroics!! Once defense and attack initiatives commenced in Germany, as well as many other battleground nations in Europe, the entire plethora of unfriendly combat zones now evoked an onslaught of many visceral displays of distasteful reality!! World War I was known as one of the bloodiest wars in history!! Relentless in the pursuit of patriotic cause, the United States marched through Europe during WWI with rose colored glasses on!! These elements of apocalyptic miscalculation were what articulated some fatal delusions of grandeur!! This complicated rancor was the primary focus to the film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is considered by movie experts to be one of the greatest films ever made!! This website ranks this film 207th best film out of the top 250 films ever made!! AFI (American Film Institute) ranks \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" one of the top 100 American films to ever hit the cinema!! Such accolades are largely due to the fact that the emotional revelations of WWI which this film necessitates, presented themselves with a very disconcerting premise; in turn, it became something that served as a stark awareness to the American public!! Lewis Milestone directs this film, he directed \"Pork Chop Hill\" and was very involved in the making of \"I Want You\"; Both of these films are Korean War films, Lewis Milestone pinpoints the dismal realities of the cerebral repercussions of American military conflicts!! A bittersweet concept emanating from the film \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" is that there is always a tragic price paid for getting involved in a war!! All three of these war films delve into the devastating aftermath of battling in the trenches. These acts were veritable nightmares which resulted in killing the enemy for survival!! The desperation to comprehend such remorseful consequences, which initially started out as a preconceived camaraderie, that eventually became a line of logic which was thoroughly vitiated in every conceivable manner, wound up being a ubiquitous form of psychological disarray for all the American soldiers coming home. The aggregate tragedy from WWI which this film \"ALL Quiet on the Western Front\" depicted, left the movie audience spellbound!!!! Bear in mind, in 1930, American movies were all about escapism, not about the scathing moral drawbacks to wartime combat!! The movie \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, and, the film expedites the same candor as the novel does about what the acrimonious truth to what World War I was actually about.. The end of the film depicts how the guise of national omnipotence, which translated to the loss of thousands of young lives for questionable motives, became something that the United States government was peccant for!! \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won for best picture in 1930, deservedly so too!! This movie encompassed many components of a devastating interruption to a glossy and stilted mendacity which the American movie goer was accustomed to accepting!! I do not think that any other movie up until 1930, the year that \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" was produced, had accomplished such an unprecedented feat!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS MOVIE!!",

I could use so many superlatives to describe it but watching Milestone's war/epic left me cold with all the self- glorification and enthusiasm that only serves as a desire to hide the awareness of our own mediocrity. I will only say that \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is a masterpiece because it's the first movie to make a political statement, and a courageous one, not pacifist but humanistic. If only for that, Milestone's film is a milestone on the field of cinematic intelligence.\n\n\"This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.\"\n\nIf not an accusation, it does admit that a generation was destroyed. If not a confession, the film demonstrates that it takes war to realize life's value just as it takes jail to value freedom. And if not an adventure, it still conveys the strange exhilarating feeling of an escape from the world's lies and politicians' vanity, to reach a point where people can become fully themselves, as said Louis-Ferdinand Celine, a French WWI veteran and author: \"Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth\" in 'Journey to the End of the Night'.\n\nMore than an accusation, confession or adventure, the story is a tribute to a lost generation, the year of the release is even more significant because those who survived the War were not only alive, but young enough to have kept intact memories. \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is a tribute to a youth sacrificed by greed, profit and patriotic glory in the altar of trenches, where every mile cost thousands of bodies. The film starts with boys whose eyes harangued by the patriotic speech of their school professor, burn with the intensely proud flame to fight in the name of Germany and desire of victory... and eventually to leave school. The first bombing will shatter all these beliefs, as they'll understand that whether you fight for French Motherland of German Fatherland, Mother Earth is the ultimate destination.\n\nMost of the actors were not professional except for the extraordinary performance of Louis Wolheim as Kat, a mentor for the boys and for us. The actors were as inexperienced and youthful, as the boys who were listed and criticizing the acting on that level is like stamping on an ant when you can admire its strength: the cast embodies the tragedy of a War that dug a big hole in a whole generation. The last shot of the boys walking and turning their faces at us, juxtaposed with the sight of a mortuary, is like a warning for the years to come. But history taught us war is indeed a fever that just strikes everybody, nobody wants it until it happens and everybody wants it until they make it.\n\nIt's only at war that the soldiers can question its meaning, its origin, and only at war that the ranks, medals and protocols make no difference whatsoever. The most zealous drill sergeant starts sobbing at the first shell wheezing, highlighting one of war's few consolations: to reveal the true value of people in life and make everyone equal in death. In a powerful scene, Paul, the central character stabs for the first time a French soldier, and as he spends some time hidden with the body, he talks to him and realizes that they're both comrades, brothers, victims of the same political vanity and full of the same desire to live. All that separates them is a uniform, and to Death, even uniforms don't make a damn difference. The merit of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is to be told from German perspective, from the enemy, the other, and what better lesson for empathy than inviting an audience to comprehend that the other side, like in \"Das Boot\" for WWII, shared the same trauma? \n\nAnd Milestone's film renders the most horrific aspects of war without any other special effects than an extraordinary editing and directing. 68 years before \"Saving Private Ryan\"'s iconic opening, Milestone showed soldiers hit by a volley of machine-gun fire, falling but with such a fast-paced directing that we never see them hitting the ground. Some shot show shadowy soldiers jumping from below as to suggest a human submersion, the atrocities and pointlessness of War never seemed so raw and real as in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", because it showed what a slaughter World War I was, whether Spielberg's point was only to show that the second one was a good war.\n\nWhen the few survivors came back to their hometown, they realize that the attitude and the enthusiasm toward the war were unchanged. Civilians and military, Family, the teacher, the boys in the classroom didn't learn anything. \"And our bodies are earth, and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death!\" says Paul but he only receives insults and incomprehension. But he knows, and we know from his experience that he's the one who owns the truth, because in his mind are all his friends dead in the trenches, in the battlefield, in a lousy hospital. \n\nBut the tragedy of life is that as usual, it's not the dead but the living that need to be awakened.",

A truly harrowing, and one feels, incredibly realistic, portrayal of the horrors of WW1, this is uncomfortable, yet essential and compelling viewing. Lew Ayres gives a beautiful performance as the young soldier protagonist. For a film made when sound was in its infancy, it is astonishingly fresh on a technical level. The camera-work is innovate and imaginative, the dialogue well-written and considered, the directing excellent, and the acting profound. An extremely important film on many levels.",

The movie is also completely devoid of background music to artificially stir the audience, allowing the quiet dignity of the boys themselves to be the sole focus. \n\nThis movie could never be made today because American filmmakers (and film-goers) would expect to impose 21st Century cunning and bravado onto what was a very innocent generation of kids who had never traveled more that a mile or two from their farms or towns and who found themselves in an overwhelming nightmare of mud-sucking trenches, mustard gas, and mortar shells, who died without glory and without their mother's comfort. The movie was made 12 years after the war ended, reflecting a less complicated Germany, and could not even have been made a few years later, after Hitler perfected hatred and killing as a national sport.\n\nIt may be hard for us raised on pro-war anti-Nazi movies to believe that the German soldier could be so tender as this \u0096 but consider the German-initiated, unofficial Christmas truce of 1914, when German and British troops defied their officers and ventured into no man's land between the trenches to exchange Christmas trees, gifts, beer, food, photos, and even addresses with promises to write each other when the war ended! They even played an impromptu game of soccer and sang Christmas carols together. There was probably less hatred between the German soldier and his enemies in WWI than there was between Americans in the American Civil War.\n\nRemember, too, that this was the last major war between Christian countries, when Christian values and old-world chivalry made their last stand on the battlefield. (Another great WWI film, also made in the thirties, that reflects this chivalry is Jean Renoir's \"The Grand Illusion.\") Later opponents of the U.S. were either atheists (Nazis & communists), Buddhists (Japanese, Koreans and Vietnamese), or Muslims (Iraqis), none of whom would ever wax warm and fuzzy over Christmas or come singing across the battlefield to the tune of \"Stille Nacht.\" So the enemy armies of WWI had a lot in common and no real reason to hate each other. In later wars, Americans have found it easier to dehumanize and even \"demonize\" the enemy because he is not Christian and therefore not \"like us.\" All Quiet On the Western Front reminds us that ALL our enemies are \"like us\".\n\nAbove all, All Quiet On the Western Front is a damning indictment against war, not by preaching or pontificating, but by the stunning, haunting, utterly silent ending image of all the dead boys who walk silently away at the end, each looking back at us over his shoulder with an accusing look -- accusing the audience, accusing us, for their deaths.",

The viewer is placed directly in the battlefield to the point he can almost grasp the blood-soaped earth of the trenches and smell the rotten corpses in no-man's land.\n\nThere's two layers I can find in this movie: the first one tells us about the physical destruction endured in a war \u0096 hunger, dirt, explosions, amputations, diseases, death\u0085 The film does not try to hide the truth, war is ugly and dirty, it is constant suffering and painful. If the first layer is strong enough to create a strong impression on the viewer, the second one is even more powerful: the psychological breakdown the soldiers experience is masterfully portrayed. The excitement turns into doubt, the doubt into disgust, the disgust into anger and the anger into complete numbness. A young promising student is gradually transformed into a soulless killing machine.\n\nAlso the acting deserves to be mentioned. The entire cast delivers stand up performances, especially Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres who depict masterfully two generations united by war.\n\nThe only flaw I could find on this is the strong American accent on the few German words spoken, fact that can distract a bit especially on the beginning of the movie.\n\nOverall, this is an overwhelming experience and a mandatory watch to every war film lover!",

It's interesting to note that some scenes were deemed so realistic they were used in genuine WW1 documentaries many years later, so if you were wondering which gutsy cameramen were wading through the mud filming the action...now you know! \n\nWhat I liked most of all about this film is that it left more questions than answers, it did not force any particular opinion on World War 1 or war in general. It seemed to show a realistic portrayal of life in the trenches, fighting a war the soldiers themselves didn't really seem to understand. \n\nExpert food-forager Katczinsky (Louis Wolheim) does come up with a novel approach to how a war could be fought: \"Whenever there's a war coming on, you should rope off a big field...and on the big day you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put 'em in the centre dressed in their underpants and let 'em fight it out with clubs.

                "text": "\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was perhaps the first great war epic of the cinema- certainly the first great war epic of the \"talkie\" era. It was based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, published only the year before. (The phenomenon of film-makers raiding the best-seller lists for inspiration is nothing new). The familiar English title of both book and film is the one assigned to it by Remarque's translator Arthur Wheen, and is something of a mistranslation. Remarque's original title was \"Im Westen Nichts Neues\", or \"Nothing New in the West\", meaning \"no change in the military situation\". \n\nThe film opens in a boys' high school in a small German town in 1914. We see a schoolmaster named Kantorek giving his pupils an impassioned speech, urging them to join the Army and fight for their country. Kantorek ends his peroration with Horace's line \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\" (\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country\"), a line which to English-speaking audiences in 1930 would have recalled Wilfred Owen's poem in which he describes this sentiment as \"the old lie\". \n\nAlmost to a man, the boys are persuaded to join up, and we follow their progress through the war, especially that of the main character, Paul Baumer. (In the novel his surname was B\u00e4umer; perhaps the American actors failed to realise that the umlaut above the \"a\" makes a difference to the German pronunciation. Several names, in fact, are mispronounced; \"Mueller\", for example, is pronounced to rhyme with \"colour\"). We see how early enthusiasm for the war was replaced by disillusionment, at least among those who actually had to do the fighting. One by one Paul's companions are killed or severely wounded, and the mood of the survivors becomes embittered. Their preoccupations are not honour and glory but firstly survival and secondly getting enough food. Only on the home front does enthusiasm for the war persist; visiting his home town on leave Paul is disgusted to see Kantorek giving the same speech to another class of students, who react with the same patriotic zeal as he and his classmates. \n\nIn a film from this period one would not expect the same degree of realism in battle scenes as in a modern film such as \"Saving Private Ryan\", although Steven Spielberg has stated that Lewis Milestone's film was an inspiration for his own. There is, however, one surprisingly good action sequence featuring a French attack on the German trenches, although the most effective scenes are often those, like the one in the hospital and the one where Paul addresses the dead French soldier he has killed, which do not involve any actual fighting. \n\nAlthough there are many grim moments, the film's tone is not unremittingly grim. Scenes of bloodshed and pathos are interspersed with those containing a certain, often satirical, humour, such discussion between the soldiers as to the causes of the war. (They conclude that the best way of solving international disputes would be for the kings and politicians to fight among themselves after stripping down to their underwear). Perhaps the best acting performance comes from Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus Katczinsky, a gruff, cynical older soldier who becomes Paul's closest friend and who, even in the early days of the war, embodies a spirit of sardonic disillusionment. (His surname suggests that he is an ethnic Pole who, while nominally a German citizen, has little loyalty to the German cause). \n\nTo make a war film from a German viewpoint and which treats its German protagonists with humanity and understanding was, in some ways, a brave move in 1930, only a dozen years after the press in America and other Allied nations had been abusing the Germans as \"beastly Huns\". Yet to tell an anti-war story from the German side was, in other ways, politically expedient. Such a story told from an American viewpoint might have been attacked as unpatriotic, as implying that the Allied cause had not been a just one and that the American soldiers who had laid down their lives in 1917-18 had done so to no good end. America, Britain and France had their own Kantoreks- Owen's poem was aimed at one of them, the jingoistic poetaster Jessie Pope- but such people are never mentioned in the film. Audiences might have inferred that \"God, king and country\", or \"the war to end all wars\" were slogans as empty as \"Gott mit uns\" or \"Deutschland \u00fcber Alles\", but Milestone never spells this out directly. \n\nFollowing the bloodshed of World War I, pacifist sentiment was widespread in the twenties and early thirties, and the film takes the same strongly anti-war stance as Remarque's novel. This message was highly popular in 1930; the critic of Variety wrote that \"The League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word \"war\" is taken out of the dictionaries\". \n\nYet we now know this was not to be. To quote another Latin tag, \"tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis\". (Times change, and we change with them). Less than a decade after the film was made, the world was to be plunged into a second war, even bloodier than the first. Lewis Milestone's contribution to that war would be to make patriotic pro-Allied propaganda films such as \"North Star\" and \"The Purple Heart\", demonising the Germans and Japanese as monsters in human form. It might be unfair to accuse Milestone of deliberate hypocrisy- he was far from being the only ex-pacifist to have his pacifism tested to destruction by the savage inhumanity of Nazism- but there is a certain irony in the fact that the cinema's great chronicler of the First World War should have become one of America's Kantoreks of the Second. 8/10",

So, egged on by their teacher and a wave of patriotic enthusiasm, the German boys sign up. But what do they get instead of military glory--- miles and miles of foot slogging mud as the company marches to the WWI battlefront. And that's after they've crawled face down through training fields of the slimy stuff, looking more like human worms than soldiers. \n\nWorse, when they get to the war front, what do they get but more slimy dirt in the trenches that make up their new home. It's all living, eating, and dying in the same wet ground. And when they get killed, as they almost surely will, what will their flesh and bones do but make more mud for new waves of mud-makers to slog through. No wonder the movie is considered an anti-war masterpiece-- military glory itself is reduced to the earth's most elemental stuff.\n\nI've often wondered how American audiences would respond if the boys were American instead of German, given the movie's militantly anti-war message. But however that may be, the 2-hours-plus never drags as we watch the boys encounter the various horrors\u0097and the mischief, too\u0097of life at the front.\n\nNo wonder one kid freaks out when the coffin-like closeness and constant shelling of the trenches finally gets to him. My understanding is that once the battle lines of WWI settled in, the front never moved more than 75-miles in four-years. No wonder the fabled poppy fields of Flanders grew so abundantly afterwards. \n\nAnd if the horrors of the trenches aren't bad enough, there's the \"dying room\" in the hospital where the hopeless cases are taken. There they can expire alone and out of sight. I can imagine how other wounded boys dangled on the precipice of being moved there or anywhere. It's that constant dread amidst the tidy surroundings and caring hands, and far from the battlefield, that's stayed with me over the years.\n\nLewis Milestone's staging of scenes along the front remains a technical marvel. What a triumph of fluid camera work is that panorama of troops attacking across the no-man's-land, only to be mowed down by defenders and their hell-fire machine guns. I gather throwing men at waves of bullets was the basic brutal strategy of both sides. Small wonder then, that the war was also called the great European slaughter bench, and small wonder that a lot of generals on both sides should have been court- martialed, as a result. Fortunately, Milestone's inspired staging makes these larger dimensions understandable.\n\nAt the same time, it's an inspiration to personalize the impersonal dimension of battle. In a shell hole in the middle of no-man's- land, Paul (Ayers) encounters the face of a dying Frenchman, only to realize that the enemy is a man pretty much the same as Paul. That central scene puts a critical human face on the act of killing, transforming combat for Paul and us into an excruciating personal close-up. For without that intimate encounter, the battle scenes would be reduced to an abstraction of colliding gray figures.\n\nThe narrative does have its lighter moments as when three of the boys encounter three French girls, and nature takes its course, helped along, of course, by treasured loaves of bread. In the process, we realize that hunger and lust have a way of cutting through minor matters like who's French or German or anything else. Note too how fairly explicit the innuendo is during this early pre-Code period. There's also that black humor scene of the shells blowing up the graveyard as though dying once just isn't enough in wartime.\n\nThen, of course, there's Louis Wolheim as Kat who steals the film with his gruff humor and unforgettable mug. The final scenes between Paul and him manage a poignancy rare in any film. In fact, as Paul says, Kat has become his \"family\" now that soldiering has consumed them both. Too bad that the boy's horrific experiences have likely separated him forever from mother, sister, and hometown. To me, this is one of the more subtly unsettling aspects of the movie's anti-war message.\n\nAyers hasn't as much depth as I would like, but he does have that critical air of innocence that magnifies the story's tragedy. It's his mere presence, rather than \"acting\", that gets the point across, which is pretty much the case for all the young actors. At the same time, it's hard to forget their one-by-one glances at us as they march off into the anonymous pages of history. \n\nIn fact, the war has done this to thousands like Paul and his comrades, and all the patriotic hype of their elders cannot bring them back or heal the psychic wounds of those who survive. Thanks be to Universal studios and director Milestone for sparing no expense in bringing Remarque's epochal novel to the popular screen. For what they left us with is a truly remarkable film.",

A vividly realistic account of the effects of War World One on young soldiers, the film also boasts some solid acting, grueling cinematography and an unforgettable message, highlighting so poignantly the sheer folly of war.\n\nPerhaps the most curious thing about this film is that, despite being an American production, it follows the misfortunes of a young group of German soldiers. All our German characters speak in fluent English with crisp American accents, though this significant lapse in historical accuracy is extremely effective in allowing us to forget that these men are, after all, the perceived \"enemy side\" in WWI, enlisting our sympathy towards their plight. No longer is the German army portrayed as a mass of faceless, babbling, immoral evil-doers, but each man feels pain, sadness and terror just like any other person would. In this case, it is the English Army who is reduced to becoming the faceless enemy, though the filmmakers stop well short of condemning their actions. In many scenes, it is made irrefutably clear that, with the exception of the politics of their respective governments, there is little difference between the soldiers of either side. Indeed, remove their uniforms, and two opposing soldiers could conceivably become the best of friends. Many of these soldiers are young and scared; many have wives, children, families to come home to; many will ultimately never return from combat.\n\nParticularly poignant is the film's conclusion, as the story's main protagonist, Paul B\u00e4umer (Lew Ayres), is fatally shot whilst reaching towards a quivering butterfly, his outstretched hand falling limp just centimetres from the only remaining thing of beauty in the sullied war zone. This final scene was different from the ending in the book, and, indeed, so late was the decision to shoot it that the director himself was forced to double his own hand as Paul's. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is considered exceptionally graphic for its era, and the Milestone, in order to illustrate the full horrors of war, did not shy away from including brief glimpses of lifeless bodies and severed limbs.\n\nPerhaps a bit melodramatic at times, and not always riveting to watch (some sequences move a bit slowly), Lewis Milestone's classic war film is, nonetheless, not an experience that you are likely to forget anytime soon. Indeed, war is hell, but too often we simply forget that war was hell for the other side, as well...",

The realism of the trenches, war torn no man's land, the uniforms for both sides and the brilliant special effects, mainly revolving around some pretty big explosions near actors, are all superbly created. By today's standards everything still looks good whilst the old black and white imagery only helps the film appear more realistic and authentic. The film could easily be the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its day, its almost as good as real footage.\n\nOf course the actors are of a different era so one can expect performances without the type of grit that we are used to today. Some scenes are almost slightly pantomime-esque with some slightly funny moments of comedy and slapstick which do lighten the mood (mainly at the start before the characters enter the war). I think we all know sequences of corny acting and dialog tend to add to the charm of old movies like this, they are easily forgiven.\n\nMake no mistake though this film is a history lesson and seeing as it was made about 12 years after WW1 actually ended its amazing people watched! especially as it followed the Central Powers (the enemy). Being so close to the war is obviously why its so accurate. The harrowing sequences of men being mown down by machine gun fire, one after another without a chance, the screams of the young troops as they go crazy from the constant shelling, the mud, barren landscapes, bodies, barbwire and of course the famous bleak depressing ending for the main lead nailing home how cheap life was.\n\nI think the main point in the film is how the lead protagonist Paul Baumer (like his friends) starts out as a patriotic young German wanting to go off and fight for his country. Encouraged, motivated and inspired by his surroundings whilst being practically lied to by his school teacher Professor Kantorek into doing what is thought to be right, to save the Fatherland. Baumer then returns to his home town towards the end of the film only to find his school teacher spouting the same nonsense to more young boys, trying to get them to join up and fight. \n\nHe is invited in to speak of the glory of war but instead rages how its all lies and there is nothing but misery and death for all who join up. He is shunned by his old teacher and branded a coward by the young boys, so he returns to the front line. Not long after this the film ends with his pointless needless death. A strong message which we all know of now, yet at the time people just didn't understand or realise, war was glorious and made men of the young.\n\n10/10",

                "text": "Unlike other war films at the time, that seem more romanticize. This film shows the tragedy of the 'Great War' in detail. This detailed thought-provoking war film is a great watch. It's a must watch to anybody over patriotic or looking for heroism, because in its depiction of the horror of war, All Quiet on the Western Front presents a scathing critique of the idea of nationalism, showing it to be a hollow, hypocritical ideology, a tool used by those in power to control a nation's people. Directed by Lewis Milestone, and based on the Erich Maria Remarque novel of the same name. The movie tells the story of six German soldiers who volunteered to fight in World War I, and it chronicles their demise intellectually, spiritually, and physically as the war drags on and on. All Quiet on the Western Front is considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare. Without spoiling too much of the film, it's seem so real. The movie is an intense watch, even with today's standards. The movie is pretty gory, and graphic for a film of the 1930s with scenes with machine guns and poison gas. Lots of unromantic visions of fear, meaninglessness, and butchery. It's a hard watch to certain people. Due to its anti-war message, a lot of countries banned it, like Australia, Italy and Austria. The worst had to be, Nazi Germany. Since the movie perceived anti-German messages, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party banned the film in their country in the 1930s and early 1940s. During its brief run in German cinemas in the early 1930s, the Nazis led by Joseph Goebbels disrupted the viewings by setting off stink bombs and releasing white mice in the theaters. It wasn't until 1952, when West Germany re-released the film in theaters without much protest. It's weird that Universal Studios would product the film like this, at the time because it's tell the war in German perspective, the enemy. This was indeed, rare to do in film, even in today's open world. Show the war in the eyes of the enemy. While, the movie is set in Germany, the movie is pretty English in speaking for the mostly English speaking audience. The movie is worth watching in German dubbing. It's a must-do. If you can't speak German, the film has a lot of visual symbolism to tell the story of the war. A good example of this is, Kemmerich's boots (Ben Alexander). You really see the emotional disconnection that war cause, because when Kemmerich is on his deathbed, the most pressing question among his friends is who will inherit his boots. It's disturbing. In Remarque's view, this pragmatism has a hugely destructive impact on a soldier's humanity; main character, Paul B\u00e4umer (Lew Ayres), for instance, becomes unable to imagine a future without the war and unable to remember how he felt in the past. Another great scene with Paul is that with the dying French soldier. You really see, how Paul is trying to keep his humanity alive, while also keeping himself alive. Great acting from him and all the actors. Another symbol in the film is butterflies. You see it, throughout the film. It derives in part from Remarque's childhood hobby of collecting insects and mounting them in a case. In the film, it seems to represent the innocence and joy of nature. In the film final iconic scene, where a soldier is shot while trying to grab a butterfly. This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an early scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand, instead of the main actor. Some of the faults of the film could be the film's opening prologue. It felt a little detracting, as if they were trying to appeal to everybody, without trying so hard, not to offend people. Another is the mid-scene with the French women. Yes, I guess, it was there, so the movie wasn't too depressing, but it slow the movie, way down. For the most part, the movie is very accurate to the war. Overall: Does an all time, classic stand the test of time? Yes. I think it's better than the 1979 remake. The black and white film footage really makes the war very eerily to watch. In 1930, it really deserve to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing and others. In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Since the movie is still own by Universal Studios, most copies of the film are well preserved. Watching in HD Blu-Ray DVD is in the way, to go, when watching this film. If you really like this movie, read its sequel, 'The Road Back', which shows members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war. It's a must read. Anyways, All Quiet in the Western Front is one of, if not the, most effective war films ever made and it works.",

                "text": "All Quiet on the Western Front is now generally regarded as the first classic movie of the talkie era. Seeing it today, this seems like a pretty fair claim seeing as it's a film that still resonates all these years later. It's pretty uncompromising and hard hitting for its time but this must also surely be a result of it having been made before the seriously restrictive Hays Code was implemented later in the 30's, limiting films for years in what they could show on screen. As it is, this movie was made in the very small window in the early 30's when talkies were not straight-jacketed by this regressive code. It was, nevertheless, a controversial film in other ways. Its strong anti-war message was not one that went down well in many quarters and was considered unpatriotic; while it was also criticised for depicting the Germans in a sympathetic light. It was released only a dozen years after the end of World War 1 and the Germans had been painted as barbarians by much of the then media. But in some ways by centring the story on young German soldiers it was able to distance itself from accusations of an unpatriotic message, seeing as we were not seeing Americans criticising their war effort. But mainly, and more importantly, by focusing on Germans the wider anti-war message is made far clearer, as it's made abundantly obvious that both sides were populated by terrified young men who were fighting a horrific war against each other; a war they had no say in. It was, therefore, a brave and intelligent decision to base the story around young German soldiers. Interestingly, the American Academy clearly agreed and awarded the film best film and director Oscars.\n\nWorld War 1 was a horrific stalemate war that was fought in trenches stretching from the English Channel to the Swiss border. It was arguably the worst war ever in terms of the conditions that soldiers actually fought in. Trench warfare was brutal with tactics that often had men marching against machine guns. Millions of soldiers died in this ludicrous Catch-22 war. And while All Quiet on the Western Front is about this war, it's really more specifically about the lives of the soldiers. There isn't much focus at the history of the conflict itself, the approach is far more personal. We follow a group of young idealistic Germans from the moment they are convinced by highly charged oratory that to die for their country is a great thing, to the grim and horrific reality of what those words actually mean. The film is a thorough condemnation of war. Its characters are very far from gung-ho heroes that we know from many other war films, they are terrified boys. And in choosing this route, the film is far more realistic. The boys realise that the great adventure they believed in, is in fact their worst nightmare. Their experiences are contrasted jarringly with scenes back in the Fatherland where those not involved in the fighting still spout idealistic nonsense about how noble it all is; it's easy being philosophical when your neck is not on the line.\n\nAside from its bold message, it's a technical triumph. Because of its age much of what we see and hear is pretty primitive cinematically. The sound is rough and probably needs subtitles for most people, while the battle scenes can't rely on special effect like we see now. The explosions are real and you really feel a danger in the actual film-making process as a result. The rawness of the production works in its favour. There is no background music either which adds to the sombre realistic tone but may very well have been due to sound recording difficulties - in those days the orchestra had to be playing live just off screen in order to get the synched sound and this would have added huge challenges. It's easy to not realise the technical difficulties that the early sound films had to surmount. But overcome them, this film did and especially so in a brilliant battle scene where the French attack the Germans. This extraordinarily well orchestrated sequence encompasses a huge battlefield with hordes of men advancing over it with explosions going off left, right and centre. The fluid camera work moves across the trenches dramatically capturing the mass attack. The violence is strong for the time, with bloody hand-to-hand fights, dead bodies and even severed limbs. It's worth seeing the film just for this tour de force section alone. But this is a film that counters such striking material with smaller, equally disturbing moments, such as the haunting scene in a bomb crater where one of the protagonists is stranded and forced to spend the night with a French soldier who is slowly dying from a wound he has inflicted on him. It's touching and depressing. There are many such moments in All Quiet on the Western Front. A film that is still extremely relevant today, over 80 years later.",

In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.\n\nYou lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.\n\nAnd it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.\n\nLew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis.\n\nLouis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page.

                "text": "Each film has its own audience. Until today the war film \"Saving private Ryan\" managed to attract more than 2000 reviews. I guess that the film \"All quiet on the Western front\" draws a somewhat more advanced public. On careful consideration, it is the First World War that appeals most to the imagination when reflecting upon the horrors of war. After WWI war has never again been the same. With \"Im Westen nichts Neues\" Remarque wrote an outstanding account of the misery in the trenches. This is the first try of a cinematic translation, and than there was a remake, in \"The Hallmark Hall of Fame\". Most reviews appreciate the 1930 version, but to me it seems that the remake more closely follows the narrative and the atmosphere of the book. I also found some comments lamenting that it is an English-spoken produce, and so the typical German expressiveness is lost. There is some truth in this critique, and in fact there is a really German counterpart. This is the film \"Westfront 1918\", which was also made in the early thirties and based on a novel (titled \"Vier von der Infantry\"). If you appreciated \"All quiet on the western front\", then \"Westfront 1918\" is definitely a film for you. The main difference between both films is that the German version has an almost documentary style. Both films have a similar main character (resp. Paul Brenner and Karl), but in \"Westfront 1918\" the story line is even thinner. The central theme is war, trenches, barbed wire, death, destruction, and decay. I guess the documentary style of \"Westfront 1918\" was inevitable, since the makers had been in the middle of the conflict and had experienced the horrors by themselves (even on the \"homefront\"). Whereas the American makers of \"All quiet on the western front\" maintain some distance and try to give an interpretation from a personal point of view, the makers of \"Westfront 1918\" can only recount what happened. There is no room for empathy with anything. This makes in my opinion the latter film more impressive and horrific. Therefore I will probably not like \"Saving private Ryan\", since it tries to transform the collective nature of war into an individual affair. Anyway, \"All quiet on the western front\" goes like this. In 1914 Paul Baumer volunteers together with 20 of his classmates. At the front in France they soon discover the gruesome reality. They are confronted with the terrible routine in the trenches. A highly emotional aspect is the proximity of the conflict, since apart from the perpetuating anonymous shelling it is still largely a man-to-man fight with drawn bayonets and experimental flame-throwers. You can yet by accident find yourself in a bomb crater, together with an armed enemy volunteer. It also helps to place the film into the context of military history. In the second half of the nineteenth century the wars were often short encounters between professional armies, which hardly affected the population. However, by the end of the century the rise of imperialism had caused an arms race (something like the Cold War), which stupefied the common people. The mass destruction reached proportions, that surpassed the contemporary human imagination. Man lost what had remained of his innocence. It was this war, that ended the remaining absolute monarchies and even caused the birth of an entirely new society system in Russia. It created the first insane forms of art (Dada), and strongly furthered the foundation of pacifism and the League of Nations.",

Nearly everything mankind can remember about The Great War 1914-18 is derived from the film version of Erich Maria Remarque's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT , the brainwashing of a nation's youth in to joining the army , of having no personal animosity towards the enemy etc . This mindset runs deeply and despite continual factual accounts on the reality of the war such as Gordon Corrigan's Mud Blood and Poppycock the idea that the First World War was for nothing and was nothing more than senseless slaughter of young men remains. Let's put it this way - Is there a difference between Germany invading Belguim in 1914 and Nazi Germany invading Poland in 1939 and if so how is it different ? \n\nOne can see clearly see the case against war and director Lewis Milestone reinforces the anti war aspect to the hilt . The Germans are just like us so much so that they all speak with American accents and have American mannerisms and by trying to make the Germans identifiable to a Hollywood audience he overstates the case and one can't help thinking that perhaps it would have worked better as a silent film though to be fair to the director this would have meant a silent battle sequence where Paul Baumer and his battalion attack the French lines . Despite being made 82 years ago this battle sequence still remains breath taking \n\nOne literary critic argued that the book is not an anti-war novel at all but is instead a celebration of the cult of the soldier . Even if you disagree with this you can see what the critic is saying . In this film version a group of old Germen men violently argue how best to win the war . Later Paul's schoolmaster invites Paul back to class to address the pupils . When Paul gives a lecture that the war is a hell on Earth he is despised for being a traitor .

Some say it is because it was the first 'talkie' to win Best Picture. Others say it is due to the amazing phrase its title is (common admit it is catchy). Yet others still insist it is due to the amazing adaptation of the book it was based on. However, All Quiet on the Western Front is best remembered by me as a gritty and realistic portrayal of a war nearly entirely forgotten.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front follows the story of Paul Baumer, a German teenager who enlists in the army upon the onset of World War One. Along with his classmates, he believes the war will be more of an adventure than a war. That is until they are thrown into the trenches and confronted with the horrors of trench warfare and no mans land. Slowly the many teenage soldiers begin to lose their innocence in this war to end all wars. \n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front is one of those few films that takes us into the lives of a soldier. It does not drop us into some distant battlefield and hold us there until the end. Instead the film gives backgrounds and liveliness to the characters. Everyone is made out to be someone you could run into on the street any day of the week. This is a work of Remarque (the man who wrote the book) and is brought forth perfectly by the actors portraying the characters.\n\nWhat made the book so wonderful was its accurate portrayal and feelings of World War One soldiers. Neither side had a vast majority vicious fighters who sought to destroy the enemy, they were there because that is what their government told them to do. These men were not glorious heroes because of the killing they did but for what they did for each other. The movie (just like the book) shows us that these men are not soldiers but human beings who are trying to survive in the war to end all wars. \n\nAnother upside to the film is its realistic showing of trench warfare. The battle scenes are anything but watered down. The three or four scenes of actual battle are gritty and unnerving. The slaughter shown is accurate to the point of pain when compared to casualty statistics of the First World War (1,058,407 lost at the Battle of the Somme for anyone doubting that). Lewis Milestone paved the way for epic war battles with this film.\n\nLew Ayres is an unknown actor to me. Granted I don't see many films from this time period but I thought his work as the young Paul Baumer was excellent. We literally see him age throughout the film and are easily able to relate to him and understand him. We understand the pain he suffers, we understand the emotions he is feeling all through Ayres fine acting. I hope to come across more of Ayres work in the near future, he was a great actor from what I saw in this movie.\n\nWhile Ayres gives a magnificent performance he is overshadowed by Louis Wolheim who portrays the leader of the bunch, Kat. Wolheim died a year after making this film and to me this was his best work. He is so close to perfection as the battle hardened Kat that it is almost unreal. His acting isn't like the melodramatic work of most actors of this period. It is as if you were watching an actor out of the present day. \n\nThe work other than what is on the screen is marvelous. How the film did not win Best Cinematography is beyond me. It won two Academy Awards and perhaps the two biggest (Director and Picture). Remarque's anti-war classic is brought to life and loyally followed in the film adaptation. All Quiet on the Western Front goes down as one of the earliest war films. It also goes down as one of the most intense, most gruesome, and most brilliant anti-war films I've ever seen. Do not miss this timeless classic.\n\n4.5/5 Stars",

The battle scenes can rival any modern blockbuster for the shear power they convey, the moment when a man is blown up in front of Paul leaving just his hands and wrists on the barbed wire, strong stuff.\n\nIt shows the growing bond between the old hands and new recruits well, especially in the scenes acted by Louis Wolheim, who I think sets the bench mark for the many gruff ugly soldiers, who followed in countless war films, and take the newies under their wing. There are some real moments of tenderness like Paul visiting his friend in hospital and watching him die and the scenes between Paul and his mother.\n\nThat war is stupid we understand, but 75 years ago it was thought of differently by the masses, which makes the success of this film all the more impressive, best film at the Oscars no less.\n\nIt is when Paul gets back to the front after his leave to find the regiment is now made up of 16 year olds, who looked so young, but we were right back at the beginning of the film, they were just like Paul and his classmates, nothing had changed, no lessens had been learnt. Except by us, having watched these children turn into men and die one by one, until finally it is just Paul, we understand that war serves no purpose really, that young lives are lost for what leaders want.

When watching this movie, it is sometimes hard to believe it was released in 1930.\n\nWhile there have been several \"anti-war\" movies released over the years, this is among the first, and it is executed with tremendous effect. The scene that sticks most in my head takes place inside a bunker in the trenches. The shelling, the constant debris falling from the ceiling, the rats, and the men mentally breaking down are all amplified by the claustrophobic camera work.\n\nThe battle sequences are terribly realistic, rivaling those shown in more contemporary films like \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). The mortar explosions very strongly resemble the real thing, such as those shown in World War I archive footage. And the tracking shots of soldiers falling onto barbed wire will leave an indelible impression.\n\nI won't kid around here. This movie is arguably the most violent film of its time. Released before the creation of the infamous Hayes Code, \"All Quiet On the Western Front\" graphically shows hand-to-hand combat, a soldier killed by a mortar shell (with only his dismembered hands remaining), and an agonizing death in the trenches over the course of hours (and the eyes stay open when the man dies). All of these events (and more) were shown from the perspective of a young German soldier named Paul B\u00e4umer. Lew Ayres, who went on to gain fame as Dr. Kildare and then notoriety as a World War II conscientious objector, gives a strong performance as B\u00e4umer.\n\nThis is the second review I have written in which I mention the Hayes Code, and I have no doubt that this movie had at least some influence in its creation. Fortunately for us, Universal Studios felt the subject matter was compelling enough to allow the film to remain basically as-is. Seeing this film makes me wonder what movies would have been like had the Hayes Code not been enforced. Conversely, this particular movie would have been far different if it was produced with the Hayes Code in mind.\n\n\"All Quiet On the Western Front\" is a movie that is ahead of its time, and I think it is among the best movies ever produced and very deserving of its Best Picture win. If you notice it in a video store, or you see it listed on a classic movie channel some time, do yourself a favor: SEE THIS MOVIE!",

They quickly find out that war is a living hell.\n\nOne of the first (and best) anti-war films ever made. It has problems--the sound recording is not that good and the acting is bad--the guys are either overacting or pretty wooden and there is some howlingly bad dialogue. But it still works.\n\nLewis Milestones' direction helps. The battle scenes are long, vicious and pretty graphic (for 1930) and he really makes you feel all the pain and agony the soldiers endure. There are many unforgettable scenes: a young man, his eyes shot out, screaming and stumbling in a battlefield; a young soldier trapped in a crater with a corpse of the enemy; the sequence where the soldiers are being driven mad by nonstop bombing from the enemy and a final scene that packs a real wallop.\n\nIt's also interesting to see flashes of male nudity (this was pre-Code) and Lew Ayres so young and full of life. It's hard to believe such an old film can still work so strongly but this does. I can imagine the impact this had in 1930.\n\nSee the full 130 minute version...avoid the edited 105 minute one.

                "text": "Most of us have probably read a wonderful novel and found ourselves casting a movie version and envisioning how certain scenes would appear on screen. Most of us have probably been disappointed in a movie based of a favorite book.\n\nLewis Milestone's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is in every way equal to Erich Maria Remarque's World War I novel of the same name. Milestone recreates trench warfare in scenes that still have a raw power, with their gut-wrenching depiction of violence and danger, their rodents and dysentery.\n\nHow Paul, the young German soldier who narrates the book, gets to the front lines with his buddies happens quickly in both the novel and the movie. Paul's bellicose schoolmaster has whipped his students into a frenzy over the glories of war and service to one's country. He quotes the famous declaration of the Greek poet Horace, \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.\" The English translation is \"sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country.\" But Professor Kantorek conveniently forgets the lines that follow: \"sweeter it is to live for one's country, and sweeter still to drink of it.\" As the camera pans around the classroom it reveals only little boys, and even viewers who have not read the book know that they will soon be cannon fodder. Before that happens we learn a little about all of them, enough to care when they are gravely wounded or killed. The war makes men out of these boys in only a few weeks.\n\nLew Ayres plays Paul as an Everyman for all the boys in Division 2. The story is told through his eyes as it is in the novel, in a straightforward, highly effective narrative. As Paul, Ayres does some of the best work of his career. The horrors of war, and many are suggested here; speak for themselves. The screenplay is faithful to the spirit of Remarque's novel. Subjective commentary is really superfluous. The film does several things the book can't, one of which is to use slow tracking shots over the trenches. It's a subtle effect unusual for its day. The production design is so vividly detailed it's nearly impossible to believe \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was shot entirely on studio back lots.\n\nIt is only towards the end of the story, when Paul has a lengthy leave and goes home, that he departs from his blunt narrative to ask himself the big questions. He worries if he will be able to live a civilian life, to carve out a career, have a family. His excursion from the front, far away from the constant bombardment of the shells should bring him some respite, some pleasure. But he finds none. And maybe it takes a soldier to understand that a lice-infested redoubt where one false move can leave you holding your intestines in your hands can, in a strange way, feel like home.\n\nMilestone and his screenwriters made a smart move in treating the cast of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" as an ensemble. As the men grow up -- and many of them do survive for two years or more -- it is obvious that these young soldiers have formed attachments of a kind they will never have again even if they live to be old men. When Paul is out on leave and runs into old acquaintances, they ask him \"so, how is it out there?\" What can he tell them? When he drops in on his old Professor he is giving the same rousing call to arms he gave to Paul and his buddies several years earlier. Kantorek wants Paul to echo his sentiments. Paul won't lie, but the truth is impossible to describe.\n\nRarely in the book or the movie are the names of specific battles given. It doesn't matter; they were more or less the same. Visitors to the battlefields of Northern France might be amazed at how much evidence still exists of the trenches and the battle lines like those where Paul and his comrades fought \"The War To End Wars.\" 90 years later, farmers and hikers in the woods still find unexploded bombs (UXBs). Many a farmer tilling his land has been killed by one. If found before they go off, there are three depots in France where UXBs are taken and detonated safely. Children used to decorate fence posts with rusting German and French helmets. Bone fragments were routinely found by anyone working the soil until the 1960s. There is still so much metal in the ground near Verdun that very little green will grow there. And every few months some country loses its last WWI veteran. They are over 100 years old now. How many of their stories mirror those of the men in Paul's Division? Time and the elements are eroding the memories of WWI, but Remarque's story and Milestone's superb film will ensure that they will last, even if their message is never absorbed by any country preparing for war.",

If any movie demonstrated the absurdity of war, this movie does with images and scenes that are unforgettable. Told from the perspective of the Kaiser's army, we follow a school boy and his pals from the class room to the trenches. Initially, an elderly, spectacled, school teacher raves about how they must defend the pride of the fatherland as soldiers can be seen marching outside past the school. \"Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do. Strike with all our power. Give every ounce of strength to win victory before the end of the year. It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again. You are the life of the fatherland, you boys. You are the iron men of Germany. You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy when you are called upon to do so. It is not for me to suggest that any of you should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads. I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom and enlisted in a mass. But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.\" Paul (Lew Ayers) and then his pals encounter the true horrors of war. These horrors include not only the actual battlefield but the devastating horrors on their own side of the battlefield. Later, we watch as our protagonists struggle to make sense out of war and how it started. The most captivating character of the film is Kat (Louis Wolheim) who steals the film. Compared with contemporary films, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" lacks the brutality of war, aside from one shot of two severed hands clinging to a barbed wire fence. Like most memorable war pictures, the action is confined to the trenches with no scenes played out in map rooms as general pontificate about strategy. Milestone would later helm more war movies, including \"The Purple Heart\" (1944), \"A Walk in the Sun\" (1945), \"Halls of Montezuma\" (1950) and \"Pork Chop Hill\" (1959).",

These same boys are all shocked when they finally do get in the war at how loud and ugly it is, and they are forced to grow up real fast as their friends are dying all around them. The story is good, and it looks decent considering when it was made. It is also cool to see when one of the boys who is now a man comes back and sees the teacher that talked him into going, just to find him giving the exact same speech that motivated him to a new class of teens. He is then asked to tell the students all about the glory of war, which he can't and after telling the kids how it really is, they consider him a coward and a traitor.

                "text": "\"You still think it's beautiful to die for your country. The first bombardment taught us better. When it comes to dying for country, it's better not to die at all.\" Indeed a breakthrough in American historical archives, 'All Quiet On The Western Front' (1930) was the first anti-war film of the sound era, faithfully based upon the timeless, best-selling 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque (who also had experienced the war first-hand as a young German soldier). The actual film itself, shot in grainy black and white, truly captures the essence of the time during World War I in the year of 1914, and what the characters are going to be sucked into nonetheless. As the soon-to-be German soldiers are sitting in a classroom being lectured on how great is to die for the country is suddenly drowned out by music being played outside bypassing troops marching their way through the town. The war was indeed on, and the boys sitting in the classroom soon come to the fatal realization that they would very soon be unready become real men who, too, would end up dying for their own country. Was there no other option but to enlist, with the naive boys keeping their fears hidden deep within? Let's take a look. \n\nThe film stars wonderful actors as such who also become central characters. Lew Ayres portrays Paul Baumer, the lead character of a group of seven unknowing boys who are each young, impressionable and are recruited and trained to fight for the glory of their blessed homeland. Ayres was only twenty-one years old when he played Paul in a star-making role. His other friends among the seven were Kropp, Leer and Kemmerick. Also, a shy postman named Himmelstoss, played by John Wray, eventually becomes Sergeant Himmelstoss to the boys when he also enlists. His reputation while in uniform is anything but shy as he angrily barks out orders to his new recruits during training. \n\nIn discussing the history portrayed, it tells the viewer that it was a time near the beginning of twentieth-century Germany where the young men were unready stripped of their innocence to be molded into the ways of becoming a real man because World War I was indeed on. Neither boy knew from another about what truly was about to unfold in the days and hours to come. All they knew were from what they were taught about how gloriously they must defend their fatherland and how wonderful and gallant it was to die for the certain cause. They boys did not know what they were headed into. The future looked bleak and gray; a haunting shadow that hovered over them wherever they seemed to go. They knew that they had to stay together and fight with all they had, even to the death. \n\nIn prevailing attitudes/prejudices, one example would be when Sergeant Himmelstoss is training the new recruits and is making them track through thick, gloppy mud and also marching them for hours in the heat of the day. His attitude towards his regiment was so horrible and demanding that the boys were fed up with it all and decided to pull a prank on the sergeant at night when he would come back to base in a drunken stupor. They made him trip over a long piece of wire and then surround him, put a sack over his head and began kicking him repeatedly in the rear while laughing triumphantly. \n\nIn describing historical accuracy, it probably comes as close as to how the soldiers were dressed in the appropriate uniforms of the time, the weapons that were used, and to where the heat of the battle of World War I is on full throttle. The young recruits are reduced to standing in damp, muddy trenches encompassed by other soldiers as missiles whistle their deadly note through the air and as bullets rampaging from machine guns portray rhythmic timing with the cries of death. The world the boys had once known was now leveled down to a barren wasteland infested with horrible images and darkened skies choked in the thick smog of war. Some parts were saddening, including one memorable scene where Paul visits his wounded, dying friend Kemmerick lying in pain in the dying room in the makeshift crowded hospital in a French cathedral. Only nineteen years old, he is afraid of what is going to happen to him. He complains to Paul that there are robbers amidst the place, saying that they have stolen his watch. He even wonders about the pain in every toe on his right foot, which, unknowingly to him, has been amputated. When he discovers that not just his foot but his whole leg is gone, he breaks down and utters a startled cry that fills the place, emanating his sorrow and loss. Shortly after this, he dies. Other scenes were downright gruesome, as soldiers are running across the field being blown to bits. Even in one graphic scene evoking surprise and disgust was of a soldier clinging on to a fence. An explosion followed, swallowing him in fire and smoke. When the dust had settled, all that remained of him were his bloodied hands still gripping the meshes of the fence. There is a scene at the end where Paul reaches out his hand for a butterfly on the field and is immediately shot. This portrays to the viewer that true innocence is stripped clean amidst the terrors of war. \n\nThis spectacular film was a great experience to reflect upon and to thoroughly enjoy. Made on a large-scale budget of only $1.25 million and with an employment of over two-thousand extras, this film went on to win four Academy Awards nominations. A mastery war film from a mastery filmmaker, and a true milestone for the eponymous director!",

Though it is nearly a century old right now the sheer amount of creativity in this is simply mind blowing. Maybe looking at the long journey the cinema has come up to now from the time this movie was made comparatively the key point that comes to my mind is that 'not much improvement'. Because in a world where we believe that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece (It is no doubt) of war cinema All Quite on the Western Front (AQWF) has done it in a magnitude beyond its time and that's some mind boggling truth to realize. \n\nThe background of the movie is based on a set of teenagers who joins the German army on the first year of World War 1. Thought they are still very young and attending to school the motivation they received through their school professor make them want to fight for their country. However they realize that the true face of war is brutal, unforgiving and severely stressful than the picture they received of it back at home. On blood, sweat and dead bodies they struggle to survive one day at a time seeing the devastation of war getting heftier by the night. While the story follows several individuals in a group the key character is Paul B\u00e4umer who finally gets to return home after getting injured. But once he come back which is after 3 years from being in the front line he realizes that the place he call home is not what it used to be. And he becomes a stranger amongst the people of his home town. \n\nAQWF is based on a German novel (Im Westen nichts Neues) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The movie is directed by Lewis Milestone. The storyline is very effective in terms of depicting the mentality of the soldiers who are fighting in the front lines and how the hardships of the circumstances break them. Lack of food, long hours on duty, fear of death, being homesick, losing their mates are all taking a toll on their motivation and ultimately the significance of their existence is lost. But the courage these young men show staring at death day in and day out is not to be underestimated. The other key point which made AQWF on top of my war movie list is the cinematography. Right from the start the details the movie concentrates upon is magnificent. In an age where CG was not heard of most of the scenes have being staged live and that must have being a tremendous effort from the whole crew. And there is one astonishing battle sequence that runs for a whole of 8 minutes nonstop and by the end of it the viewer will be sweating for sure. \n\nThe true beauty of AQWF is how the director mixes up the selfless war and the humans full of emotions in to one. This mix ultimately proves that wars are fought by ordinary people in extraordinary situations and their lives are just as valuable no matter what side they fight for. But on the battle ground that is the only thing that seems to have no value and it's devastating. No war can be justified.",

The director Lewis Milestone served in the Great War and brings great visuals to the battle scenes and profound sorrow for those dealing with their injuries either physical, mental or both.\n\nIf there is criticism, sometimes its not clear what the injuries to the men are. This might to do with the fact that the scenes are non graphic reflecting period the film was made. Many a time it seems the soldiers died from what looked like a minor injury.\n\nStill this is an important war film in the history of cinema.",

It is impactful, poignant, relevant even to this day and there is no mistaking it's overall message.\n\nI truly wish I could rate this movie higher, and if it was produced only a few years before of after 1930 I likely would have. The film fell right into the middle of the transition between talkies and silent films(there were even parallel versions made for theaters that didn't have sound yet), and this is plainly evident on screen. But should I really hold this against the movie, or rather concentrate on what was achieved in-spite of it? And the achievement was considerable indeed. \"All Quiet...\" stands today as one of the most memorable war movies of all time. The action scenes do a fantastic job of illustrating the near futility of trench warfare. The evolution and growth of the main character of Paul, as played by Lew Ayres, from naive schoolboy to battle hardened soldier is one of the best in cinema history.\n\nPerspective. That is where this movie truly shines. We get to see the war from the perspectives of schoolboys being recruited(almost goaded)into the war effort. The soldiers on the front lines both experienced and fresh out of boot camp. The old men back home arguing over their maps, completely removed from the realities of modern warfare. The families left behind and the civilians caught in the middle of two armies. As I said already there is no mistaken the anti-war message of the film but it is in the presentation of all the various points-of-views and the impact that war has on ordinary people where it shines.\n\nIn so the movie manages to rise above the technical issues and natural grow pains that movie makers experienced during this time.

This was reflected in the movies of the time, a trend which reached its peak with this 1930 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's novel All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nAn early sound movie, All Quiet on the Western Front features technical feats that, according to some, weren't possible in the first talkies, especially extensive camera movement and outdoor shooting. Director Lewis Milestone it seems couldn't do without having his camera on the go, and All Quiet on the Western Front incidentally contains some of the most graceful examples from his entire career. We open with a crane-shot zooming over a parade of troops and in through a classroom window over the heads of students \u0096 a neat and engaging introduction to the movie. There was also a great deal of experimentation with new technology around this point, some of it very effective, such as the juxtaposing of the teacher's voice over the montage of student's imaginings of army life. Milestone's big thing for this movie however is placing the viewer inside the combat, with some dynamic trench-bound point-of-view shots. Importantly, Milestone stages these scenes with a cleverly-orchestrated chaos that eventually makes it nearly impossible to tell one side from the other.\n\nBut All Quiet on the Western Front is not without a few flaws common to the era. In particular the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Lew Ayres is horribly overwrought, and yet he is still the best of the lead actors. Some of the supporting players seem a little more realistic, but only because they don't have to emote. It's when people get angry or upset in this movie that all credibility goes out of the window. And some scenes feel rather awkwardly constructed and overlong even when they are fairly short. One example of this is the bit when Ayres comforts a French soldier he has fatally stabbed in a shell hole, which was presumably a moving moment in the novel, but here seems stilted and corny.\n\nStill, the movie's haunting imagery and clear point-making have made it the touchstone anti-war picture down the generations. However, despite its initial critical and commercial success, its popularity would wax and wane along with attitudes to war, and it would be rarely seen in the gung-ho 40s and 50s. The tendency continues to this day. In 1998 All Quiet on the Western Front was #54 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years\u0085 100 Movies\" list. When the list was revised in 2007, post-9/11 and post-Iraq war, it did not appear at all.",

This threw me off, because I had anticipated a talking film, but once I learned there were several versions I shrugged it off and watched the film.\n\nRemembrance Day (Canadian) is an important day to me, a history fanatic. I believe it's so important to not forget what previous generations have done for us. So All Quiet on the Western Front's message of peace seemed fitting to watch on this special day. \n\nIt is important to realize what the world was like when this was made. The Great War had ended only 12 years ago, and WWII had not occurred, and in 1930 it wasn't even really on anyone's horizon. 1929 was the start of the Great Depression, and when this film was made. It was also the time when silent films transitioned into talkies. This film was a big gamble- tough topic, big budget, large cast, and it all paid off.\n\n'All Quiet' is a visual representation of Grade 10 History. Everything I learned about WWI is present in this film: propaganda at home, peer pressure, poor, unexpected conditions, trenches, mud, loss: but this was new to the people of 1930. So while a viewer now won't be so shocked, they would've been 80 years ago. But 'All Quiet' nails the visual aspect of life in the War.\n\nWe follow a group of German schoolboys, as they sign up and find out about the horror of war. Through the first half, they are a collective, but eventually the film focuses on Paul. Lew Ayres crafted a character that affected his life. We see a boy become a man, and then the shell of a man.\n\nI found some sections to be a tad over-dramatic, like the hospital scene with the boots. It just went on and on, and it didn't help there was lots of dialogue and few cards of words.\n\nBut 'All Quiet' is best, and most heart-wrenching when everyone stops talking and we see battle. The first real fight we see, after days of shelling, is one of the most nauseating fights ever. And for its time, easily the most violent. The massive scale, the incredibly accurate battlefield, the sheer number of men- it's unbelievable. Seeing the machine gunner mowing down people in a single camera shot, seeing a man disappear with only his hands attached to wire- it's downright upsetting and one of the most epic battles ever. No amount of talk can emphasize a message like dramatic reenactments of trench warfare. And then, when the allies jump into the trenches, the guns go away, the bayonets go away- and the shovels come out. I hate to make this comparison, but Saving Private Ryan wouldn't be possible without this film to pave the way.\n\nSome may be turned off by its age, but 'All Quiet' is one of the earliest essential films, and maybe the earliest essential war film. It absolutely deserves its accolades. The message, always relevant, and the ending, always shattering, create an amazing tragic drama that is a very important viewing. 8.5/10",

As the war drags on in the disease-plagued trenches of Europe, the youths come face to face with the cruelty of war.

                "text": "The original anti-war film and visualization of the Remarque novel. If this doesn't make you hate war, it is safe to say that nothing will. I watched the remake of '79 before this, and that allows me to draw comparisons(something which the high quality of both films demands). Certain decisions were made in the case of either film being produced; creative calls. Both versions have something that the other doesn't. On the whole, I'd say that this includes more of the most important scenes, apart from two major decisions(in the field of editing and revealing of information... how much the audience is allowed to know and at what point) at the end. Also, one scene close to the end wasn't included in this one, and it proved to be powerful in the later version. The plot is great, and it evolves at an excellent speed. The pacing, in general, works much better than that of the latter film. It's dreary when that works in the context of what's going on, intense when it needs to be and you're never bored. I couldn't take my eyes off the film for a single second. The acting is for the very most part exceptional, though there is some noticeable overacting(almost certainly due to the fact that this was so soon after sound came to movies... the actors simply weren't that accustomed to speaking yet). It hurts the film a little bit, but it's easily ignored. As is the comedic aspect of the film, which is just a tad too dominant and bears evidence of the humor of the time(that of The Three Stooges and the likes), though it does harm the serious tone some(if only slightly). The film is amazing. The effects are incredible. There's no Hollywood in this; no fireball explosions and no heroes. Just realistic effects and real people. The tone is bleak and unpleasant. This comes as close to how real war must feel like as is possible through the film medium(at the very least at the time it was made). The battle scenes are noisy, chaotic and unsettling. The time spent in a bunker is claustrophobic and echoes of uncertainty... what will come next? The writing is fantastic. Though lacking the story-telling crutch of voice-over narration that the later-produced film utilized, the points are made perfectly and the story well-told. The cinematography and editing are practically flawless, and work astoundingly well. The details are magnificent, so much is covered herein. I cannot help but admire the sheer amount of planning that went into this. All in all, I'd rate this a bit higher than the remake... but I urge for anyone watching one to watch the other and decide for themselves. Both are marvelous films, and both have something that the other lacks. As an anti-war film, as a piece of well-rounded film-making, and as an accurate and effective account of war, I consider this the superior of the two. The other has more steady acting and better build-up of some important plot points(the human beauty in the main character, most noticeably). I recommend that anyone who has the chance and who believes that they have the fortitude to sit through such strong and painful films watches both. Not to be missed. 9/10",

                "text": "Every bit as meaningful as it was when it was first released over 75 years ago, this examination of the horrors of war is an eye-opening piece of movie-making for those who are used to the routine, almost-sterile, gung-ho war films that came after it (until a relaxation in censorship began leading to more realistic treatments of military carnage on screen.) Set in WWI Germany, it follows the enlistment, training and wartime experience (and in most cases, eventual death) of a group of young men, egged on to volunteer by their rather fanatical teacher. The bulk of the attention is given to Ayres, in a star-making role, who plays the most thoughtful, even-keeled member of the group. After envisioning all sorts of idealized perks and prestiges associated with becoming soldiers and war heroes, the cold reality sets in soon after the boys enlist. Their former postman is now a stern drill instructor, their personal comfort, including clothing, bedding and meals, matters not one bit to the German army and they are worked over continually in order to turn them into emotionless fighting machines. Once into battle, the men are practically overcome by the inherent hardships and torments of their daily lives. A hardened sergeant (Wolheim) takes some of them under his wing along with his sidekicks, burly Alexander and amusingly discontented Summerville. However, death and injury come swiftly and without warning to many of the recruits. The film is astonishing if for no other reason that it accomplishes so much visually and thematically despite being made in 1930, when sound film was in its infancy and camera movement was stifled by the process of recorded sound having to be put in synch with the pictures. No music score is heard after the opening credits, adding an eerie realism to the proceedings and allowing the endless shells and firepower to provide background noise. (Speaking of backgrounds, there is nearly always something occurring in the backgrounds of the film; passing trucks, marching soldiers, etc... giving the film an urgency that others sometimes lack.) There are many memorable sequences including a claustrophobic stint in a crumbling bunker, a face-to-face killing along with the emotional fall-out from it, a playful diversion of skinny-dipping and romance with a trio of French girls, a pair of decidedly unlucky leather boots and, of course, the unforgettable final minutes. The battle sequences here are startlingly realistic with all the dirt, grime, explosions, gunfire, hand-to-hand combat and graphic injury right there on the screen. The frank approach to sexuality and the carefree handling of semi-nudity will surely be a surprise to viewers used to films from 1934 to the 1950's. It makes one wonder how cinema would have progressed without the shackles of stringent censorship just after the beginning of the sound era. Though he isn't first billed, Ayres is really the leading man of the picture and is an appealing presence. He (and many others in the cast) can't quite shake some of the mannerisms and acting styles that were used in the silent films, but this isn't hard to overlook after a while. Top-billed Wolheim does an excellent job. His performance is as accessible now as it was then. Sadly, he died of cancer not too long after this film was released. Gleason, a beautifully handsome young actor who plays one of Ayres' cohorts had an unfortunate accident in 1945, ending his life. Mercer, who plays Ayres worried mother, was also felled within a few years of the film. Summerville, a lanky actor known more for his comic roles, appeared in the much lesser known sequel \"The Road Back\" in 1937. Once seen, the film's message that war is hell isn't easily shaken. The film benefits from a repeat viewing in order to fully digest the sizable cast of young men and watch their stories unfold.",

This captures World War 1 far better than any film about the war. Probably because the director was a veteran, and the film extras were all real German soldiers. Because of those two respects it gives the viewer a greater sense of the anti-war feelings associated with World War 1. You watch as Paul Baumer's friends slowly die off one by one until he's the last one. And when he reaches out for the butterfly at the end and is felled by sniper fire, we are sorry that he is dead. But also relieved that he met a quick and painless death unlike many of his friends. And when he returns home on leave and talks to the old men who know nothing of war or of the situation who practically scold Baumer for correcting them, almost makes the viewer want to shout at the screen to set them straight. But the most heart wrenching sequence was when the camera focused on the boots as he went from taking them from his dead friend, on the march, through combat in the trenches and finally his death. That was beautifully shot. Overall I'd recommend this movie to anyone who can overlook the films age, but I say this to everyone: the age doesn't matter! The message is still fresh and useful.",

In the early days of \"talkies\",the first motion pictures with sound,a lot of film-makers chose the musical (like 1929's \"Braodway Melody\".) They also did comedy,to which a lot of silent comics lost their gravy train. Silent actors too.\n\n\"All Quiet On The Western Front\" is not just a great war movie,it's also a great \"anit-war\" movie and for the time a daring and bold choice. So great are the scenes of the young men in the classroom upon graduation day,being given a speech by their mentor. A speech about school being over and their \"duty\" beginning,in terms of joining the German military andfighting against the French \"for their Kaiser\",then ruler of Germany in 1916.\n\nThey all go out and join up and one way or another,the war destroys them. Physically or mentally they are either killed in battle or lose their mind and can no longer be the people they once were. The over all message I came away with,is not just the usual \"war is insanity\",I also find the message that one's duty begins with a duty to one's own self and not what others feel it to be.\n\nHad this movie been attempted after the \"censorship reign\" in Hollywood,it most likely would not have been allowed. This movie won Best Picture of 1930 for all the reasons a film should win. A great subject,great story,great acting and a great,first rate drama in the new era of talking pictures. \n\n(END)",

But after experiencing brutal training at the hands of the unassertive,ignorant, and authoritarian Corporal Himmelstoss and the inconceivable brutality of life on the front,Paul and his friends start to question the value of nationalism and patriotism. Thay start to ask how the war started anyway and who the major provoker of this meaningless brutality was?Among the monotony of the artillery fire,the difficulty of finding some decent food,their pushing their luck for fleeing from the inescapable death shows them they are fighting the war for a few persons whom they have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends. The movie displays the brutality of the war not by means of one-to-one combat in the field. The director regularly shows the bombardment fields and how soldiers are trying to flee from their death not they are running to fight.The after-amputation scenes in which soldiers presume that their legs just hurt as if they really had their legs,the difficulty of finding food in the dugouts surrounded by artillery bombardments,the struggle to survive in the trenches depict the cruelties of war and how these soldiers are disconnected from emotions like grief,benignancy,and fear and each being turned into a robotic mechanism who tries to survive under these circumstances.\n\nThe bombardment scenes in the movie are purely realistic even by today's standards.To shot such warfare scenes which look realistic even today must require a lot of cinematic skills but the acting is merely melodramatic and gushy at some points like Paul's crying out \"Oh Albert I've come back\". The soldiers who are supposed to be isolated from their humanly emotions are not supposed to display such acting I suppose.It just spoils the perfection of the movie. That's only fault I could see in the movie.One note for those who both read the book and saw the movie: Definitely read the sequel of the book: The Road Back which details the post-bellum life of young men in Germany who have returned from the trenches of World War I and are trying to sort their life out back into the society.",

As other users have commented, it's amazing that this story of men at war was made at a time when the majority of Hollywood's output was designed to transport movie-goers away from grim reality. \n\nIt's also remarkable for portraying a recent enemy as a human being rather than a racial stereotype. Despite his German uniform, Paul Baumer could be from any country involved in World War I. His experiences in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" were certainly shared by the soldiers on either side of No Man's Land.\n\nThere are other anti-war movies that deal with the attempted de-humanisation of those who are trained to kill and the sheer horror of modern mechanised warfare, but this film is one of the first and there are few that can ever equal it. Perhaps, as other users have said, this is because the people who made it were so deeply affected by the experience of the Great War. \n\nThe power of the film could also be due to the power of its source material.

Out came the tune \"Kingdom Coming.\"  This is a rarely seen cartoon and the version on the Disney Channel is censored (a scene of Tom Cat drinking at the beginning of the short).  There really wasn't much action to it, but it was okay.",

WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY is hands down the least entertaining short in the Mickey Mouse series up to this point. While there are a few cute moments scattered around, the overall feel of the film just makes you think that Walt Disney was in a rush to get something into theaters so this was thrown together. I say that because there's really nothing too funny here as we see Mickey and his friends playing music and that's it. Heck, you'd think that for some adventure or fun that Tom Cat would come back and catch them but that never happens. The score is nice and the animation is good but there's just not too much here.",

I suspect this short goes a long way towards explaining just why Ub Iwerks came a cropper when he separated from Disney to run his own studio. Plots weren't all that significant in his shorts.\n\nThe cat leaves to go hunting for the day, downing a jug of moonshine before he leaves. A shotgun and a drunken cat might have been interesting to watch in itself, but we get mice cavorting in the cat's home. Mice are utilized in a few innovative ways, as keys, phonographs and so on. Mickey and Minnie dance across piano keys as normal sized mice for a change.\n\nOne correction to an error in another comment here.

Starting with what I didn't like so much, the story is practically non-existent, and seemed more an excuse to run interlude after interlude, that gets tiresome after a while. The animation is not bad actually, but nothing really stands out, other Mickey cartoons showed things like Mickey's frustration etched in his features that made you feel for him, but there isn't much of that here. There are also times where you felt the quality of the backgrounds could have been smoother. The cat is not really a compelling character either, the rats and Mickey and Minnie are far more likable and developed, for a title character the cat seemed just there, making his role pointless. It was almost as if the cartoon was meant to be another idea that was dropped. The music score is also not bad, it is energetic and characterful but it has been more subtly used before, here there are occasions where it is somewhat crude. On the other hand, Mickey and Minnie are both likable characters, and their friends are equally sweet. There are some good gags as well, the best three being the Kingdom Coming gag with the rats turning themselves into a record player, Mickey using one of the rats as a key to unlock the door and how his tail picks him up as he was about to fall into the mousetrap. Another nice touch is the rats marching in whistling the same melody that the cat did as he marches away. On the whole, a decent cartoon but a long way from great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

The cat's gone and in his absence, the mice run amok in the home--dancing about and enjoying themselves.

                "text": "This is an important silent film from Germany made in the last year before the advent of sound films. It was the last silent film written and directed by Maurice Tourneur, who was born in Paris and was an assistant to the sculptor Rodin when young. The cinematography, shots, and atmosphere, are all eerie and haunting, creating a continuous mood of menace and threat. Half way through the film, Marlene Dietrich (aged 28) appears. She is very effective, but she doesn't really look like Marlene Dietrich. That was all to come soon enough, and the change wrought in her persona after her 'discovery' later the same year by Josef von Sternberg may clearly be appreciated by seeing her in this last film when she was still someone else. This is a brooding, languorous portrait of a sailing ship with a wicked captain and a murderous crew. Just before the ship is due to sail to Brazil (from Germany), a voyage of three months, it is discovered that the first mate is missing. Someone goes to collect him from the local seafront bar where he is expected to be drunk, and haul him back. However, he has been badly beaten up and a young American doctor who is on a European tour offers to help, by bandaging the first mate's injuries. He then reluctantly helps to carry the man to the rowboat and is rowed out to the sailing ship at anchor, helping also to carry the injured man aboard, where he then gives him a last bit of medical attention. Suddenly he looks through the porthole and sees that the ship is moving! He rushes up to the deck, and there is a wonderful receding tracking shot as he goes along the deck vainly trying to speak to some of the sailors and protest that he needs to leave the ship. They are all so preoccupied with the duties of hoisting sails and tending to the rigging that they wholly ignore him. This is a very effective and 'modernist' scene, similar to the much more recent use of simultaneously spoken dialogue between people who are not properly listening to each other but merely hurling monologues at each other, which has occasionally been used both on film and on the stage. Here we have a desperate man trying to find someone to listen to him and they don't even take any notice of him. It is like a dream sequence where you are stuck in the mud and cannot move. The captain refuses to let him off, so he is stuck. This young doctor is played by a handsome and impressive British actor named Robin Irvine, who died at only 31 (I haven't been able to discover how or why), who had earlier starred with Ivor Novello in 'Downhill' (1927), which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Another interesting characterisation is of Grischa the Cook, an always-smiling and good-natured fellow, played excellently by Vladimir Sokoloff, a well-known character actor born in Moscow who acted in 111 films. There are some wonderful sequences in this film. When Irvine and Sokoloff, sitting in the kitchen, look out through a porthole, they see the tail of an airplane sticking up out of the sea! From this wreck Irvine saves Marlene Dietrich, a New York heiress who has been trying to fly the Atlantic solo but had an oil leak and crashed. She has to be hidden from the crew, who have a serious testosterone problem. Then there is a mutiny because the captain is so horrible everybody wants to kill him, so he is thrown overboard and we see a shot obviously taken from a small boat of him doing a desperate breaststroke in the sea with his ship sailing off without him, so that one inevitably thought of Robert Maxwell. An escapee from prison, who is a hardened criminal, then takes over the ship as captain, and at that point Dietrich is discovered. A sinister dinner takes place where he opens some champagne and eyes her with a certain something in mind. Dietrich is particularly good in this scene, avoiding the clich\u00e9 of the maiden-in-danger or the simpering innocent, and handles it all with great calm and maturity as she tries to master her terror and avoid his gaze while appearing unperturbed. All hells breaks loose, the crew break open the wine cellar and get drunk, and chaos reigns in this ship of ghouls. The new captain tries to murder Irvine, so that he can rape Dietrich, and it all gets worse and worse. They have changed course for Spain, where they expect landfall in three days. But can anyone survive that long? Then unexpectedly a cruise ship is seen. Here we have many surreal shots of a vast brightly-lit ocean liner which hoves to beside the sailing ship and turns its searchlights on it because the little cook had sent distress signals with a flashing light. Ladies in evening dress and men in dinner jackets line the railings and peer down upon the strange sight below them. At first the deck is deserted except for a single man who is gloriously drunk and waving his arms in every direction as he lies on his back like a stranded drunken baby. The captain of the liner calls out over a megaphone and slowly the vermin emerge into view, though some are dead from a gunfight. While all this is going on above, Dietrich is cornered below decks and things could not be more desperate, as her clothes are being pulled off. Will she be saved? Or is this going to be one of those films that ends in a 'downer'? Irvine has been beaten to a pulp. Is he dead? How will this harrowing film end? Will anyone be brought to justice? Or will the liner pull away into the night leaving the lost ship to its 'lost men'?",

                "text": "After learning about the importance of Maurice Tourneur in the history of cinema (and making the connection between images of \"La main du diable\" and its creator) I have watched a few of his silent and sound films, which were remarkable works for their times and still impressive in ours. A recent viewing was his film adaptation of a novel by Greek author Frenzos Kerzemen (or Franzos Keremen, as listed here). It was the beginning of Tourneur's third and last phase of his career as director, when he returned to his native France, after growing dissatisfied with the kind of films made by American big studios. Without reading the novel, it is difficult to know if the plot follows the literary work or if it was changed by Tourneur in his screenplay, for in the end it turns into a rose-colored endorsement of bourgeois respectability, after the striking first two acts taking place in a German sea port, in New York and almost entirely aboard the title ship. According to conventions of dramatic action, none of the characters really change the way we usually refer to alterations in life or manner: there are few radical actions or signs of profound change of perspective in all characters. Everything is mostly done under control, even when the story told is the most violent. American doctor William Cheyne (handsome British actor Robin Irvine, who died young at 32) is arguably the protagonist, the traditional hero and savior, while the fugitive convict Morains (Gaston Modot, who would become an immortal icon of crazy love in Bu\u00f1uel's \"L'age d'or\") is his nemesis. Ethel Marley (Marlene Dietrich) is an American socialite in distress, who crashes her plane in the Atlantic Ocean and is rescued by Dr. Cheyne, falling in love; and Grischa (Vladimir Sokoloff) is the cook of the ship, who will play a key role in the resolution. What they go through, as scripted by Tourneur and beautifully photographed by Nicolas Farkas, is startling. Morains asks Captain Fernando Vela (Fritz Kortner) to take him to Brazil in his ship Galatea. Vela (a mean villain too) specializes in helping fugitive smugglers, pirates, killers, thieves, convicts and the like to get out of Germany. They become his crew and he treats them really bad until they reach their destiny. Dr. Cheyne joins the Galatea by accident, when he goes to the ship to help a wounded sailor, without noticing when it weighs anchor. Next Ethel secretly comes aboard, then Cap. Vela's pet is killed, the crew revolts against him and after the mutiny a chain of events follows, motivated by lust, greed, hatred and pure vileness. After these scenes the third act comes as a sort of sell-out: I personally would have preferred to see the few decent characters find a resolution inside the ship, not with outside help, but considering that so many crooks were put together in a single set, it is somehow understandable. A long film, running more than two hours, it gives space to actors to find gestures, gazes and expressions to tell the story without the need of many intertitles, while the viewer has more time to appreciate the magnificent images created by Farkas and Tourneur, who would go on to make a few more masterpieces before his retirement.

Director Maurice Tourneur obviously had an enormous budget at his disposal and has spared no expense in bringing this dark story to the screen. A \"film noir\" if ever there was one, a great deal of the movie is set in the shadows -- shadows which are brilliantly contrasted with the rescue ship's piercing lights. The sets too are all cleverly designed to highlight this same contrast between Good and Evil. Until he is overthrown, Fritz Kortner dominates the movie as the utterly inhuman captain, a Lucifer in a hell of devils.\n\nWe keep waiting for Dietrich and wondering how on earth she will fit into the story, until she finally appears. She then becomes the center of our attention, pushing the nominal hero, somewhat bland Robin Irvine, further into the sidelines. As for Vladimir Sokoloff, he has an important role to play at the climax, but he is not all that active in the rest of the film. In fact, we wonder why some half-baked American publicist titled the movie, \"Grischa the Cook\", instead of translating the German title, \"The Ship of Lost Men\" or using a title that would highlight Dietrich's role. She certainly bears watching, In fact she is wonderful in what is actually a character role!",

As you might expect, it is a dark film and quite explicit in its portrayal of aggressive male sexuality. In one scene, a sailor draws a chalk picture of the woman with exaggerated bosom and angel wings, leaving no doubt as to what he and his shipmates have in mind when they get their hands on her. The ending is a happy one, but not until Dietrich has been brutally attacked by the leader of the mutineers in a startlingly realistic fight scene.

                "text": "\nThis, the second cinematic version of THE BEST PEOPLE, a play by Avery Hopwood and David Gray that was first staged in 1924 and filmed in 1925, is a period piece that glides over the best efforts of time, its serio-comic point of view intact, a smartly paced affair presenting a strong opportunity for role development beneath its frothy Roaring Twenties backdrop.  Paramount casts new contractee Miriam Hopkins for her film debut as wealthy Marian Lenox, along with Charles Starrett as her chauffeur and beau, Carole Lombard ( the \"e\" was added by a title scribbler for this film), Frank Morgan and whimsical Ilka Chase, all in top form, whilst Preston Sturges reconditions an already witty storyline.  The setting is Long Island, where the Lenox clan resides, and where agitation reigns due to prospects of the family's adult son and daughter marrying below their station (to a chauffeur and a chorus girl), culminating with the entire family unintentionally meeting at a roadhouse speakeasy, whereupon a police raid adds to the growing embarrassment and consternation for two generations of Lenox family members.  The film is smartly directed, and acted with verve by all cast members, Hopkins a lively delight and reliable Morgan as solid as ever, although it is Broadway standout Chase who steals acting honours with her uninhibited performance, each benefiting from the pungent dialogue of Sturges that maintains an airy tone for a sophisticated romp, this version topping its silent screen predecessor in all elements except for Warner Baxter's memorable playing of the prideful and lovelorn chauffeur. \n",

She calls it off so that she can spend her time with Henry (Charles Starrett), a mechanic. This is too much for Marion's mother, Carrie (Winifred Harris) who is a socially aspiring nightmare of a woman. Carrie is dealt another blow when her son, Bertie (Henry Wadsworth) announces his intention to marry a chorus girl Alice (Carole Lombard). Marion's father, Bronson (Frank Morgan) plays the voice of reason and engineers a happy ending.\n\nThis film belongs to Miriam Hopkins. Whenever she is on screen you are never far from a quality insult, especially in the scenes with Charles Starrett when they go swimming at night. She effortlessly insults him and it's great fun to watch. Unfortunately, he is a bit of a lughead and comes nowhere near the level of acting competency or talent that is demonstrated by Hopkins. He is just a big, stupid guy who likes cars. Carole Lombard hardly has a thing to do and is upstaged by her companion, Millie (Ilka Chase). The film is funny and moves at a good pace. It's the usual boy v girl story where we know what is going to happen and it's fun to watch how they get there.",

                "text": "In the midst of the Great Depression films often focused on the antics of the idle rich, with the best of these being made at Paramount. This film is about a wealthy family that is thrown into chaos when the son wants to marry a chorus girl (Carole Lombard) and the daughter (Miriam Hopkins) wants to marry a mechanic (Charles Starrett). Even though Carole Lombard is second billed in this film, she is practically a statue here -beautiful to look at, but having only a line here and there. This is really Miriam Hopkin's film as Marion Lenox, and she does a great job as the poor little rich girl that doesn't know what she wants until she meets the man of her dreams that turns out to be the family's newly hired mechanic. Frank Morgan plays his part as the father, Bronson Lenox, with all the befuddled flair we've come to expect from him. The whole film comes to a head when Bronson and his brother meet the chorus girl fianc\u00e9e of Bronson's son at a roadhouse intending to convince the chorus girl to leave his son alone. Unfortunately Bronson's son shows up at the same roadhouse that night as well as Bronson's daughter with the mechanic in tow. There is a big scene between all involved that is only interrupted by a raid on the establishment.\n\nIlke Chase, as Carole Lombard's close friend and fellow chorus girl, is a great comic touch. The story calls for Carole's character to be sober and responsible, so Ilke is added as a counter to all of that. She physically resembles 30's Warner character actor Aline McMahon, but she has the wildness of all of the Gold Diggers of 1933 rolled into one with Winnie Lightner thrown in for good measure. Her vamping of Bronson Lenox's emotionally embalmed brother is hilarious.\n\nOne of the forerunners of the screwball comedies of the 1930's, ironically Miriam Hopkin's part here reminds me a bit of the part that Carole Lombard plays in 1936's \"My Man Godfrey\". Very entertaining and highly recommended if you run across this one.",

Frank Morgan is the wealthy patriarch of this family where his son and daughter both find love with partners Morgan is suspicious of. \n\nMiriam Hopkins is the leading lady as Morgan's daughter, falling in love with a noble mechanic (Charles Starrett) while her more irresponsible younger brother (Henry Wadsworth) falls in love with the pretty chorus girl Carole Lombard whom Morgan believes is a gold digger. Delightfully stagy, this is one of the best early sound comedies and features some great lines and a terrifically sassy performance by stage legend on Ina Claire as an eccentric friend of the families. \n\nLombard has very few scenes, but it's very interesting to see her in several of those with fellow blonde Miriam Hopkins in her very first film. Lombard had been around for a couple of years but was working her way up bit by bit. This film assured her place as one of Paramount's brightest stars, and she shows a penchant for comedy that she wouldn't get to do for a few more years. \n\nMorgan is far from the flibberty- gibbit character that he would play in many of his later films, and it is a reminder that he had started off his acting career in more serious parts. The last scene brings everything together all very nicely with the truth of who each of the major characters are being revealed and Morgan making surprising discoveries as to what class really is.",

Conrad Veidt excels as the kindly Erik the Great who finds his soon to be bride has fallen in love with one of his assistants. The discovery scene is a superb piece of acting from Veidt, as he shifts from shock to heartbreak, struggling to be magnanimous, and then gradually to cold calculation with the subtlest changes of expression.\n\n\nThese moments and a dynamic trial scene elevate what is otherwise an okay backstage melodrama into a truly compelling tale of jealousy and redemption. Palo Fejos, director of the wonderful \"Lonesome\", injects some stylish visuals.\n\nThe version I've seen is a truncated and mute print of 48 minutes, so I may have missed some of the film's finer points.

                "text": "Universal was enamored of setting stories in the theater, weren't they? Perhaps \"Phantom of the Opera\" set the precedence. \"The Last Warning\" featured a masked murderer terrorizing Broadway. \"The Last Performance\" sets a love triangle among a magic act. Once again, Mary Philbin plays the object of desire of a murderous older man. While \"Phantom\" had obvious grotesque attributes and \"The Last Warning\" was basically an old dark house mystery, \"The Last Performance\" is a melodrama with light fantastic elements.\n\nThe story is typical. Erik the Great, a stage magician and hypnotist, is in love with Julie, his female assistant. He plans to marry the girl as soon as she turns eighteen, a story turn likely to gross out modern audiences. Julie only has eyes for Mark, a vagabond that Erik takes under his wing. \"The Last Performance\" neatly follows the three-act structure, with Erik discovering the truth about his love at the 18 minute point, the \"seven swords through the box\" magic trick going predictably wrong half-way through, and the last act set during a trial, with the case-solving testimony serving as a concise climax.\n\nOf most interest to horror fans is Conrad Veidt's performance. Veidt was made for the silents. He says so much with simply a shift of his brow, expressing heart-break or jealousy with only his face. Despite the temptation to compare the two, Erik the Great isn't Erik the Phantom. He's not a monster, rather a fair man who commits wrong only out of love. The hypnotism sequences make great use of his glaring eyes. No wonder Veidt was nearly Dracula. Conrad's performance alone makes the sappy finale believable. The rest of the cast is thin, with Mary Philbin making goo-goo eyes at Fred MacKaye, a marginal matin\u00e9e hero.\n\nWhile lighter on expressionistic atmosphere then you'd hope, \"The Last Performance\" still has several stand-out moments. An early bit has Veidt walking a catwalk, shadows criss-crossing over his face. When the lover's affair is revealed, his shadow is cast huge on the wall, dwarfing the girl and her mate. Veidt's power as a hypnotist is displayed by overlaying his glaring face over the character performing the requested action. A memorable early scene has the man mesmerizing a skeptical audience member, their theater booth suddenly spinning around them.\n\n\"The Last Performance\" is another example of routine silent film material elevated by its lead actor. After years of obscurity, the film was recently released by the Criterion Collection\u0085 Kind of. It's a special feature packaged with \"Lonesome,\" a later film by the same director. This version has Danish titles with English subtitles and is apparently missing several sound sequences. The film is concise enough that I can't imagine those scenes would add much.",

Within a few years most of these people were in Hollywood, and Hitler had destroyed both the wonderful film industry they had helped build and the joyous Berlin that this film depicts.\n\nThe film tells the story of four strangers, two men and two women, enjoying a lazy Sunday by a lake in Berlin.  Nothing much seems to happen, but there is a lot going on, as the four interact.  There is innocence, the potential for love, the danger of sex, the force of jealousy and the pain of longing.  And through it all is the joy of living!\n\nMagnificently shot - largely in extreme close-up - the film allows us a glimpse of Berlin between the wars and it is sad to watch it with the knowledge of what was soon to be.  It would have been impossible to make this film with dialogue - the words would have destroyed the nuance and the emotion.  It reveals the power of silent cinema.\n\nIf the print you see is without a soundtrack, as mine was, then may I recommend playing the Essential Marlene Dietrich during the film.  I did this and the combination was unforgettable.",

                "text": "Some of the people commenting on this movies mention the fact that it was made only three years before Hitler came to power. While this is true, it is a historical misunderstanding to think that in 1929, when the film was conceived and shot, Hitler was inevitably looming at the political horizon in Germany. In fact, in the Weimar republic of the late 20s there was good reason to believe, that the worst was over for Germany after the chaotic post-WWI-period. The economy had somewhat stabilized, the political circumstances were still chaotic, but I guess people had grown accustomed to the fact that the government changed every so often. Germany was not a democracy in the truest sense of the word, but there was a thriving lower-middle class, and that is what the people in the film are meant to represent. There was good reason to believe, that these people would be typical of Germany at this time. To think that the film makers were delusional about the true state of the German state is a judgement that comes out of knowing what happened later.\n\nThats what makes this film even more special in my thinking. It shows that there could have been potentially another Germany, and that fascism was not the inevitable consequence of the social condition in the early 30s, German national character or what so ever. In fact, I think thats why this master piece is not as well-known as it deserves to be. It does not fit the bill of 1920s Mabuse-style Germany, where Caligari was an early warning of the Nosferatu was the blue-print of a coming dictator etc, all this Kracauer stuff.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to point out two additional things about this film, that make it unique. First of all, with its on-location shot, its amateur actors and its next-to-nothing ,yet social realist story, it is a rare fore-runner of the post-war cinema of Italy etc, that has not acknowledged. (Then again, Rosselini et al never saw this film, but then again, where is the \"neo\" in \"neo-realism\" coming from.) It also seems to me that this might very likely be the first \"indie\" movie. \"Indie\" is of course a very vague term, and what is called \"Independent cinema\" differs greatly depending on where the critic is coming from. But I personally know of no other movie, that actually made it into the movie houses, that was produced by a handful of non-pros without the support of a studio. Of course, there are the surrealist films etc, but this was a reasonably successful film, not some art experiment. This is a very daring thesis, I know, but so far nobody was able to prove me wrong....",

                "text": "If you enjoy classic silent cinema then you won't want to miss this treat. At times scenes are reminiscent of King Vidor's The Crowd, made just the year before (most especially in those moments set indoors, during which one of the couples gently bicker or the scene during which the principals first meet up for their group date); while at others the open air, carefree mood is suggestive of Renoir's masterpiece Partie de Campagne, made a decade later. But People on Sunday is a distinct work in its own right, an evocative film made by some stellar talent: the Siodmak brothers, Edgar Ulmer, Billy Wilder and Fred Zimmerman - all of whom would go on to varying degrees of success in the States after fleeing the Nazis. Their film is thus both a record of a time lost, a beautifully shot piece showing a Berlin that was soon to vanish for ever, as well as demonstrating the collaborative talents of some major figures in their early years. There is no hint of the dark years to come seen here, or the debilitating effects of run away inflation which marked the end of the Weimar Republic and led to the inexorable rise of extreme politics. People on Sunday is above such explicit social comment, unless it is political by the mere fact of focusing on ordinary people. It simply tells the tale of a group (played by non professional actors we are informed, but it hard to tell such is the quality of the performances) enjoying themselves while out on one sunny weekend day, picnicking, boating, kissing, promising more to each other and so on, interspersed with more general shots of the German people similarly at play. The skill and pleasure for the viewer today is in the way this is done, completely without ostentation, shot marvelously, everything still feeling fresh, spontaneous and genuine , and with a real feeling for place. Ironically, for this viewer at least, so much of the film seems so natural and fluid that one is more aware that is an illusion; such unforced art as this takes a great deal of time, patience and skill on the part of the participants and creators.\n\nIf you want to see more of German cinema from this period, other than more familiar classics, then this is a real treat, being both less known and marvelously restored. The BFI DVD version has been created from several sources and is the longest version available. It also features a splendid Weill-like score, which fits the milieu like a glove and which begs issuing separately as it stands up well as a listen on its own.",

                "text": "One of the surprising things about this film is the very acute, naturalistic and fundamentally humorous performances from an amateur cast, lacking all the usual strange, exaggerated mannerisms of silent cinema. The other impressive aspect of the film is the beauty of the photography, always playful and probing: the scene where an old man responds to the pompous nationalistic statues in the park is brilliant and affecting, if rather ambiguous. The modern score that was provided in the version I saw was effective and fitting: to be recommended. I agree that it all seems rather unreal, given that it takes place in 1929- yet it strikes me as not so much realistic, as naturalistic: perhaps striving to depict normality in difficult times. A very good and fundamentally humane film, lacking any real plot or suspense, but full of really interesting moments.",

                "text": "It all started in a Berliner caf\u00e9 where a bunch of young wannabe filmmakers were regularly meeting to chat about how movies were looking like and how they should look. It was 1929 and their feeling was that German expressionism had already given all that it could give. The young guys were thinking at something new, to move the cinematic art on. The idea came to make a new kind of a movie: an unpretentious story about youngsters like them, filmed on the streets of Berlin within everyday life; a story embedded in reality, a fiction embedded in a documentary. As money were missing, they decided to make the movie with amateurs: a taxi driver, a wine seller, a musical records seller, an unemployed model, an extra in (other) movies, all of them playing as themselves.\n\nIt was their first film: the young wannabee movie makers were Curt Siodmak, Robert Siodmak, Edgar Ulmer, and Fred Zinemmann. All of them would leave Germany after 1933 to become big names at Hollywood. Together with them was a veteran, Rochus Gliese (the only one who was uncredited). The cameraman, Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan, was also at his first movie. In a few years he would be the cinematographer for Le Quai des Brumes.\n\nIt was an indie movie long before the term would be defined. It has the freshness and the craziness indie movies have. Is it a story embedded in a documentary or a documentary embedded in a story? You can take it either way, because the two dimensions of this movie dissolve in each other and convey the same total empathy for simple people (the term would be now low middle class, or white collars; so it goes, we keep on inventing periphrases). The details in the images call in mind Vertov and other Soviet masters, only here in Menschen am Sonntag politics is totally left aside. It is a movie that loves reality and celebrates it as it is. In a couple of years this carefree joy will disappear for ever. What happened with the people from Menschen am Sonntag in the thirties, and then during the war? The same question should be for the people from Man with a Camera. We know the answer, for both.",

I'm not sure; those fantastic city sequences seem real enough and perhaps the regularly intoned opinion that Hitler was lurking in the shadows of a dispirited people, is itself a little fanciful. In any event this is a great little film filled with fantastic shots, moving street shots of and from moving trams, poetic close-ups of the young folk and a great sense of landscape at the lakeside. As usual with me and silent movies, I seem to get captions I don't need because the action is so obvious and whole sequences of back and forth dialogue left untitled. But just to watch the imagery is good enough and the little trysts, arguments, upsets and loving looks need no titles at all.",

Ulmer and Fred Zinnemann \u0096 all of them still in their twenties, all at the beginning of notable careers. The most interesting aspect in front of the camera is the shots of everyday life in Berlin immediately before Adolf Hitler's meteoric rise to power. Many of the people you see going about their ordinary, everyday lives \u0096 including possibly the young leads \u0096 will have participated in the war into which Hitler would plunge their country in nine short years \u0096 or been consigned to concentration camps from which they'd never emerge.\n\nThe plot is virtually non-existent: a couple of young men take a couple of young girls to the park for a little frolicking in the lake (and something a little more intense for one couple). The characters are curiously remote, making it difficult for the audience to get to know \u0096 or like \u0096 them. They are no heroes or villains as such \u0096 although there is an air of callousness about the men \u0096 so perhaps in a way, this apparent decision to keep at the audience at arm's length can be seen as one of the film's strengths \u0096 a reflection of people the way they are (the leads were all non-actors, plucked from obscurity for their brief moment of film stardom before returning back to lives of anonymity). This sense of emotional detachment persists even when the film reaches its most sensuous moments, possibly because Wilder et al fail to decide whether they are telling us a story about people as a group or people as individuals and thus devote inadequate time and attention to both.",

It is mostly interested in the details and shows the other side of the hectic, restless Berlin - the peace of a summerly Sunday. Here, the people are removed from the daily rush, and it is discernible how the makers agree with their protagonists. They celebrate the self-confidence of the young generation - which is not yet overshadowed by the big crisis at the beginning of the 1930s - and demonstrate the physical joy of life, the carefreeness and playfulness. The other side of this urban way of life is, which apparently only banks on superficialness and the momentary, promiscuity and the wounds coming from this, the harshness and the cold of changing feelings. It's cynically depicted in one long tracking shot over tree-tops (indicating symbolically sexual intercourse) that ends at a pile of thoughtlessly ditched trash.",

The previous comment on IMDb already explains the main charms of this film. It's a small and lovely film, but it's also easy to feel a little sad while watching it. It'd be nice to think that these Berliners went on year after year having simple sundays like the one portrayed in the film, but that wasn't to be. It's quite easy to feel for these people. As the actors were amateurs, and the plot so simple and unintrusive, it does end up feeling quite close to real life. It's not hard to picture them having a life that extends beyond the end of the film. I particularly liked the scene of an arguing couple, which ends up with them taking their fury out on postcards of each other's favourite movie stars (I noticed Greta Garbo and possibly Harold Llyod amongst them). I also enjoyed the scenes by the water, which are particularly sweet and simple, the scene involving people having their photos taken, and the girl who just wants to stay in bed. This mightn't be one of the great silent classics, but it's an enjoyable experience and very interesting historically. We're very lucky not to have lost it.",

                "text": "People on Sunday (Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer, 1929) is a sunny, carefree holiday film that's remarkable in a half-dozen ways. There's the sense of ambition, with incisive use of cross editing and jump cuts that's about 40 years ahead of its time. The use of non-professional actors well before \"neo-realism\" entered the filmic lexicon. Its portrait of pre-Nazi Germany: charming, accessible and somehow familiar, without the debauchery and excess commonly attributed to the Weimar Republic. Then there's the laid-back, quiet sexiness in the film's evocation of young lust that's unlike anything else in '20s cinema (I'm referring to the beachside frolicking, rather than the schoolboys slapping each other on the bum). The celebration of weekend freedom that's influenced everything from Bank Holiday to Spare Time to Human Traffic. And the truly staggering collection of talent associated with the movie, including five future Hollywood directors and an Oscar-winning cinematographer. Noir legend Robert Siodmak (The Killers, Criss Cross) helmed the film, assisted by B-movie legend Edgar G. Ulmer (The Black Cat, Detour). Billy Wilder (Sunset Blvd., Some Like It Hot) wrote the dialogue-free scenarios, based on an idea by Siodmak's brother Curt, who later penned The Wolf Man and directed some horror dross. People on Sunday was shot by Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan - who photographed Eyes Without a Face and The Hustler - with help from From Here to Eternity director Fred Zinnemann. Yes indeed. That clunking sound you may have heard was my jaw dropping on the floor when I first read about this movie.\n\nThe story is simplicity itself: a taxi driver (Erwin Splettst\u00f6\u00dfer) and a wine seller (Wolfgang von Waltershausen) take a pair of girls (Brigitte Borchert and Christl Ehlers) from Berlin to the country for a blissful, lazy Sunday, while Erwin's model girlfriend snoozes in bed. The quartet laugh, play, argue and flirt, as one coupling peters out and another holds strong. Both romances feature the same man, incidentally, illustrating the modern attitudes permeating this highly watchable, fast-paced film. The scale of invention is on a par with the dizzying Russian documentary Man With a Movie Camera, released the same year, but it's put to better use, serving an immensely engaging story with a rich rural atmosphere. Renoir must surely have seen this before preparing his own heightened, pastoral film, Partie de campagne. The non-professional actors, all essentially playing themselves, are extraordinarily naturalistic, enhancing the singular feel of this thoroughly lovely film.\n\nTrivia note: The BFI Region 2 release features a brilliant score by Elena Kats-Cherin. The DVD's accompanying booklet includes an interview with Borchert published shortly after the film's release. Though the movie was a huge hit in Germany, she confides to the reporter that her friends didn't enjoy it, as it was too similar to their own lives.",

                "text": "*After hearing the news of the death of Brigitte Borchert a few weeks ago at the age of 100, it seemed apt to include this film as part of my chronological reviewing project.* This simple tone-poem was considered quite avant garde on first release. Unfortunately, the most interest it will hold for many viewers will be the scenes of doomed, pre-Nazi Berlin. These give the film a poignancy it would not otherwise have had.\n\nThe film starts by introducing the people and showing a few moments of them in their real jobs. That is the only aspect that could be considered documentary. From then, the story is entirely fictitious. This transition symbolises the shift from the workday week to leisure time. As others have noted, the use of amateur actors and actresses means that, ironically, this piece has not dated quite so badly as other silent films which featured the professional stars of the era. The naturalism that is exhibited here is one of the film's great strengths. Borchert shines as the standout amongst these performers.\n\nWhen the film ends, we see the people once more as their real selves, returning to work. Not only has Sunday ended for them but so has their dip into the realm of film; as the audience leave the cinema, so are they leaving behind their brief forays into acting.\n\nUnfortunately, whilst the film seeks to capture the youthful energy and vigour of the young performers, the tone-poem story is slow and drags after a time. Despite the film being less than eighty minutes long, it quickly becomes quite ponderous due to the mundane events being captured. The trivial events being recorded simply do not warrant a film. They do capture the mood of the city on that laconic day but the contrived little dramas between the characters, whilst engaging at first, do not hold sustained interest. Some of the comedy is forced and whilst the scene of two of the people tearing up photos of actors and actresses is interesting on a symbolic level, (with the makers of this film deriding traditional Weimar film-making and questioning the need for professional thespians, let alone the system of vaunting them to the level of \"stars\"), the slapstick fights quickly become tiresome.\n\nAnother reviewer on this site mentions below that the film is most interesting for what it does not show: chiefly, the decadent subcultures for which Weimar Berlin is infamous. I do not think this is entirely the case. It is mentioned at the outset that one of the males is a part-time gigolo and none of the characters make any reference to attending a Church service despite the fact that it is a Sunday. Beyond that, though, it is simply a story of young people enjoying recreation time so perhaps the other reviewer is right in that the film-makers missed the bigger story of the Depression-era poverty, the clashes between Marxists and Nazis and the decaying moral fibre of the city. Alternatively, though history judges these as the most important events of the era, perhaps they did not affect the average Berlin youth as much as is supposed; perhaps these carefree young lives more accurately reflect those of the youth of the era before they were so savagely oppressed by the Nazis. It is, indeed, heartbreaking to think these young people will soon be forced to join the military and also experience censorship, an inundation of propaganda and, ultimately, fear and famine when their city is annihilated. As mentioned at the outset of the review, seeing these \"real\" people and knowing what will happen to them, their city and their society within a few years gives this film its only real poignancy today.\n\nWithout that historical context, though, while this remains an interesting film it is an inessential one.",

The Siodmak brothers, Robert and Curt would later become respected as a director and writer respectively. Robert Siodmak, in a period from 1944-1950, directed some of the best movies in the film noir genre. Curt ended up writing lower budgeted movies, specializing in horror mostly. Edgar G. Ulmer became famous as a cult film director here for several early low budget noir films in the 1940's. Billy Wilder, of course, had a long distinguished career as a writer, director, and producer of films that either satirized American values or had a realistic cynical outlook on life. Fred Zinnemann also had a 40 year plus career as a director of drama and westerns that often contained elements of strong emotional tension and suspense. These five men collaborated on this movie, which is really nothing more than a filmed record of ordinary people spending their free time on Sunday afternoons in Berlin. As the film unfolds in cinema-verite style, we realize these people have aspirations and thoughts similar to just about anyone else. In retrospect, there's the added significance of viewing this being made just prior to Hitler's rise to power. Were these people supportive of Hitler or did they flee the country as the makers of this film did? Were they simply caught in between and then had to make the best of it? This is an interesting curio for film buffs, but others won't find it to be much. **1/2 of 4 stars.",

                "text": "As everyone else here has explained, this film (People on Sunday)was done by a group of young Germans who later went on to stellar careers in film, not in Germany. I saw it screened at the Castro theatre in San Francisco where it was accompanied by a new musical score on the superb Wurlitzer house organ. A real treat. Also, this is possibly only the second or third time this film has been shown publicly in the U.S. The original film did not survive WWII intact, and the musical score was lost completely. What we have has been assembled from the remaining fragments found in Germany and various countries around Europe. An excellent reconstruction never the less.\n\nBut what fascinated me about this film is what you don't see. This is Germany in 1930. They've just come out of a devastating economic post-war period, and they're newly into the world-wide depression. Hitler is lurking in the wings, waiting for his big chance. Yet we see hordes of happy people in Berlin living simple pleasant lives. It's eerie. This is more of a tone poem than a filmic documentary, as they imply when they point out that that the cast is not professional actors. So in that sense it's strange.\n\nBut we get to see lots of daily street life in between-the-wars Germany, which is fascinating. We see the primitive technology. I did not see one airplane in the whole film. And as we watch, we wonder; did these young people march gleefully off to war, or did they flee to the west? Were they suckered in by Hitler, or did they just go along without thinking about anything? We see very little of the grinding poverty and desperation which Hitler was able to exploit, so I'm a bit skeptical about the supposed realism of the film. We don't see the ground that made a totalitarian dictatorship possible. The whole social environment we see on the screen is so benign and content, that I'm wondering what these young filmmakers were really thinking. Were they out of touch, indulging in wishful thinking, or just young and inept? These young film makers were rebelling against the Hollywoodish German film industry, which makes their artful but shallow film all the more perplexing.\n\nSo if you want one version of a stark historical period, with no great message, this film is worthy. But I think the real value here is what is not said and what is not shown.",

                "text": "\"Why Be Good?\" is a cultural treasure, not only because it's one of the few extant Colleen Moore features of the silent era, but because it has been crisply restored and boasts one of most voluptuous synchronized soundtracks of any late silent feature. As Leonard Maltin explained in his post-broadcast discussion on Turner Classic Movies which aired Sept. 28, 2015, the soundtrack musicians included such jazz greats as Joe Venuti and Tommy Dorsey. Vintage numbers including \"I'm Thirsty for Kisses and Hungry for Love,\" \"If You Want the Rainbow, You Must Have the Rain,\" \"Tall, Dark and Handsome,\" \"Flapperette,\" \"Changes,\" \"Le Chant des Boulevards\" and \"That's Her Now\" as well as era-evocative nuggets by William Axt, Hugo Riesenfeld and others, accompany the jaunty proceedings. If Moore was was ever better I'd like to see evidence. She had the face, the hair and the attitude that have come to epitomize \"flapper.\" In early talkies WBG's leading man, Neil Hamilton had a stodgy presence, but is more palatable in silence; if Moore was the ultimate flapper of her time, Hamilton was her equal in the young WASP romantic lead department. Louis Natheaux as a vainglorious would-be dance hall Casanova is the most entertaining supporting player in the early scenes, while Bodil Rosing and John Sainpolis serve the scenario effectively as Moore's parents.\n\nThe film showcases in a well-appointed and neatly packaged way the controversies about the role of women at the time. Objecting to her father's strictures about dress code and leisure activities, Moore argues that if she works to contribute to household upkeep, then she has a right to look like she wants (bobbed hair, lipstick, revealing dresses) and do what she wants (stay out half the night dancing, drink illegal alcohol, smoke cigarettes and ride around with men she's just met \u0096 in moderation, of course). These conflicts had been hashed out in countless films , including Moore's own \"Flaming Youth\" (1923) before this one was released. WBG then could well be characterized as the Last Word on flappers. \n\nThough not a part of the soundtrack, the popular song of the time \"She's a New Kind of Old Fashioned Girl\" perfectly suits the Moore character (\"Underneath the paint / You will find a saint\u0085\")",

In a poorer section of town, perky flapper Colleen Moore (as Pert Kelly) dances at fast-motion to \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" in a Charleston contest. A clear winner, Ms. Moore is also one of the thousand \"cuties\" employed as a clerk at Peabody's department store. Later, she hooks up with Mr. Hamilton at a hot roadhouse called \"The Boiler\". Moore angers her parents by arriving home late, but she really lives a virtuous life. However, Moore is late for work and ordered to see the new store manager...\n\nMoore's last silent is very nicely produced, for its star, by John McCormick. Director William A. Seiter and his crew present Moore in a flattering light, and give us a tasteful peak at her underwear in a couple of scenes. Trying to make time with Moore before she meets Hamilton, amorously greasy Louis Natheaux (as Jimmy Alexander) is a stand-out. Carey Wilson's story was a standard for the time. A pretty clerk getting attention from an (ideally, department store) millionaire was a common fantasy. The plot was well-worn, and doesn't fit the \"flapper\" girl. Mary Pickford and Clara Bow had released finer films on the topic. Moore's best rags-to-riches story is, appropriately, \"Ella Cinders\" (1926)...\n\nThis was Moore's final \"silent\" film. She transitioned to the \"talkies\" as well-spoken, but without distinction. Moore was likely hurt by being so closely associated with a bygone era. She was #1 in the industry's \"Quigley Poll\" of box-office stars for 1926. \"Why Be Good\" finds its star acting almost purely with the exaggerated silent mannerisms associated with silents. In the past, Moore demonstrated some of the subtly and style which would prove useful in all-talking pictures; but, here, she makes her preference known. The recently re-discovered print of \"Why Be Good?\" is spectacular, and it survives with its beautifully rendered \"Synchronized Musical Score and Sound Effects\" track. Let's see more...\n\n****** Why Be Good? (1929-02-28) William A. Seiter ~ Colleen Moore, Neil Hamilton, Louis Natheaux, Bodil Rosing",

                "text": "No movie better illustrates the inherent contradiction of the Hollywood flapper than Why Be Good? (1929). Colleen Moore is a party girl who wears make-up, bobbed hair, and short skirts. She flirts with young men and has built quite the reputation for herself; however, she (and the film) makes it clear that she is a \"good girl\" despite everything. Sexual liberation hand in hand with conservative values so that the audience isn't too radicalized.\n\nThis quality was my biggest issue with that second most famous of flapper pictures Our Dancing Daughters (1928) with Joan Crawford as the virginal flapper who is held up as an ideal modern girl in comparison with the Anita Page character, who sleeps around and is thus a horrible person who must be punished. Though that film claims to be modern, it upholds Victorian morality with relish. Yet in Why Be Good? the double standard is firmly attacked. While we are assured that Moore is a virgin with some conservative sexual values, the movie stands up against the double standard. When the male love interest is swayed by his sexist father into thinking Moore is trash because she flirts and parties, Moore shoots him down, claiming that if she stayed home and \"darned socks\" she would have hardly attracted his attention in the first place. In a society where a good girl is labeled a \"prude\" and a party girl a \"tramp,\" a woman just can't win.\n\nWell not here. In the end, the flapper wins the boy and the day. The message is quite progressive for the time, far ahead of Our Dancing Daughters. It's also more fun, with Moore showing off her charm and comic talent to great effect. She also sports some great playful sex appeal here. The Vitaphone score paired with the film is excellent, giving you a great sense of the time period, all jazz and Charlestons.\n\nI've rambled on enough, so let me make it brief: watch this movie. Colleen Moore is funny and the message quite modern, one society still has not fully taken to heart, even in the 21st century.",

It was there I learned that the film's star, Colleen Moore, died thinking all copies of the movie had been forever lost, including her reels which she'd given to a museum for preservation. But just like with Metropolis recently, someone at a cinematheque found a copy and after years of painstaking restoration work it was brought again to the world.\n\nI loved it. Colleen was so great portraying a flapper, and in a full house she and the other actors sure made us laugh a lot. I was very impressed with the Art Deco sets, the ingenious Boiler Room scene, and the moral of the story which I won't spoil. But yes there was a moral in the midst of all the dancing and comedy, and it was one that made all the women in the theater cheer!\n\nSo big kudos to the restoration folks, and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra for the superb live accompaniment.

Because early Vitaphone sound films consisted of both the film footage AND an accompanying record for sound, many movies seemed to be only available as sound discs or film footage. However, with the internet age, the Vitaphone Project has managed to track down BOTH copies of many films and film shorts--the record and film have finally been reunited! So, although \"Why Be Good?\" has been considered lost for years, here it is---for the first time in many, many decades.\n\nLike many of these early sound films, it really is NOT a talking picture but a silent with a soundtrack. A few songs in the film also are sung live by the actors. Otherwise, it's a traditional silent film. As for the soundtrack, it's actually at times too invasive and generally too loud! I actually wish, at times, there was no soundtrack!\n\nAs for the film, it's a romantic comedy about flappers--in particular, Pert Kelly (Colleen Moore). Pert LOVES to party and goes out all the time with her friends in order to dance. One night, she meets a nice guy, Winthrop Peabody Jr. (Neil Hamilton) and they fall in love. Later, she learns that he's her boss at the department store! The problem is that Winthrop Sr. is worried that Pert might be a bit of a slut. After all, she loves to party, loves to dance and is clearly a flapper. So what's next? See the film.\n\nThis is a pretty good film and is one of the last silent-style films from Warner Brothers. The story is good and talks about the double- standard for ladies--the need to be fun, adventurous, rather slutty and yet chaste! My only real complaint is the ending--which seems to come rather abruptly.",

                "text": "\nThe beloved character actor James Gleason had a second career as a playwright; he starred in several of his own plays on Broadway before becoming a film actor. One of Gleason's plays, the farce 'Is Zat So?' was a\nhuge box-office hit: if Gleason had carefully invested his royalties from this one play, he might never have had to work again. But he squandered the profits, eventually giving up on writing altogether and concentrating his talents on a long series of memorable roles as a film actor. 'Dumbbells in Ermine' was co-written by James Gleason, but so far as I can tell it's not based on any of his playscripts: he appears to have adapted a play written by other hands. He's also good in a supporting role here as Mike, the brassy trainer of Jerry Malone, the film's prizefighter hero.\n\nRobert Armstrong plays the fighter, giving a performance very similar to the one he gave as a broken-nosed boxer in 'Be Yourself'. He falls in love with the well-bred Faith Corey (Barbara Kent), but Faith's extremely religious parents are preparing her for missionary work in the Congo.\n\nSPOILERS COMING SOON. None of the characters in this movie are especially interesting, and there are too many subplots. In this movie, all the subplots are neatly tied up and solved by Faith's kindly old grandmother ... which is implausible enough by itself, but made much worse by the fact that the granny is played by Beryl Mercer. The late film historian William K. Everson once agreed with me that Beryl Mercer was the single most annoying performer in the entire history of Hollywood movies. (We also agreed that Sterling Holloway and Chester Clute were tied for second place.) This so-called actress, this baggage of whines is totally unbelievable as the font of all maternal wisdom, which is how she's cast in this movie. Mercer is painful enough in small supporting roles with only a few lines of dialogue: here, she plays one of the main roles, with a disproportionate amount of the movie's dialogue, and her whining voice is more excruciating than usual. Even Andy Devine's voice sounds more pleasant than Beryl Mercer's.\n\nI'll rate 'Dumbbells in Ermine' (with its almost totally irrelevant title) 2 points out of 10. James Gleason was probably right to phase out his scriptwriting career in favour of his superb performances as an actor.\n",

One rainy night she is saved from a lecher by a young man (John Harron) and invited upstairs for hot coffee. Harron is a musician and shares an apartment with three other musicians. They play for a local club.\n\nCompson asks them to play for her and they do a swingy version of \"Lovable and Sweet\" (which was written by Oscar Levant and Sidney Clare). She tells them it's a nice tune but they need a violin. They produce a violin and she plays a soft and beautiful version of \"My Dream Memory\" (the talented Compson was also a concert violinist). It's a terrific moment.\n\nShe takes charge of the guys and gets them a gig for big bucks at a swanky restaurant where they become local stars. A dethroned prince from her home country drops by and almost steals her away but she has fallen for Harron. The film ends with a rousing dance number, \"Broken Up Tune\" as played by the group.\n\nDespite the iffy accent, Compson is once again just wonderful. She has just the right touch of \"old world\" gentleness about her as she runs around managing the group) in a very aggressive American manner). Harron is also very good. He was the younger brother of DW Griffith star, Robert Harron, who died at age 27 from a mysterious gunshot accident in 1920. Kinetic Jack Oakie sings and dances (and fakes some clarinet playing). Acerbic Ned Sparks plays a few instruments as well and grouches at people. Guy Buccola is the fourth band member. Joseph Cawthorn (an expert at accents) is the club owner. Ivan Lebedeff is the prince. Among the big-band musicians is Russ Columbo, a major singing star of the 30s. Eddie Kane and June Clyde have small roles.\n\nWhat this film is not, is a frenzied backstage musical, which was the rage for a time after the success of THE Broadway MELODY. After an initial craze, the public quickly tired of backstage musicals and all-star revues. STREET GIRL went in another direction, tying together a love story with music.\n\nThis film is worth watching for the great music and unjustly forgotten Betty Compson.",

                "text": "STREET GIRL (RKO Radio, 1929), directed by Wesley Ruggles, is not a pre-production code movie about prostitution, but actually a breezy early talkie musical about a jazz quartet meeting Frederica Joyzelle, alias \"Freddie,\" a Hungarian violinist (Betty Compson) who has no place to stay. She is given room and board by the leader of the quartet (John Harron), and must share the apartment with three other fellows. Because of their acts of kindness, Freddie puts the quartet to work and success by becoming their manager.\n\nThis long forgotten musical of 1929, from the magazine story, \"The Viennese Charmer,\" that formerly played on American Movie Classics prior to 1993, and sporadically on Turner Classic Movies, surprisingly holds up through much of its 88 minutes, especially with Compson's violin solo of \"My Dream Melody\" (by Oscar Levant), reprized several times throughout the story. Other songs include: \"Loveable and Sweet,\" \"King of Othello\" and \"Broken Up Tune.\" Aside from John Harron playing Fall, there's Ned Sparks as Winter, Jack Oakie as Spring and Guy Buccola as Summer. With these names, it's easy to see why the band called themselves THE FOUR SEASONS. Ned Sparks is a great grumpy character who at one point forces himself to smile; while Jack Oakie, young and slightly thin, is still an attention grabber with his \"comedy relief,\" especially when Compson, after being offered room and board in an apartment occupied by four men, looking around where she's able to sleep for the night. Oakie, already lying in his bed, with a sneer smile on his face, moves over the sheets and pats on the vacant portion of his bed. Also in support are Joseph Cawthorn as Mr. Keppler, Ivan Lebedeff as Prince Nicholas, and Gus Arnheim and his Cocoanut Grove Ambassadors.\n\nSTREET GIRL must have been a success because it was was remade twice by RKO: THAT GIRL IN Paris (1936) with Lily Pons, Gene Raymond and Jack Oakie (again); and as FOUR JACKS AND A JILL (1941) with Ray Bolger, Anne Shirley and Desi Arnaz (in the role originated by Lebedeff). The 1929 original is highly regarded to those who simply enjoy watching hard to find movies such as this. (***)",

I never tired of the one bouncy show-stopper by Oscar Levant and Sidney Claire called \"Lovable and Sweet,\" despite it being played and sung several times. In fact, I was humming it for a day or so. What surprised me was seeing Jack Oakie looking so thin I almost didn't recognize him, and John Harron as the romantic lead, since I was used to seeing him only in bit parts in 30's movies.  I'm not sure if the music the boys played was dubbed or not, but the female lead, silent star Betty Compson, was an accomplished violinist and surely did her own playing.

Instead, Compson hooks up with attractive John Harron (as Mike Fall), who is so taken with briefly homeless Compson, he asks her to move in with his jazzy musical group.\n\nAs \"The Four Seasons\", Mr. Harron's \"Mike Fall\" is teamed with Jack Oakie (as Joe Spring), Ned Sparks (as Happy Winter), and Guy Buccola (as Pete Summer). Compson, conveniently a violinist, joins \"The Four Seasons\" both at home and on stage. The group is lively and likable; especially, the smiling Mr. Oakie, in his spring. The \"Seasons\" become successful, and romance blooms for Compson and Harron; but, a visiting Prince threatens the duo's happiness...\n\nCompson, who was at an artistic peak around the time silent films found their voice, tends to be a little too theatrical in \"Street Girl\", her starring vehicle; she certainly proves her versatility on the screen, however. Leading man Harron gives director/co-producer Wesley Ruggles the film's best acting performance; he (perhaps unfairly) certainly makes you wonder what heights deceased brother Bobby Harron might have reached in the \"talkies\".\n\nThe early Oscar Levant music (with lyrics by Sidney Clare) is very good. Gus Arnheim \"and His Coconut Grove Ambassadors\" skillfully dubbed their instrumentals; apparently, this is before future star Fred MacMurray joined the group. The frequently heard \"Loveable and Sweet\" is considered a jazz classic, in the cover version expertly recorded by Annette Hanshaw with the Dorsey Brothers. Although the early \"RKO Radio Picture\" production is more than a little rough around the edges, the musical/comedy genre storyline is solid.\n\n******* Street Girl (1929) Wesley Ruggles ~ Betty Compson, John Harron, Jack Oakie",

Their bond of friendship seems to have depth, and success doesn't really change them. The only bad things I can really say is - like another reviewer - Betty Compson really is saddled with a ridiculous accent in this one. Also, the movie is just too long.

Mike Fall is sort of the leader. After the show, he comes upon a masher bothering a young lady, Frederika (Betty Compson). Then he learns she's hungry and homeless and he takes her home to stay with his bandmates. This good deed is soon rewarded, as Frederika turns out to have musical talents of her own and she becomes part of the band. And, more importantly, she turns out to know the prince of the fictional country from which she came. His coming to their concert at a local restaurant suddenly makes them famous and, for once, very well paid. However, as Mike and Frederika fall in love, you see that Mike is a very stupid and insecure jerk-- and he's jealous of the attention the prince has paid to her. In fact, this jealousy threatens to ruin the band.\n\nThe film works best because the music is very enjoyable--even almost a century later. Additionally, Ms. Compson's odd accent works better than her accents in other films (such as a French one) because the country is fictional and you don't know what to compare it to!

Frederika believes that the group could demand much more money because of their playing skills and soon she's working as their manager and the five start to rise in popularity but when a Prince starts to woo Frederika, this doesn't sit well with Mike.\n\nSTREET GIRL was the first film ever produced by RKO, although it turned out to be the second that they'd actually release. For the most part this is a pretty good early talkie that manages to follow a pretty basic formula but thankfully the cast is so good that it makes up for the family story, which even by 1929 standards was pretty predictable. Of course, the majority of the credit has to go to Compson who easily steals the picture of the lovable blonde.\n\nCompson has the misfortune of having to speak with a silly accent that goes in and out throughout the picture but outside of this she's certainly a delight to watch. She manages to be incredibly lovable from the first moment we meet her and you just can't help but fall in love with her just like the four roommates do. Another good performance comes from Harron who manages to pull off that jealousy role quite well and we also get Jack Oakie in a supporting part. Ned Sparks is quite funny as \"Happy,\" the person constantly thinking someone is cheating him.\n\nThe story itself is quite predictable but the technical side of things are actually quite good for 1929. A lot of times these early talkies pretty much have the camera sitting still but that's not the case here as there's a little style on display here. There are some musical numbers throughout and all of them are quite good and it's worth noting that the violin playing is done by Compson herself.

I realize this is an early talkie and they were probably still struggling with ways to muffle the sound of the camera. But every shot seemed to have its own peculiar frequency, from whirring to humming to grinding to something like a garburator. I wonder now if early-talkie audiences noticed or cared about this, but it seems to me that many must have longed for the sophisticated accompaniment that had evolved by late in the silent era. What also amazes me is the leap in sophistication that took place in only a couple of years: by 1931, people had forgotten all about silent movies and screenwriters/actors had hit their stride.

The camera moves around quite a lot, the editing is fast-paced and the actors speak relatively naturally without the seemingly endless pauses between lines (sometimes between words!) that make a lot of early talkies virtually unwatchable today.\n\nThat's the good news. The bad news is the writer's dorky decision to change the origin of Betty Compson's character from a real country, Austria, to a fictitious one, \"Aregon\" (presumably not to be confused with the real Spanish province of Aragon); the awful accent Compson affects to sound suitably \"Aregonese\"; the casting of Jack Oakie without giving him any laughs (and he's utterly unable at any point to convince us he can actually play the clarinet); and a pretty sluggish pace despite all the camera movement and quick cutting. Also there's the obvious cheapness of using the same pre-recording of the song \"Lovable and Sweet\" all three times it's performed (you can tell because of the Beiderbecke-esquire \"smear\" John Harron's trumpet double performs in his solo each time). It ends up an O.K. movie but you get the impression it could have been better made a few years later \u0097 indeed it WAS made better on two separate occasions; \"The Girl from Paris\" isn't that great a movie either (though at least Lily Pons' accent is her real one!) but it's a damned sight better than this.",

                "text": "From the moment this movie begins we know we're in for something a tad unusual. In the early talkie days the folks at the Hal Roach Studio experimented with a new format for delivering opening credits: instead of simply filming title cards in traditional fashion, they built a spiffy Art Deco stage set, complete with proscenium arch, and hired a pair of young girls called the Crane Twins to march out onto the stage to deliver the film's credits verbally. The girls, who are dressed as bellboys, speak in unison at first, then alternate, then bow in tandem as they conclude. The effect is quite odd and (inadvertently?) funny, and kicks off Another Fine Mess on a curious note. The twins introduced several concurrently produced comedies featuring Charley Chase, Our Gang and the 'Boy Friends,' but this marks their only appearance in a Laurel & Hardy movie. I find the girls rather endearing myself, but in any case Roach's experiment with spoken credits didn't last long.\n\nEnter Laurel & Hardy chased by a cop, and we're back on familiar terrain. And yet things aren't quite so familiar after all, for it soon becomes apparent that this film has a different feel from the average L&H comedy. There's an actual plot, comparatively little slapstick, and an unusual amount of verbal humor. It's no surprise to learn that Another Fine Mess was based on a stage sketch, because once the boys seek refuge in the house where most of the action takes place, it does indeed feel like a stage act is underway, as they engage in an extended routine involving disguise and mistaken identity, with some farcical elements included for good measure. Ordinarily Laurel & Hardy didn't place much emphasis on dialog humor as such, but here they do, and happily the material is pretty funny. (Interestingly, the sketch that served as this film's source material was written by Stan Laurel's father, who was a theatrical manager and playwright, though it was said that the old gent did not approve of this adaptation.) In any other L&H short the guys would've spent five or ten minutes trying and failing to enter the house, but this time they've got a rendezvous with The Plot and not so much time for physical shtick.\n\nAs it happens, the guys have taken refuge in the home of Colonel Buckshot, who has supposedly departed for Africa. His servants, who were entrusted to rent the place out, have also left for a weekend vacation. Complications ensue with the arrival of a honeymooning couple, Lord and Lady Plumtree, who are interested in renting the place. Even bigger complications are set in motion by Ollie's decision to open the door to the couple in order to get rid of them, which forces Stan to impersonate the butler, which in turn forces Ollie to impersonate Colonel Buckshot, which in turn forces Stan to impersonate Agnes the maid. That's what I love about this movie, that decisive moment that starts the ball rolling. All the guys had to do was ignore the doorbell and wait for the couple to leave, but then they wouldn't be Laurel & Hardy, and we wouldn't have this fine mess to enjoy.\n\nIt's amusing to watch Ollie brazenly attempt to assume the role of the wealthy Colonel Buckshot, behaving the way Ollie believes such people behave, and he's well matched by Stan's quick-change impersonations of Hives the butler and Agnes the maid. I especially enjoy the scene between Agnes and Lady Plumtree. We have to assume that Thelma Todd's barely suppressed laughter throughout the scene is genuine; I mean, playing opposite Stan in drag, listening to him ramble on and giggle nervously, who wouldn't crack up? While it's true that the musical score and sound effects used in Another Fine Mess are somewhat more emphatic than the typical Roach comedy of the period, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, I feel this gives the film an agreeably wacky, \"cartoon-y\" feel suitable to the situation. I love the moment when the real Colonel (Jimmy Finlayson, underplaying as usual) returns home and tries to grasp what has happened. His furious response prompts the silliest wrap-up ever contrived for a L&H short. It's a laugh-out-loud ending -- it was for me, anyway -- and it ensures this movie's status as a treat for comedy connoisseurs.",

This particular scene of the film illustrates Stan's adaptability to talkie films, and to situation comedy, where there is less of the usual slapstick.\n\nI guess the use of more dialogue over slapstick in Another Fine Mess is due to the fact that it was thought that such comedy genre would be less funny, and therefore irrelevant to talkie films.

Pretty soon, Laurel and Hardy come running down the street. They're being chased by a cop. Why? Because he had found Stan and Ollie in the park sleeping on benches and when told to move on, Stan tipped his hat and said, \"yes, ma'am\". Stan and Ollie hid in a basement, accidentally locking themselves in.\n\n         \"Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into,\" says Ollie. But they find a way out and into Colonel Buckshot's mansion. They see Hives the butler and Agnes the maid leaving for a much needed vacation. But every time Stan and Ollie try to exit the house, the cop is right out there waiting. Suddenly, a couple, Lord and Lady Leopold Plumtree, show up and wish to rent the house. So Stan dresses up as Hives the butler and inadvertently invites them in. Ollie dresses up as Colonel Buckshot and attempts to show them the whole house. Stan also dresses up as Agnes the maid, according to Ollie they're twins. \"One was born in Detroit, the other in Miami\"; But then, the real Colonel Buckshot showed up because he forgot his bow and arrow. Stan and Ollie are discovered as phonies. They escape and are chased by cops.\n\n        It's a pretty good Laurel & Hardy short. The title became Ollie's catchphrase. Whenever the duo got into trouble, Ollie would always say, \"here's another fine mess you've gotten me into\", usually followed by Stan crying. So anyway, if you can find it, then I\nrecommend Another Fine Mess. Also, a happy 72nd birthday to the film!\n\n-",

The main story is also framed by a brief opening sequence and an interesting, nearly surreal finale. In the main part of the movie, they get a lot of mileage out of the basic situation, and Laurel plays his multiple role in an amusing fashion. James Finlayson gets a couple of good moments near the end, although he does not get as much to do as he did in some of their earlier features.\n\nIt packs a lot of material into a little under thirty minutes of running time, and there are a handful of moments when you can just tell that it was an early sound-era movie.

I'm not an expert on Laurel and Hardy, but as far as I'm aware, the disappointing and rather tiresome \"Be Big\" (1930) was their first -- and that would certainly have been much more enjoyable at two reels, as most of the extra action consists of Ollie literally getting caught in Stan's shoes -- a caper that soon wears out its welcome.\n\nThe next L&H three-reeler seems to be \"The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case\" (1930), which, despite its soppy conclusion (maybe it wasn't such a clich\u00e9 back in 1930?), is one of their funniest and most uproarious outings.\n\nAnd now we come to \"Another Fine Mess\". I love this film! I think the timing is superb -- and there's not a minute wasted! It's a fun picture all the way with not only L& H themselves in top form, but Thelma Todd at her prettiest and wittiest. Not only do all three have great roles, but all three make the absolute most of their opportunities. Oliver really shines as the bogus millionaire hunter, Stan is wonderfully adept at his quick-change impersonations, and Thelma, of course, as just said, is perfectly wonderful.\n\nThe movie gains its humorous intensity not only from its superb scripting, playing and direction, but simply from the fact that, aside from a quick introduction with the boys being chased by a cop and the obligatory chase climax, it all takes place in the one setting, and so what have here is the concentrated humor of a stage play as well as the wider range of the movies.",

The boys play a pair of bums who stumble into the unoccupied house of a local millionaire when avoiding arrest by the police and then pose as owner and butler/maid when prospective tenants of the property come calling. The comedy here is a little too one-note once Lord Plumtree and his foxy new wife arrive, spending too much time focusing on Stan's switching between the characters of Hives the butler and Agnes the maid (Agnes, incidentally, would resurface in A Chump in Oxford). There is a laugh-out-loud moment when the boys become tangled up with a quartet of rattling window blinds as they try to evade capture by the police though, and a truly surreal finale which sees them inexplicably disguised as a pantomime cow (?) riding a bicycle to freedom. The film is also noticeable for coining the phrase 'Another fine mess,' which would incorrectly be attributed to Hardy by impressionists forever more.

This film definitely falls into the okay category with overly familiar situations and humor that just doesn't make you laugh.

The movie is lacking in some true laughs and comical/slapstick moments, even though of course the movie still perfectly entertains.\n\nThe story is simple and a remake of the far superior comedy short \"Duck Soup\". Of course Laurel & Hardy movies always have a simple story, as they should in my opinion but in this case some more creativity wouldn't had been a bad idea.\n\nNot even James Finlayson in a small role can make the story feel lively and creative. Basically the most amusing character of the movie is being played by Charles K. Gerrard. Never a good sign when the most amusing character in a Laurel & Hardy movie is being played by a supporting actor. Sure, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are amusing in their roles and they provide the movie with some good moments but it all was a bit too simple for my taste and really lacked in true comical creativity.\n\nCertainly not a bad movie and still worth seeing and entertaining enough but nevertheless the movie isn't as good or funny as the rating here at the moment (7.4) would suggest.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

It doesn't come off. It's merely another third-rate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures (Ollie's finger wiggling, Stan's blank stares, etc.) or comic abilities.\n\nThe film begins with them running from the police. Since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot's mansion. The premise for the 'humor', Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. They are not playing 'Stan and Ollie' in this film. Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.\n\nStan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here. He's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree's name, the \"Call me a cab! Okay you're a cab!\" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a non-sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson is still doing his silent-era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks.\n\nStan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'Sons of the Desert'(1933) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.\n\nSince this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it? I have to give it a 3.",

This isn't as humorous as it might sound due to the leads not affecting greatly different characteristics (as Stan would in A Chump at Oxford) than their previously established personas. Even Stan's recreation as \"Agnes\" doesn't allow him to take on a different accent.\n\nJames Finlayson is wasted in a minor role and weirdly; the title again perpetuates the myth of Ollie's catchphrase, though here again he says \"another nice mess\" not the \"fine\" of the film's name. However, seeing the picture open with two twin girls dressed as bellboys, cringingly reading out the credits in stereo should give warning to what is one of the more glib, less inspired L & H vehicles.

                "text": "From the first seconds of this film's opening credits you know something's a little \"off.\" Leo the Lion roars his roar in silence, backed not by the beloved Koo-Koo theme but by unfamiliar, generic theme music which cuts off sharply when the dialog begins, and from then on it's talk, talk, talk. While Laurel & Hardy buffs will tune in to Unaccustomed As We Are well aware that it was the team's first talking film, willing to cut the boys some slack, casual viewers looking for a chuckle or two should be warned that this is a movie with all the faults of the earliest talkies, i.e. slow pacing and somewhat uneasy performances. All things considered, the guys adapted pretty well to the new technology, but at times this film looks like a nervous dress rehearsal.\n\nThe marital squabbling between Ollie and Mae Busch, later developed into a fine art, feels a little forced here, and occasionally suggests an improv exercise in an acting class. And while it's always a pleasure to see Thelma Todd and Edgar Kennedy in support, it's apparent that they're just as uncomfortable the new technology as our two stars. Generally speaking Stan comes off better than Ollie because so much of his material is visual, allowing for his hilariously over-scaled reactions. It could be mentioned too that Stan had more extensive stage experience than most of his colleagues, and was therefore more comfortable delivering dialog.\n\nStill and all, Unaccustomed As We Are is a decent maiden effort in the new medium, and there are some interesting attempts to experiment with sound, as when Ollie puts on a jazz record during one of Mae's tirades and causes her to unintentionally rant in time to the music. It's kind of odd, but amusing. Other bits involving off-stage explosions, fights, and crash-bang sound effects must have made more of an impression when the film premiered, when their impact was still so new. But the major problem here is uncertainty about what sort of material will work in talkies and what won't. For instance, there are moments when the guys strike deliberately theatrical poses and deliver their lines in the style of ham actors, as when Ollie threatens to leave for South America \"to do Big Things!\" Cute, but this sort of shtick played a lot better in the silent days, and they would soon leave it behind. Dedicated Laurel & Hardy buffs will surely want to see their first talkie, but even the fans need to make allowances for (understandable) awkwardness and remember that soon after this debut, after a little more practice, the guys were producing talkies as strong as their late silent output.\n\nA couple of technical notes: a silent version of Unaccustomed As We Are was also released in 1929 for theaters not yet wired for sound, and for many years it was the only version available, but it's deadly to watch and should be avoided. The major element of interest here, after all, is to observe how the gang at the Roach Studio handled the new technology, and without that you've got nothing. The soundtrack was not re-discovered until the 1970s, and, in the version of this film currently available on DVD, Reel Two is in pretty rough shape. During the latter scenes you can detect a strange, metallic echo under the dialog, which at times sounds almost like the chirping of birds. That's the closest you'll get to hearing the Koo-Koo Song in this one!\n\nP.S. I'm pleased to add that there's a newly restored version of this film now available, and the sound quality in the second reel is much improved.",

As such the sound quality is pretty poor and at some points the dialogue doesn't flow very well because it sounds like it is being said very deliberately so as to be clearly heard.  This slows the action down which is a bad thing because the comedy isn't as to the fore as usual.\n\nThere are still some funny scenes but it didn't totally work for me.

The support cast are amusing and do better with the dialogue than Hardy (not sure why) but it is more Laurel's film than before.\n\nOverall this is a good short in that it has several good scenes that are funny, but, because they are just starting out with sound on film here, they are not as good as they quickly become.",

So many times, the familiar is handled in a slightly better way. Take, for instance, the harpy wife. After berating Stan and Ollie, she unexpectedly returns and apologizes for her actions! And, when the neighbor's wife is stuck inside Ollie's apartment in her underwear, you THINK the husband is just going to kill the boys, but the tables are actually turned on the husband.

Mr. Kennedy takes Ollie and Stan outside with the trunk - which Mrs. Kennedy is hiding in - talking like he's on their side, and when they get back, Mrs. Hardy has a spaghetti dinner ready. Mr. Kennedy comes back wanting to beat the boys up, after being beaten by his wife, only Ollie gets hit, Stan gets nothing when Mrs. Kennedy bashes her husband over the head with a vase, but he does tumble down the stairs in the end.

And they, along with supporting players Edgar Kennedy, Mae Busch, and Thelma Todd, talk quite a bit, more than I'm used to in their subsequent films. Both Kennedy and Busch seem not quite what I'm used to hearing concerning their voices but that's excusable since this is their first time with sound. And quite a bit of the gags depend on what they sound like, as opposed to simply seeing the action playing out especially with the final gag. Oh, and I loved the way Ms. Busch's rants seemed in tune with a record in one of the scenes! This is also the first time Hardy says, \"Why don't you do something to help me?\" as well as that of Stan's constant crying. In summary, Unaccustomed as We Are isn't perfect, but it's still a very funny Laurel & Hardy film.",

A neighbor, wife to a tough cop, comes to their rescue and loses her dress in the process. The boys have to hide her in a trunk when Mrs. Hardy and the cop both return home. Chaos ensues.\n\nThis short, Laurel and Hardy's first sound one, is certainly pleasant enough. The small supporting cast is filled with regulars with Edgar Kennedy as the cop, the ill-fated Thelma Todd as Mrs. Kennedy and Mae Busch as Mrs. Hardy. The main problem is that the film is that action and staging is so subdued and contained, particularly in comparison to their late silent shorts. It would be easy to argue that Laurel and Hardy reached their prime in the waning days of the silents with films like \"Two Tars,\" \"Big Business,\" \"Liberty\" and \"Double Whoopee.\" Those films are all comic gems. This is definitely a step backwards. This film also suffers in comparison to their late Hal Roach feature \"Blockheads\" which reprises almost the entire short with more assurance and better production values.\n\nStill, no film with the boys is a total loss.

This means that much of the dialogue and sound affects seemed exaggerated and less natural. The only actor in this to carry off their role to perfection is Thelma Todd, who seems totally at ease in this short.\n\nThe theme of the film is about the changing relationships between men and women. At a time when all women aged 21 and over had just been granted the vote in Britain, saw women gaining confidence and refusing to play the door matt within marriage as depicted in this short when Mae Busch's character refuses to cook a meal for the duo on a whimsical request from Ollie, who in playing her husband is taking Busch's character for granted. Leaving the duo to their own devices the two destroy the house and subsequently bring about trouble in their endeavours to cook dinner, therefore demonstrating the importance of the 'traditional' role of women, which is still to this day undervalued. It also demonstrates that if men can't even cook a simple meal, then is it any wonder the state of the world?",

                "text": "Duvivier's AU BONHEUR DES DAMES is a gorgeous surprise, since along with SUNRISE, METROPOLIS, and a few other of the masterpieces of the period, it taps into so many key movements and concerns of the 1920s. It's a faithful adaptation of Zola's novel by the same name, part of his sweeping \"Rougon-Macquart\" series that casts a panoramic look on 19th century French society. The story, banally put, is a proto- \"You've Got Mail.\" But instead of the giant bookseller edging out the human-scale bookstore in the neighborhood, it's a small fabric merchant vs. the huge department store. (The department store was a new phenomenon in the mid-to-late 19th century.) Like SUNRISE, this movie shows the seduction of the fast pace of the modern city, mass consumption and revolution of our desires--and the insults that modernity hurls at older ways of thinking about community and \"values\" such as honesty, family, and propriety.\n\nAU BONHEUR is now available on DVD, with a very good musical score. It is an exquisite example of what silent-era cinematic \"Impressionism\" was all about--including fantastic experiments with conveying sound, emotion, speed, and confusion through images and their editing. In sum, this is an important film and a beautiful one. Wacky ending, but let's not spoil it... With not only Dita Parlo (cf. Vigo's L'ATALANTE and Renoir's GRAND ILLUSION), but Nadia Sbirskaya (Renoir's CRIME OF M. LANGE).",

Every cine buff has got to see both and make up his mind.\n\nNB.In Zola's saga ,\"Au Bonheur des Dames\" is the follow -up to \"Pot-Bouille\" (Octave Mouret is featured in both books).In 1957,Duvivier transferred to the screen that book,with only fair results .The movie was slagged off by Truffaut who (for once) was not wrong.Gerard Philippe was cast as Mouret.",

Duvivier doesn't just show you the mad rush of crowds of people but through his use of camera movement makes you feel that you too have been swept up in the rush. I have to admit that a large part of the film's impact comes through the new score by Gabriel Thibaudeau which helps express the inner feelings of the characters. The combination of the score and editing in the shopkeeper's crackup sequence is so intense that I felt I was going mad myself. Clearly, Duvivier was familiar with Eisenstein's work and theories. The ending was a disappointment. The entire film makes you feel for the little guy but in the end the film makes an about face and seems to say that progress is good no matter what the cost. Perhaps this ending was demanded by the film's financial backers. Nevertheless, the shortcomings of the story only slightly weaken the impact of this powerful work of art.",

                "text": "This needs to be considered among the preeminent achievements of silent film, and pending more exposure I'm sure it will, up and above anything Murnau did, and in the lofty company of visual epics La Roue and L'Argent.\n\nMy theory is that the French revolutionized the cinematic eye, the subjective eye in motion, at around the same time but quite independently from the Soviets, by studying the same DW Griffith scenes. Since then exists a deep fraternity between the two schools, up to Godard and beyond, and of course well before; it was Parisians who realized the first modern commune after all.\n\nInsofar as that revolutionary eye is concerned, you'll be hard pressed to find a better resume; just the stunning array of technique used is the equal of Kane, 10 years early.\n\nBut there is a lot more than virtuoso display here, channeled from the French notion of noir at the time when it was still a fluid and new impulse for a certain type of story, and not yet melded with the detective film and solidified as a category of its own. The Germans going back to Caligari and Mabuse and reflecting the overall daze of the Weimar period, had posited an early noir blueprint in metaphysical terms; forces of some calculating darkness devising narratives to control dazed minds. The French were more clear-eyed and pragmatic, no doubt influenced by Marx and going all the way back to that commune.\n\nThis compares favorably to L'Argent from two years before. Both are adapted from Zola, both are highly asymphonic looks of modern life in motion, both demystify Weimar film's evil masterminds to be nothing but scheming business men in service to their capital. Both nevertheless assert profound forces mobilizing for control of a multi-layered world.\n\nThe central character is a plucky young girl fresh to Paris from we presume a slice of innocent countryside, for her wide-eyed introduction to big city life she is layered through wheels, chains, trains, streets bustling with automobiles, visually rendered transparent as another cog in the huge machinery. Life does not simply happen here but is actually engineered, has staccato sound, urgency. Her haberdasher uncle at the brink of foreclosure owns a shop opposite the new dazzling mega-plex, a real palace of commerce called Au Bonheur des Dames. Ordinarily, this would unfold a trite David/Goliath plot, progress starving out the little guy plus a forlorn denouement. Not so here.\n\nThe genius of the thing is all in the rhythm of shifts between opposing pairs of characters saturating the world to reveal some part of the machinery. There is no solid anchor, and the film can be read simultaneously from multiple overlapping points.\n\nOn one hand we have the engineers, the nerve center from where they hatch their plans for control is above the throng of consumers excitedly cavorting in the huge halls of the department store, and later on a balcony overlooking nothing short of the entire city. When the owner proclaims on a whim during a company trip that the first in a bathing suit wins a pay rise, the entire crowd of employees is seized in a paroxysm.\n\nThe women on the other hand, our orphaned heroine and as counterpart the haughty daughter of a multimillionaire funding the enterprise, already living the dream the other aspires to, lavished by a father the other has been deprived of. The manager of the store is between them, love is at stake.\n\nA third pair, the haberdasher uncle stubbornly clinging to his small property and his young clerk who eventually gives in to the seductive dream on the other side of the street. The manager is once again layered in between, arriving at the scene too late to note dire repercussions of his business. The clerk's wife is in her last throes, and we presume this is going to translate as a karma where he loses love, final and irrevocable punishment for hubris.\n\nAt this point, the film pulls an amazing coup. Faced with eviction notes, the uncle has gone stark raving mad, the scene is rendered with tremendous rapid-fire montage as nearby construction workers on the Bonheur payroll demolishing the walls of his mind. This would have been the Soviet notion only a few years back, workers crushed by the capital and spliced together in a way that arms the eye. Now I don't know if this is found in Zola or is Duvivier's contribution..\n\n..but in the finale the manager is contrite and about to call off his involvement with Bonheur, except is stayed at the last moment by the young girl proclaiming her love and devotion to him and the incandescent dream. This is the anti-Strike, the anti-Potemkin.\n\n(I believe this small scene, just these two minutes, explains away the entire difference in French and Soviet worldviews. The French would have clearly seen around them the same motifs as workers did in Petrograd, no doubt, but this system had already succeeded to provide a good enough life. 1936 would see the first paid vacations.)\n\nAnd this is the genius for me, because it's a really trite finale at face value, this sudden change of heart, almost immoral, but we can read it through many different pairs of eyes, starting with the manager. \n\nAnother layer on top of all this; the neon-lit mega-plex as a sumptuous movie house, named the same as the movie no less, the young girl enticed to star in a dream that has reserved a place for her, the whole movie daydreamed somewhere as a movie, probably back in the countryside or during a boring day on the job.",

By coincidence the Zola novel on which this is based is part of the sequence containing La Bete Humaine so who's to say that it wasn't Renoir - working several years later - who sought to link the two via locomotives. I tend to agree with other notices here regarding the acting though we have to remember that back then acting was, of necessity, what today we would describe as 'hammy' or over the top. This does not apply to the lead, Dita Parlo, so unforgettable in La Grande Illusion, who was a fine actress with relatively few credits. The story - big business versus the Little Man - is, of course time-honoured and Duvivier tells it splendidly in fluid camera-work laced liberally with opticals. A must-see.",

The film combines this breathtaking visual tableau with a story of heartless progress and its consequences.

I am a substance over style audience member, so, though glad I saw it in a theater,I didn't really like this film.I enjoyed the way the film looked, the cinematography and editing were superb as was the art design, but I had real problems with the story and the acting. The endless cheesecake shots didn't help either. I thought if Dita Parlo either opened her eyes really wide or look down in a softly feminine modest manner one more time I was going to scream. It was hard to take such an irritatingly gamine performance after seeing Lillian Gish the day before in The Scarlet Letter! I felt the two films were equal in terms of the physical aspect of film-making- cinematography etc. However, Seastrom's cinematography and settings served to highlight the inner and social conflicts of the characters. I found Duvivier's style a bit overbearing and obtrusive- at times it overwhelmed the story and, for me, didn't compensate for the lack of interesting characterization or a compelling narrative. For me, the uncle's snapping and going nuts was the highlight of the film, because I felt for him. I was, of course, rooting for and pleased by the shooting of the personnel",

                "text": "Under the opening credits of this Vitaphone short we hear the strains of \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles,\" while on the title card we see an illustration of a bull. As soon as the sketch's central character Aubrey Piper is introduced, we realize that these audio-visual choices are deliberate and ironic. Aubrey (played by Franklin Pangborn) is a braggart, always exaggerating his status and his accomplishments. His mother-in-law, who has a low opinion of him, refers to his constant boasting as \"blowing bubbles.\" You'll notice this also explains the presence of the bull.\n\nAubrey Piper was the creation of George Kelly, a playwright who wrote a number of satirical comedies sharply critical of the middle-class way of life. Kelly's biggest Broadway success, his 1924 comedy The Show Off, was built around Piper and his bragging. The play was a big hit in its day and proved to have impressive staying power, for in later years it was frequently revived on stage and also filmed several times: in 1926 with Ford Sterling, in 1934 with Spencer Tracy, and in 1946 with Red Skelton. (And it was broadcast on TV in 1955, in an adaptation starring Jackie Gleason.) Clearly there's something about the central character that has appealed to audiences over the years. Perhaps people see him as a familiar American type, reminiscent of a relative or someone they knew at school. The role has also attracted top stars of the stage, screen and TV. For actors it seems that the trick to portraying Aubrey Piper is one of balance: if he's too full of himself he'll come off as obnoxious, but a good performer can balance the character's obvious flaws with more appealing qualities and manage to make him likable, or at least bearable.\n\nAubrey Piper's full-length vehicle The Show Off grew out of a one-act play called \"Poor Aubrey,\" which Kelly wrote as a vaudeville sketch. This Vitaphone short captures that sketch and is, in a sense, a precursor to the many versions of The Show Off that followed. It's moderately entertaining, but for me the biggest drawback is the casting of the crucial role of Aubrey. Normally I enjoy Franklin Pangborn, in fact he's one of my favorite comic character actors. He made a career of playing fussy, dithering gents, often hotel managers, floorwalkers, or sellers of high-end goods. He could perform a magnificent double-take, and hold his own opposite the best comedians in the business, but he's not the right person to play Aubrey Piper. From the first moment of this short, when he and his wife Amy (Helen Ferguson) begin bickering, Pangborn strikes a tone that feels more harsh than funny, and he never varies from it. The Pipers are expecting company, a well-off friend of Amy's, and they're both tense about the visit. But Aubrey is insufferable. He's vain about his toupee, he fusses with houseplants and books, and he insists on uncovering the Victrola so that their guest can see it. When Amy's friend Marian arrives and Amy steps away briefly, Aubrey seizes the moment and boasts to her about his business success, his possessions, etc. He also claims that he has graciously permitted his mother-in-law to reside in his house, although in fact she is the homeowner who permits HIM to live there! Eventually, thanks to his mother-in-law and his own foolishness, Aubrey gets his comeuppance.\n\nSurely this material was funnier on stage. Here, with the miscast Pangborn in the role, the appeal of Aubrey Piper is a mystery. There's no nuance in his performance, no charm. It's impossible to imagine why Amy stays with him or why, in a larger sense, audiences have been so drawn to productions of The Show Off over the years. In a film that runs about fourteen minutes the character wears out his welcome very quickly. In any case this short does hold some interest for theater historians, and the ladies are good; Ferguson makes a nice impression as the long-suffering Amy, while mother-in-law Clara Blandick went on to Hollywood immortality as Auntie Em in The Wizard of Oz. As for Mr. Pangborn, well, I'll continue to enjoy his splendid moments in such comedies as Easy Living and The Bank Dick, great movies in which he was perfectly cast.",

Not only would the bears eat the penguins, but they come from completely opposite parts of the world! Yes, I know that Coke also puts these two critters together but in the wild this would never happen. Trust me on this folks.\n\nNow that I have gotten this off my chest, let's get to the film \"Arctic Antics\". It's a very good black & white cartoon from Disney marketed under the 'Silly Symphonies' label. These were generally very sweet little cartoons with lots of critters dancing about to the music---and not the familiar sort of characters like Mickey and Donald. In the case of this film, lots of cute animals dance about in the frozen North--all accompanied by the usual sort of musical score. While the animation is not among the company's best, it is quite enjoyable and gets points for being quite cute without being cloying. Well worth seeing.",

There's a polar bear cub which yips like a dog as it jumps from floe to older polar bear and then into the water.\n\nThen you see seals and a walrus or two and more dancing, frolicking and music. The best bit here is a seal trying the patience of a walrus enormously by using him as an instrument. We're treated to \"singing\" as well.\n\nWe close with penguins, moving mostly in unison, save for one who's rather out of sync.

It is nice, but not really anything to rave about. It does lack cohesion, if you're willing to forget that polar bears and penguins live on the other side of the world and that polar bears eat penguins you'll be fine, if not then that's my point. The cartoon doesn't really have any story to speak of and doesn't really get going pace-wise until the penguins are introduced and apart from the major set piece it's basically just nice to watch but not much else or new. However the animation is of the fluid and smooth kind, with the way a seal is drawn while underwater, the music is of great energy and sounds absolutely beautiful and the dancing while not as inspired as other Silly Symphonies is well choreographed with some very interesting use of motion such as animals floating in the foreground and others staying put in the background. The characters are very cute too, I especially liked the Mickey Mouse-like polar bear. All in all, not a special cartoon or a masterpiece, but nice all the same. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The penguins, seals, polar bear, and even a large walrus are marching about, jumping & dancing & slapping their bottoms an amazing number of times...\n\nThis black & white cartoon has an invisible plot and is basically an exercise in action/reaction animation. The Disney animators seem to know a curiously large number of posterior gags. Notice that the face of the polar bear cub enjoys a remarkable resemblance to that of Mickey Mouse.\n\nThe SILLY SYMPHONIES, which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929, are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation. Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount, with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music. There was little plot in the early Symphonies, which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals, all moving frantically to the soundtrack. Gradually, however, the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot, characterization & photographic special effects. The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale, Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed. It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring. In 1939, with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon, Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES; they had run their course & served their purpose.",

Equipping cinemas for sound involved a small fortune that some of the lesser movie houses didn't have and as well as that even some of the big studios had a \"wait and see\" approach to see if talkies were just another fad. But also in some country cinemas resentful audiences had rebelled against the glut of films that were all talk and no action and projectionists told how they would have to turn the sound down unless they wanted a riot!!\n\nAnd this film would certainly have fitted the bill as there was absolutely no action!! Lucien Prival was not the type of actor used to top billing: he had a very distinctive look and apparently his resemblance to Erich von Stroheim often saw him cast as German officers. I remember him vividly as Chick, one of Louis Wolheim's henchmen in \"The Racket\"(1928). \n\nApart from the exotic beginning there was not a lot of excitement in this Argosy-Chesterfield-Gem bottom of the biller!! The accursed Okuri peacock fan has been an ill omened bringer of bad luck down through the years and Mr. Rossmore will have reason to regret his purchase when he is found dead the following morning. A policeman speedily comes (the bumbling Tom O'Brien) but he is not here for the murder - Rossmore called him the night before to arrest someone for robbery!!\n\nWith a flourish the sinister Dr. Dorfman (Prival) appears with orders from the police head quarters to take charge of the investigation. From evidence given it seems Rossmore's house was like Grand Central Station after his wife departed (with the fan) to the Opera: his lawyer, the lawyer's secretary (Gladden James) even a Miss Joan Kendall (Dorothy Dwan) in a scene to show Rossmore was not quite the gentleman he made out. There are more - Mrs. Rossmore back from the Opera, young Kendall - Joan's brother and Rossmore's assistant, even the maid comes in for cross examination. At just over 50 minutes it is mercifully short.\n\nDorothy Dwan, who as Joan had little to do but put up a bit of a struggle, then spend the rest of the movie looking worried, was more at home in comedies supporting her husband Larry Semon but with Semon's sudden death in 1928 she made only a few more films before retiring in 1930.",

After vainly trying for a New York berth without success, the picture went into general release on August 1, 1929. One wonders what unhappy cinemas in what unhappy small towns booked the movie as a pre-Interval item that patrons would appreciate coming late for. Actually the plot doesn't start off too uninterestingly \u0096 the plot, I said, not the movie itself \u0096 it just gets more and more tepid as it sluggishly proceeds to a no-action climax \u0096 in fact, a conclusion so dull that I'm sure it played to an empty house. It's Tom O'Brien as an always-wrong detective who brightens the action for a while before we finally tumble to the sad fact that he has only the one funny line and that he's not going to get any funnier, but simply repeat himself ad infinitum at every twist of the plot. Lucien Prival as the super-courteous detective similarly wears out his welcome long before he identifies the killer. I almost wrote \"before he pounces on.\" But that would be incorrect. \"Pounces\" implies action and believe you me, there is no action whatever in \"The Peacock Fan\" from start to finish. And by that stage, we couldn't care less who killed Mr. Moneybags, let alone what his or her boring motives may have been. Available on an excellent Alpha DVD.",

Ms. Garland herself has a brief solo but I really couldn't understand what she sang. Still, she also sounded pretty good. I should mention that she, and many other kids, are in costume. Also, those other kids do some dancing that weren't very exciting, to tell the truth. All of them seem to be watched by a middle-aged man who, yeah, does seem creepy! In summary, Bubbles is a fascinating curio for any Questal and Garland completists out there but I don't really recommend this.",

While there are lots of wonderful old shorts such as Laurel and Hardy, classic cartoons, etc., the very early years of sound pictures also brought some very strange and stupid stuff as well. This 8 minutes short from Vitaphone is a great example of strange and stupid, that's for sure! There's really no plot to the film. It starts with Mae Questel blowing bubbles under a tree. I immediately recognized her as the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, though she looked much more like Mary Pickford. What I did not recognize shortly after this opening scene was a very very young Judy Garland as one of the Gumm Sisters who did some really pathetic song and dance numbers. It honestly looked like one of those grade school pageants parents are forced to endure, except in this case the sound quality was pretty poor! Only see this if you are curious about seeing Ms. Questel or Ms. Garland for purely historical reasons. Otherwise, it's like witnessing a train wreck--a ghastly and blood-curdling train wreck!\n\nPS--I STRONGLY agree with the other two posters that found the old guy with the cigar to be really creepy! He was sort of like the officiator over this awful pageant and I don't think most parents would feel very comfortable about leaving their tykes with him!\n\nAlso, the film says 'Technicolor' at the beginning, but the surviving print today is in black & white.",

The Big Trail was simultaneously shot in both 35mm and 70mm (Grandeur) versions, and both versions are shown on Fox Movie Channel from time to time, so it's easy to compare one with the other. The Grandeur version (broadcast in letterbox @ approximately its original 2-1 ratio) is more impressive cinematically with its wide angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem that beset early CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups forced upon director Raoul Walsh because of focus problems. Scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer. Watching the two versions simultaneously, one gets an accurate idea of which shots Walsh chose to shoot close-up, in the standard version, but could not, in the Grandeur version. There are also a couple sequences involving El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some business with his wife & a jackass, which are in the Grandeur version, but missing from the standard version.\n\nFor the record, The Big Trail is the only one of three Fox Grandeur films which has survived in its original wide screen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in standard format.) Other studios also experimented with wide film at this time, but the only other one still known to exist in both formats is The Bat Whispers, filmed in both 65mm and 35mm, and released by United Artists. Other wide films were MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO's Danger Lights (1930), and WB's The Lash (1930), all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on Turner Classic Movies. WB's Kismet (1930) was also filmed both wide and standard, but seems to have completely disappeared; it is rumored to be lost.\n\nWhy did wide film fail in 1930? Theaters were reeling (pun intended) under the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929, and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment, and so were adverse to taking on the added expense of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate just a handful of films, photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always compatible with each other. It would not be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would try again, and this time succeed, with the introduction of wide screen CinemaScope.\n",

With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the talkies' first epic Western.\n\nJohn Wayne, pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role, looks impossibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm & masculine authority he brings to the hero's role; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star. Marguerite Churchill is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke's attentions. Dialect comic El Brendel is great fun as a Swedish immigrant beset with mule & mother-in-law woes; his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer.\n\nLooking & sounding like a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr., vast & repulsive, makes a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical similarity to John Gilbert is very apparent here.) Silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur trapper, puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use. Sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers.\n\nWhat will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early wide screen process, called Grandeur. More than living up to its name, the picture looks marvelous, with Walsh showing a mastery of the new technology. He fills the screen, every portion of it, with action. Notice during the crowd scenes, how everyone is busy doing real work, which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen. In addition, the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films. It should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive; talkies were still in their cradle. That Walsh was able to use a microphone at all, with most of the scenes shot out of doors, is more kudos for him.\n\nTHE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent Westerns. Most of the cast slipped into obscurity, including Wayne. It would not be until 1939, when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH, that John Wayne's legend would begin in earnest. And despite its grand & sweeping vistas, it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with Hollywood, largely as an answer to the economic threat from television.",

What we are watching in \"The Big Trail\" is the closest to the history of the American west that we will ever see, outside the silent classics of William S. Hart. \n\nEarly movies could use or consult people WHO HAD BEEN THERE. Of course, USC quarterback John Wayne, or even Irish thespian Tyrone Power, Sr. (who tried farming and hated it) are exceptions, but there is a ring of authenticity with \"The Big Trail\" which you can't get second hand. And if those aren't real plains Indians by the hundreds, I'll eat my breech clout!\n\nAnd the scenery! Unfortunately, cinematographers hadn't mastered filters, so the sky is always washed out, and dust and haze obscure the deep focus. But even these limitations paradoxically serve to provide a feel of endless horizons. And the locations are spectacular, especially the Indian village, which is so enormous that at first I thought half of it was backdrop. Then, there is the spectacular rope drop of animals and equipment down an escarpment that could have inspired Herzog's \"Fizcarraldo\".\n\nOf course, the acting is hammy and dialog corny, but remember, The Big Trail is from 1930 and that early sound movies had yet to evolve fully from silent film technique, which called for pantomime, with its exaggerated facial expression and movement.  Also bear in mind that the style of reading lines came directly from the theater stage from which lines, lacking voice amplification, were delivered as oratory to be heard in the back rows.\n\nRobert Flaherty in his landmark documentary \"Nanuk of the North\" actually set up his scenes dramatically. He was by no means a fly on the wall. If Flaherty could have made a documentary about the epic journey of a pioneer wagon train through the great Western prairies, I doubt if he could have achieved much greater impact than \"The Big Trail\".\n",

It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real, and I didn't detect any overt racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford, and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation.

Word has it that it failed economically, in part due to only two U.S. theatres presenting its original format (NYC's Roxy and LA's Grauman's Chinese Theatres).  The rest of the country's movie houses balked at the cost of the extra equipment necessary, after having recently converted to sound.

It's been shown on tv and in special movie houses that way on occasion.  Generally, though, one gets a standard screen version, which fails to capture the eye-popping 70 mm. aspect ratio of the original.\n\n\nThe production's statistics are impressive--a 347 cast/crew, covering 7 states in 10 weeks, replete with wagons, cattle, oxen, mules, horses, et al., retracing the first settler's trek over the Oregon trail one hundred years earlier. \n\nTwenty year old Marion Morrison was renamed John Wayne and teamed with nineteen year old Broadway actress Margurite Churchill for a hoped-for \"hot screen combination.\"  The two worked efficiently, with Wayne's untrained, natural talent in evidence. \n\nThe production looks very laborious and challenging--yet appropriate to the conditions of those early pioneers.  European \"superiority\" vs. Native American \"savagery\" is expressed in the script--establishing a skewed perspective for numerous films to follow.  Likewise, macho \"frontier justice\" is forcefully dramatized--a model for many later western efforts.\n\n\"The Big Trail,\" while a technical landmark, also presents a Hollywoodized depiction of American history.  For a more complete understanding of this period and these events, one is prone to engage in more committed and comprehensive research.  \n\n\n\n \n",

Of course everyone knows the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford directing.\n\nBut we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's fellow director Raoul Walsh spotted this tall kid on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that Fox was planning to do. The film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western The Covered Wagon.\n\nIn watching The Big Trail I was struck by how similar Wayne's character of Breck Coleman here is to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were likable young cowpokes, but both were also on a mission of vengeance. And of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them. No studio product here with a backlot western set. \n\nI also don't think that it was an accident that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era. Raoul Walsh, I'm guessing looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in sound. That's something else Walsh spotted in Wayne.\n\nAccording to what I've read The Big Trail flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process, some genius at Fox realized that their theaters weren't equipped with the wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression hit there would be no money to widen those screens at Fox movie houses. So The Big Trail got a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost money big for Fox films.\n\nMarguerite Churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine who Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne has to deal with.\n\nF. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a big burly man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the set.\n\nAlso look for Ward Bond though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bushy beard.\n\nWatching The Big Trail now it is interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career might have gone if The Big Trail had been a big hit.",

Reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed at the box office and why movie goers got the benefit of Wayne in B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was in my opinion better in \"The Big Trail\" and the years of Bs than most of his star turns after 1939 with Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy, \"True Grit\" and \"The Shootist\" being Big time exceptions.\n\nWhat a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930. Had this movie hit we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion this is not only one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialog and accurate character realization, but among the finest representations of a passage of any kind ever put on film.\n\nIt still takes my breath away. Especially the dialog and accurate characterizations of types that simply don't exist any more. Some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture that in fact hides the largest cultural degradation (into 'people like us' and 'people like them') and political divide (corporatists vs Main Streetists) in US history, but for me \"The Big Trail\" represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath them most folks wanted to work out the nation's failures and most folks aspired to build a great culture and a great nation.\n\n\"The Big Trail\" is an epic of the melting pot in motion toward the American Dream.

                "text": "I just recently bought \"The Big Trail\" {1930}. It's an awesome, amazing film. I knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent. My version is the one shot in 35mm and I'll speak of that again later. When one thinks of the Western Myth in film the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you have only half the team here, but the entire Myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation. \n\nThere is a plot centering on a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack being memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstacles\u0097both natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle, and traversing the burning Desert. The aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its master's grave.\n\nMagnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave, the Square Dance interlude and the great Buffalo herds are some that spring to mind. Marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout. Another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle Westward. Women work, fight, and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts. The finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the gigantic towering Sequoia forest to start their new life. \n\nThe acting is quite acceptable throughout. I've already mentioned Tyrone Power's scene-stealing performance. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman's sidekick, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself. The comic-relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the film.\n\nI've read much criticism of Wayne's performance\u0097some even going so far as to blame his \"wooden acting\" for the failure of the film at the box-office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in \"Stagecoach\". But he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great over-arching theme. After \"The Big Trail\", Wayne played in a large number of low-budget B Westerns. I have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them. When \"Stagecoach\" came he was ready for it and \"The Big Trail\" was a significant part of that apprenticeship.\n\nI mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in 35mm. It's still impressive, but to get some idea of the effect of the 70mm version I set the TV screen to 16:9 which doesn't cause any distortion. While not having the complete effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want to get the latter. {in addition, the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing}.\n\nAll-in-all, this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest Westerns ever made.",

                "text": "\nIf one overlooks the technical problems of this early (1930) sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of John Wayne, one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since.  Beginning at the Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga wagons, people, and animals head west.  The wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons.  Indians meet with Wayne, and allow the train to pass through their land.  Later, Indians gather west of the train to combat them.  The wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and fire their rifles creating with the circling Indians a veil of smoke.\n\nWhen the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart.  This scene is remarkable, as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart.  It is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living.  The wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere.  They finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in Oregon. The film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2.0:1 ratio (in 1930!).\n\nI haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film.  Moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie.  Given the technical limitations of the sound, the music is at times moving, such as when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end.\n\nWhile all the critics rave about The Searchers and Wayne's psychology, racism, short temper, and complex characters, The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships.

                "text": "My giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930. By the standards of films made just a few years later, this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the film sounded better and the Fox Movie Channel did show a degraded print (it DID have a lot of lines and scratches), but I assume the sound problem was always an issue. That's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the Hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads, characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality (such as what was seen in THE BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other films of the day). This was all made much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time. Quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! So, while the film was very hard to listen to, I realize that they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.\n\nThe plot is rather similar to CIMARRON--a Western that came out the following year and which captured the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON isn't all that great a film and I actually like THE BIG TRAIL more due to the scope of the film. While some might balk at THE BIG TRAIL's slow-moving pace, I saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling West on wagon trains. Plus, the whole thing just looked so beautiful, as director Raoul Walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a film version of some Ansel Adams prints.\n\nAs for the acting, it was pretty good. This was a major break for young John Wayne--as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. Here, he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less \"John Wayne-ish\" than he was in later films, as his screen persona was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (Tyrone Power's father). He looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from the Popeye cartoons! He made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.\n\nOverall, the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there. For 1930, it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON made the following year. Much of the reason THE BIG TRAIL didn't win an Oscar most likely was because ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films.",

It is a visually impressive Hollywood classic that no movie lover will want to miss.\n\nIn The Big Trail director Raoul Walsh and cinematographer Arthur Edeson make such intelligent and visually striking use of the wide screen, every scene, every shot is composed as well as an Old Master painting. Seldom has any movie of the modern wide screen era, especially a wide screen black and white, surpassed or even equaled the achievement of The Big Trail in its 70 mm version. Unfortunately, the wide screen version was exhibited in only two theaters, one in New York and one in Los Angeles, during its original 1930 release. If the general public had seen the widescreen version, instead of the simultaneously filmed 35 mm version, it is likely the movie would enjoy a better reputation today.\n\nBut the gorgeous cinematography is not The Big Trail's only good point. This is one of the most authentic looking and feeling Westerns I have ever seen. The costumes, firearms, and the dialog are just about perfect for its 1840's time frame. Filmed on location in about a half-dozen different Western states along the Oregon Trail, the picture employed an army of principle actors, extras, and behind the scene technicians, huge herds of cattle and horses, hundreds of period Conestoga wagons, and a battalion of teamsters, cowboys, and wranglers. Even what some have perceived as stilted acting works, whether intentional or not, because it transmits an impression of the formal way nineteenth century Americans spoke to each other. The early sound equipment did require the actors to speak a bit over-distinctly, especially when filming outdoors. At times they even have to shout, but even that works. Most of us who live in the West frequently find ourselves shouting to be heard over the wind. Very intelligent use is made of the sound to add to the authenticity. The sound of the wagons creaking, the livestock mooing and braying, and their drivers shouting and whipping them is heard almost continuously.\n\nThe incredibly young John Wayne -- what a natural actor he was! This was not only his first starring role but his first major role of any type, yet he acquits himself very well. Though a little green at times, he is already showing us the confident, relaxed Duke of the future. The acting of veteran stage and silent actor Tyrone Power, Sr. seems a little stagy at times, but it works for the bizarre, villainous character he plays. Marguerite Churchill and Ian Keith are the actors in the cast who displayed the best grasp of what sound movie acting should be. As another reviewer has noted, it will be difficult for young male viewers not to fall madly in love with the beautiful 19-year old Miss Churchill. But oldblackandwhite, with a half-century of adult experience dealing with the \"fair sex\" feels it his duty to warn young men against falling into the clutches of volatile, manipulative women such as the character she plays in this movie...I digress.\n\nThe Big Trail is a first rate Western in every way. A stunning visual experience and a moving and beautiful story of the hardships and travails our pioneer ancestors suffered to win the West.",

Unfortunately, time has eroded much of the sound quality of this quasi-epic, not that the original technology was that much better. \"Talkies\" had only recently hit the theaters in 1930, and \"The Big Trail\" at least had \"talking\" actors even if their acting was staged and their speaking voices all but monotone. The plot is simple: Wayne is leading a wagon train through hostile Indian territory and the weather isn't so nice either. Along the way, several really bad characters foul up the whole trip even worse, and Wayne has to chase them halfway to California before he's able to get back to his primary duties. Waiting for his return with bated-breath is Maguerite Churchill. She'll just die if anything happens to her man. She needn't worry because the bad guys (besides being bad, they're also ugly) don't stand a chance against our hero. Wayne tracks down these fellows in a blinding blizzard, and what the cold wind and snow doesn't do to them, Wayne is able to supply the finishing touch. The final showdown falls flat but the hunt supplies the film with at least a modicum of tension.

                "text": "One of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldn't make Westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location. In fact, it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre, at least in the \"A\" budget bracket. However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn had really kicked in, the \"A\" Western flourished, notable examples including The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was perhaps the biggest of them all \u0096 a gargantuan pioneer Western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur. Thanks to a recent DVD release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously.\n\nThe director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. He makes great use of the wider frame to show off the Western landscape at its most breathtaking. Very typical of Walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning, such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood. Most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly. When the wagon train gets going, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with wagons pulling away like stage curtains. These shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version, yet on the wider canvas Walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better.\n\nBut there's an unfortunate flipside to this. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box. The extra width becomes just that \u0096 extra. It may seem logical at first, because it means that height-wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture. However it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while all the background business dominates the shot \u0096 and there is a lot of background business in the Big Trail. When widescreen formats re-emerged in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake, before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up, losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen.\n\nIt's a pity, because The Big Trail is a particularly well-balanced and finely scripted effort. The romance and revenge subplots are simple but well-defined, and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story. It could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle, drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame. Still, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice comedy touches, largely courtesy of \"comical Swede\" El Brendel.\n\nThe Big Trail is also notable for being John Wayne's first lead role. While Wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes, we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery. He betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Sadly that potential wasn't widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in B-pictures before he finally hit stardom. Also appearing in this picture is Wayne's buddy (and later prolific character actor) Ward Bond. He's not credited, but you can spot him in a number of scenes, most prominently around the 80-minute mark where he is stood to Tyrone Power's left.\n\nThe Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it was this stupendous scale that would put the Western (and widescreen) to bed for some time. And although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the Western, it was by then a changed genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West \u0096 no better or worse, but of a different form. The early talkie period was the end of an era in which Westerns could be truly gigantic.",

The scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger, are astonishing in their rugged believability. Much of the film was shot outdoors, and the movie has a truly epic feel about it. The actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did, and the results are astounding. The wagons, the clothing, every single detail looks and feels right. The characters are simple but believable, with a straightforward story ,that travels like the wagon train to its destination.\n\nJohn Wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scout leading the wagons, and he does a fine job as the idealistic young frontiersman. He's up against a marvelously scurvy trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a slick gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, Senior, as the growly, bear-like trapper. Power's bearded, snarling, larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing. I keep picturing him with a bandanna, gold hoop earring and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, as he grunts and growls various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all. He nearly steals the whole picture.\n\nTully Marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is Wayne's best friend. The lovely Marguerite Churchill makes a spirited heroine, whose initial meeting with Wayne is a hilarious mix-up, resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part, to aw shucks persistence on his. The results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end.\n\nThe scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs. Indians who are clearly the genuine article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as both friends and foes, and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness.\n\nThe Big Trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew. It will probably appear naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny. There is a great deal of intentional humor, including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer, who makes loud animal sounds from hiding , every time the smooth gambler Ian Keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him. His flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks, causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures.\n\nHighly recommended, both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general.

Supporting characters include a variety of stock types: veteran westerner, comic-relief sidekick (with a penchant for making noises with his mouth!), burly and uncouth villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), his two slimy cohorts (a Mexican and a Southerner, the latter also filling in as Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand), etc. Also among the members of the wagon party is a timid Swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but who's continually put down by his irascible mother-in-law) and later Wayne regular Ward Bond.\n\nThe episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes \u0096 as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements, the Indians and themselves; the film, however, has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality. Also, the editing is somewhat choppy (particularly during the second half) \u0096 little wonder, since the DVD edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158-minute \"Grandeur\" version!",

They were big, loaded with accessories, and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen. Every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians. The wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen.\n\nThe actors clothing could not have felt more genuine. With the exception of John Wayne's buckskin outfit and Marguerite Churchill's nice dress, the clothes were very common looking, tattered, or dirty in an authentic looking way. Many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings. All the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tan.\n\nWomen of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work. In every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train, women are shown chopping wood, hauling logs, etc. This realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival.\n\nThe plot of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is overstated or overplayed.\n\nSomething was lost along the way in the 1930's in Hollywood. As much as I love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail manages to feel real above all else. The more I see big budget movies of the silent era, the more I like them. I can think of few movies of the 1930's that I have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920's.

                "text": "By 1930, Fox had already conquered making sound movies outdoors due to being an early adopter of sound on film versus sound on disc. Next they tried their hand at widescreen films. Known as 70mm Grandeur, Fox shot three films in this process, this film and two musicals - The Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and Happy Days (1929). The process was successful, the business end of their widescreen process was not. Due to the Great Depression, theaters could not afford to install the equipment necessary to show films in the Grandeur process. It's interesting to note that if sound itself had come into feature films in 1929 rather than 1927, that silent films would probably have been the majority of films made until 1940 for this same reason.\n\nThe Big Trail itself is a wonderfully modern-seeming western compared to other entries of the early sound era. It has an air of authenticity about it, as there is almost a documentary feel of the film in its depiction of harsh life on the Oregon Trail. Finally, there is the reason most people view this film - the birth of John Wayne's cowboy persona, not a cartoon character with either a black or white hat as many actors in the early westerns were, but a character of flesh and blood whose motivations you could understand and empathize with. Also note the presence of Ward Bond in a supporting role who, along with John Wayne, was a staple of the later John Ford westerns.\n\nDespite its technical beauty and the presence of John Wayne, this film flopped at the box office. John Wayne went back into obscurity and did not emerge again until nine years later in \"Stagecoach\", where he played a part very similar to the one he plays here.",

The number of times Walsh moves the camera in \"The Big Trail\" can be counted on the fingers of one hand. They include a slight long-shot pan of the Indian attack on the wagon train and the famous upward crane shot into the redwood trees at the finish. There's not much music either. In fact, it's mostly used on inter-titles and the end sequence, but there are lots of natural sound effects. All the same, the Fox Grandeur version of the movie does present great action and spectacle, but in a fixed camera series of tableaux. It seems that moving the Grandeur camera in close presented focus problems. In fact, as said above, the camera hardly ever moves.

It tells the story of settlers traveling West, from the Missouri to open, unclaimed country. It shows the hardships they endured, and the lengths they went to overcome them.\n\nOne of the most dramatic scenes is when they come to the top of a cliff, some 500 to 600 feet above where they need to go. They get down by building big winches and supports, and lowering the wagons down - a dozen winches across. Not all the wagons land in one piece.\n\nThere's an Indian attack (the wagons form a circle), the Indians are beaten back, and the settlers bury their dead.\n\nThey cross desert, rivers, mountains in winter, always going on, finally reaching that peaceful valley.\n\nThat story is held together by the story of Breck Coleman, the wagon train's scout (John Wayne, age 23, in his first leading role), Bill Thorpe - a \"Louisiana gambler and confidence man\" (Ian Keith, a leading stage and silent-screen actor), and Ruth Cameron (Margurite Churchill, 20, a \"B-movie leading lady\"), with Wayne and Keith vying for Ruth's attentions.\n\nRed Flack, the wagon train boss (Tyrone Power Sr (his son is the Tyrone Power we know) - his only taking film) complicates matters by having killed Coleman's friend a while back. Coleman finds out about that and vows to finish Flack as soon as the journey is over.\n\nComic relief is provided by Gus (El Brendel - well-known enough to get 3rd-place billing) - and he gets one of the funniest lines in the movie.\n\nColeman has two good speeches in the movie: first, before they leave, he's talking to a group of kids, who want to know if he's \"killed a dead Indian\". He tells them that he's lived with the Indians, and they've taught him the ways of the outdoors, and that they're his friends. The second is when they're in the mountains, it's winter, it's snowing, they've come through almost a year of hardship, and they're thinking of turning back. He gives the motivational talk - you can read it in the \"Quotes\" section. It worked.\n\nBesides Ward Bond, you might be able to spot Iron Eyes Cody (the Italian named Espera DeCorti). According to the archives, this was his third movie - still uncredited. He kept getting uncredited roles up till about 1967.\n\nAll the character actors are great.

                "text": "The Big Trail is a film with much historic value \u0096 not so much for its acting as for the scenery and portrayal of pioneer settings and conditions. This story centers on a wagon train at the start of the Oregon Trial migrations \u0096 about 1830. It's hard to imagine any movie firm going to the lengths to produce and shoot such a realistic film today, let alone in 1930. But that's all the more to its credit, and lends the movie its sense of reality and high historical film value. \n\nThe movie was filmed on location in the great outdoors; with more covered wagons than have probably ever been assembled for a film (perhaps 100 or so in the whole picture); and a huge Indian village and cast of many dozens, if not a few hundred, true native Americans. Note the size of the wagons themselves \u0096 with wheels as tall as a man or woman. These were no doubt some of the remaining authentic covered wagons from decades before; and their enormity belies the much smaller prairie schooners, whether authentic or reconstructed, used in later films. These wagons were indeed small homes on wheels. One can see how they could carry a stove, wardrobe, chest, vanity, trunks of clothing, dishes and cookware, and barrels of food. And still have room for three or four children. \n\nOne can't help but marvel at the filming of wagons and herds crossing rivers, getting swept away by current, and women and children jumping from wagons, swimming and grabbing onto horses. Or of the descent down the steep cliffs to a valley below. That would have been along the Snake River in Idaho. The scenes show ropes with pulleys rigged onto fresh-hewn log supports, and bands of men slowly releasing the ropes to lower wagons, oxen, and cattle down the steep cliff. What reality in the filming of heavy rain storms, wagons and animals and riders sinking in mud, people pushing their oxen and livestock through the torrents and knee-deep water and mud! This movie preserves most realistically, what it must have been like for the pioneers who traveled 2,000 miles across unsettled land in the longest human migration known in history.\n\nOverall, the quality of the surviving film (on my DVD) is poor, but not such that one can't enjoy this film. This is only John Wayne's second credited movie of nearly two dozen since 1926. And the first using his new stage name, John Wayne. His first credited film was also his first \"talkie.\" In \"Words and Music\" of 1929, he was listed in the credits as Duke Morrison. The acting here seems hammy at times and overdone. It's likely because this is the time of transition from silent to sound movies; and some of the exaggerated acting (especially facial expressions) were still evident. Those were important in the silent films to convey to audiences emotions, feelings and thoughts that later would be conveyed by voice and dialog. So, there is some historical interest in the acting as well, for this reason. \n\nFor all the realism and effort to portray the conditions of a real time in history, the film's few deviations from accuracy can stand out if you're a student of the history of the time, or if you have traveled the Oregon Trail route in modern times. It appears that perhaps 75 percent of the large bands of Indians were chiefs \u0096 or elders, by their huge headdresses; and there were so few younger braves. Nowhere along the Oregon Trail is there a desert, as implied and shown in the film. The trail did cross arid regions and skirt some high desert country across Wyoming and into southern Idaho. And, the scenes of massive mountains toward the end appear to be more in Yosemite National Park or in the Colorado Rockies than of the mountains the wagon trains would have passed by or gone over at the end \u0096 the Cascades and Mount Hood. For a film that captures the true mountain scenery at the end of the Oregon Trail, see \"Bend of the River.\" \n\nPerhaps one day, a film museum or historic entity will clean up and restore this film, and transfer it to a digital format for preservation and future showing and enjoyment. \"The Big Trail\" is somewhat of a classic for its authenticity and scope, and surely deserves a spot in collections of important movies.",

                "text": "Released towards the end of 1930 across the United States to an early depression era audience, Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail is a fictitious documentation of the crossing of the Oregon Trail by a large convoy of settlers and trappers. The episodic narrative details the trials and adversity faced by the immigrants, often in the form of hostile terrain, extreme climate and the threat of violence from indigenous tribes, as they are guided by scout Breck Coleman from the banks of the Mississippi river to a fabled land 'north of Oregon'. In this essay, we will observe the utilization of Genre and Representation by the filmmakers and the resulting effects they have on the message and meaning of the film and their impact on the audience.\n\nA large number of immigrants, seeking freedom and land, collect on the banks of the Mississippi river to decide where to go. Breck Coleman, a young man without family or allegiance who has lived for long among the natives of the land, takes onto the wagon train as a scout when he learns that the men who he suspects to have killed his friend may be on it as well. Amidst the fury of nature and other hardships faced by the wagon train, Coleman keeps a lean eye on the suspects who attempt to murder him several times. The film ends as the suspects run off when Coleman finally decides to strike back against them, and choosing between his love interest newly settled in the valley he had led the immigrants to and chasing after the murderers, Coleman decides to avenge his friend before returning to his lover.\n\nIn 1929, the collapse of the American stock market quickly led, due to the failure of banks and businesses, to a rise in unemployment from 3.3% to nearly 12% by the end of 1930, which is when The Big Trail was released. Films of the Western genre usually present the audience with a historical fantasy allure, and films recent to the time such as The Iron Horse and The Great K & A Train Robbery were entertaining, often grandiose productions that explored heroics and frontier lifestyles while being largely irrelevant to the era at hand. The release of The Big Trail coincided with a period when such escapism would be keenly sought by an economically bereft public. Instead, however, the film-goers were presented with the plight of a people not unlike themselves, opting out of situations of unemployment and poverty for an escapism of their own. In the old west culture where means of income were limited, the ownership of land was a huge step towards respect and power. In fact, only white land-owners were allowed to vote until 1870. Moving away from established townships and cities enabled the commonest of labourers to transform their fortunes and live in a society where they could establish themselves and have a say in its functioning. Indeed, the images of the many assembled wagons assembled repeated throughout the film closely bear a striking resemblance to images of squatter camps found across the US in this period.\n\nThroughout the film, title cards are displayed to describe the hardships they are to face. While perfectly applicable to the film's plot, they also reflect, often obtusely, their significance to the plight of the American people at the time. The directness of some of these title cards result in expanding the message beyond usual ideological functions of genre into the realm of blatant didactics\n\n\"The central theme of the genre became the conflict between the civilized order and the lawless frontier\" write Bordwell and Thompson (2006). As significant as this statement is in the macrocosm of the plot and story, with thousands of wayward settlers battling against forces of nature and other threats domestic to the territory, Coleman participates in the trail to seek revenge for the murder of his friend at the hands of Red Flack. At one point Coleman proclaims, \"I am the law\"Chapter 25, 1:32:36. It is his wish to avenge his friend, and thus provide a fitting punishment for Flack's lawless actions. The civilization versus wilderness theme is continued in the microcosm of the exodus, manifested by Coleman as a frontier judge chasing after the 'renegade whites' that murdered his friend. \n\nColeman also finds this central conflict to exist inside of himself as he chooses between remaining with Ruth wrapped deeply within the arms of civilization or hunting down Flack in the free and relentless manner of the noble savage.\n\nFred Camper (1988) writes of The Big Trail's imagery, \"His (Walsh's) images, with their emphasis on landscape as texture rather than on landscape as geography or as human character, produce in sum a kind of mental image of a weighty mass, like the surface of a rock, or of the ground, or even of the dust-filled air. This mass is also empty, in the sense of being devoid of detail, a true metaphor for trackless wilderness. It is this emptiness that our civilization has devoted itself to filling, both materially and mentally.\" This sense of purpose and utilization is the motivation of the thousands of immigrants, best reflected in the leader of the Missouri outfit, Pa Bascomb. He represents the facets of society the whole train wants to see prosper at the other end of the trail. He manifests a clear sense of law and democracy, as evidenced by his insistence on a fair trial for Red Flack after his failed attempt to murder Coleman. He also embodies a deeply religious spirit which the entire wagon train shares, there is a mass prayer at the beginning and end of the journey. \n\nIt is interesting to think that one of Hollywood's first sound Westerns had such a resounding ideology, one it delivered upon its audience hearkening them to remember the qualities of America's founding fathers and involve their ideals into their own lives.",

It is not an accurate predictor of stardom for Wayne, and indeed he would not become a \"star\" until some years later, after cow-punching and roping off the bad guys in countless poverty row \"oaters\", and giving new meaning to the phrase \"horse opera\" ( along with Ritter, Maynard, Scott, Mix, Gibson, and a whole host of others). But he did eventually rise to the top of his game, and when you see this film, there are indications as to how it came about. The \"John Wayne\" character is here, not fully developed and not entirely believable because of his youth, but we can look down the road and see things to come. This film has all of the technical shortcomings of most films of that period, but since most of the shots are exteriors, it does not come off too badly. It never hurts to have Arthur Edeson in charge of cinematography. He was already something of a legend in Hollywood by mere virtue of having been chosen by D W Griffith personally to replace yet another cinematographic legend, Billy Bitzer...and some of his best work was yet to come, with films that we all have come to regard as classics. This flick is kind of a \"Grand Hotel of the Prairie\", with pioneers crossing the Oregon Trail and facing odds that seem impossible at times. It is also interspersed with personal stories, and scores to settle. Wayne, who plays a scout, has one to settle with two saddle-tramps who murdered his partner. When first offered the scouting job, he scoffs at it. But the trail of evidence leads him to believe the bad guys he is after might be in or near this wagon caravan, so he signs on. The adventures, hardships, loss of life, and extreme measures that must be resorted to at times, all come together to make this something of an entertaining watch. Also, not a bad music score. Scores were rare in these early vehicles unless the film was a musical or one of the silents, which were still being made in 1930, but which were becoming extremely rare. The scoring here is a nice touch, even for the 1930s, when sound tracks were still relatively new, and studios and theaters alike had to revert to sound...or perish. Not too bad an outing for Duke, though we know there were better things to come.",

Anticipating the Cinemascope and Panavision westerns of later decades, director Raoul Walsh captures the spirit and vitality of Manifest Destiny with several stunning wide screen wilderness vistas using the aptly named Grandeur Process, calling to mind the luminous, larger-than-life frontier canvasses of Albert Bierstadt. Technically quite accomplished for its time (few early sound features dared to venture out of doors), the film mixes broad and sometimes embarrassing melodrama with meticulous period detail, adding a little primitive slapstick for comic relief.",

In 1930, we are seeing many \"firsts\" but few \"bests.\" Besides the first John Wayne film, we have here the first widescreen film (although we only watched the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which hadn't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity. All the same, this film was extremely good, giving us a harrowing look at the trek to Oklahoma. The opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind, about America, about the land, who should live on it, etc., and is an excellent demonstration of that. Walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness (when they reach a cliff, they must rope each wagon down one by one), and we also get a revenge subplot involving Wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends (I seem to recall something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there, and would surely evolve further in subsequent films. Since this film is representing all of Wayne's early 30's work for the Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but once we do, we will keep seeing him to the end of the Odyssey and beyond.\n\nKEVIN: Ah, our first sound western, and John Wayne's first starring role. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be short, since it's been weeks since I watched it. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. The mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises, like when the brains of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) is killed half way through; I thought he would be the boss at the end, but that ended up being Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember that I didn't like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and exacts revenge at the end. I understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story, but I really didn't like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he has to do it. I think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west.\n\nLast film viewed: Animal Crackers (1930). Last film chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).",

                "text": "THE BIG POND (Paramount, 1930), directed by Hobart Henley, is a familiar story that has the makings of a very fine \"rich girl loving common man\" plot had it been made a few years into the decade when the cycle of screwball comedies was at its peak. Starring the energetic Frenchman Maurice Chevalier, THE BIG POND pairs him for the first time opposite another French native gone Hollywood, Claudette Colbert. Colbert's role as the daughter of a self-made millionaire appears to have been a dress rehearsal for her, for that she was to play a similar role in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), and winning an Academy Award for her performance. While this is far from being worthy of an Academy Award for Colbert, it is Chevalier who was nominated, along with his earlier work in THE LOVE PARADE (1929). Although worthy for the nomination for THE LOVE PARADE, THE BIG POND offers nothing new nor challenging for Chevalier's acting talent except for his popularity at the time. Based on the stage play by George Middleton and A.E. Thomas, the title of THE BIG POND is categorized as a ocean between the home of the central character (Venice) and the place he hopes to make his home with his new found bride (America).\n\n\"Springtime in Venice\" is the opening title as the scenario fades into the locale in Italy where the vacationing Barbara Billings (Claudette Colbert), the American daughter of an impoverished family whose father owns Billings Pepsin Chewing Gum, has met and fallen in love with her guide, Pierre Mirande (Maurice Chevalier). Although Pierre meets with the approval of her mother, Emily (Marion Ballou), this relationship doesn't rest well with both her father, Henry (George Barbier), who takes him for a fortune hunter after her money, and her fianc\u00e9, Ronnie (Frank Lyons), who happens to be her father's associate. In order to please Barbara and discourage Pierre, Henry decides to offer Pierre a position at his chewing gum factory upon their return home in the states, and won't approve of their marriage until he proves himself successful. While there, Pierre is given the business, with Ronnie, now the rejected suitor, finding him a place to live in a shabby boarding house, which is run by a French landlady, while Henry makes sure things do not come easy for Pierre during his employment at the plant. Pierre, whose ambition is to earn $20,000 a year, works so hard that by the end of the day be becomes overly exhausted, causing him to miss attending Barbara's social function as he spends the entire night sleeping in bed while dressed up in his evening clothes. While Henry feels his plan is working, especially since that Barbara being stood up has caused her to change her mind about marrying Pierre, he soon finds that the joke will be on him.\n\nThe small list of supporting players consists of Nat Pendleton as Pat O'Day; Andree Corday as Toinette; and Elaine Koch as Jennie. Koch, a child of about 10, whose performance comes as a cross between other child actresses, Mitzi Green and Sybil Jason, makes her movie debut as well as her final screen appearance. She plays an orphan who works at the boarding house who, like many others, becomes very fond of Pierre. She has one heartwarming scene where she sings the overly tired Pierre to sleep. Whatever became of her?\n\nThe musical soundtrack for THE BIG POND includes: \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me,\" (by Irving Kahal and Sammy Fain/French lyrics by Pierre Norman); \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" (reprised by Chevalier, harmonized by Colbert); \"Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight\" (by Al Lewis and Al Sherman; \"You Brought a New Kind of 'Gum' to Me\" and \"This Is My Lucky Day\" by Lew Brown, B.G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson. If the song \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" sounds familiar, its introduction by Chevalier is overshadowed by the Four Marx Brothers, who immortalized it in one of their best comedies, MONKEY BUSINESS (1931) which features a highlight scene where they are each seen imitating Chevalier by separately reciting and/or singing the opening lyrics, \"If the nightingales could sing like you ...\" The song became popular for Chevalier, in spite of his four reprises and over exposure in its underscoring, that after a while, grows tiresome.\n\nWhile the premise for THE BIG POND is good, it suffers today, as with most early talkies, due to slow pacing and lack of musical underscoring under the dialog or in between scenes. With future comedy director Preston Sturges credited as one of the scriptwriters, one would expect some funny one-liners or witty dialog, but it the final print, it has little to offer except Chevalier, who manages to liven things up a bit, especially when singing to the associates during a business meeting of \"Loving in the Moonlight\" while holding or wearing his trademark straw hat.\n\nRarely shown on television, availability to THE BIG POND on video cassette has been located through a private collector. Audio is fine but picture quality is poor mainly to its occasional fade in and fade out darkness. Though not as better known as some of his earlier works, THE BIG POND is among Chevalier's other list of forgotten film titles during his Paramount years (1929-1933), including INNOCENTS OF Paris (1929), PLAYBOY OF Paris (1930), A BEDTIME STORY and THE WAY TO LOVE (both 1933). THE SMILING LIEUTENANT (1931), which reunited him with Colbert for the second and last time, has become a rediscovered gem and an improvement over THE BIG POND, thanks to director Ernst Lubitsch. While THE BIG POND may not be the best film for both of them, there's no harm done in watching Chevalier and Colbert early in their careers. (**)",

Barbara (Claudette Colbert), the rather spoiled daughter of the wealthy Billings family, falls for Pierre during the family's European vacation. When her father first finds out that Barbara wants to marry this man, he explodes. But then he reconsiders. He figures his best option is to take Barbara's side, take Pierre back to America with them, put him to work in the family business - they make chewing gum , and show Barbara that he could never fit in.\n\nSo this boils down to your basic fish out of water story, but Pierre is a very sincere and charming Gallic guppy. In America he wins over everyone from his rooming house landlady who also happens to be French to his gruff coworker (Nat Pendleton) who was instructed to \"give Pierre the business\" by Mr. Billings but lightens up after he just can't help liking the guy.\n\nHowever, Pierre's blessings - his quick wit and likability - are also a curse. His reluctant father-in-law to be soon finds Pierre quite the idea man and pretty soon Pierre has worked himself up from hard physical labor to a nice job and a nice office to match. This has him spending much time at work, neglecting Barbara, and even turning his love song to Barbara into a chewing gum jingle much to Barbara's dislike. Will things work out for Pierre and Barbara? Watch and find out.\n\nChevalier is pretty much the whole show in this one since it really is Pierre's story - Claudette Colbert is not given that much to do. Maybe that's a good thing since she is playing a very spoiled girl that must think the money with which she parties is heaven sent since she is so opposed to the men in her life working long hours and upsetting her social calendar. But this is a comedy, so her excesses and shortcomings are not explored here. The song \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" gets reprised to the point of excess, but still it manages to not wear out its welcome.",

But when Chevalier accidentally spills some bootleg rum on a vat of chewing gum and creates a new flavor, he's proclaimed a genius.\n\nChevalier was nominated for Best Actor for this role and for The Love Parade, but he lost to George Arliss for Disraeli. I don't think The Big Pond is anywhere near as good as The Love Parade, but it has its moments. \n\nMaurice got two hit songs from the score of The Big Pond, You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me and Living In The Sunlight Loving In the Moonlight. The former you may remember served as the title of a film that starred Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward and the song was sung over the opening credits by Frank Sinatra. But it gained even more lasting success only a year later in the Marx Brothers comedy Monkey Business when Harpo 'sang' the song with a Victrola and Chevalier's 78 RPM record strapped to his back as the brothers were disembarking a ship.\n\nClaudette sparkles as the leading lady and she shows more than a trace of the comic talent that would burst four years later in It Happened One Night. And George Barbier who is a favorite character actor of mine plays another exasperated father concerned for his daughter, a part he would patent over his career.\n\nI wonder though, did the Wrigley family ever think marketing rum flavored gum at Cubs games?",

                "text": "Originally planned to highlight the talents of another up and coming Paramount player, Charlie Ruggles, it was quickly adapted to Maurice Chevalier's larger than life talent when \"The Love Parade\" proved such a big hit!! Chevalier proved he was completely at home in both light operetta and contemporary comedy with songs and \"The Big Pond\" gave him one of his standards - \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" which in 1930 instantly joined \"Louise\" in his repertoire, the fact that it was played endlessly throughout the film didn't worry anyone.\n\nChevalier played Pierre Mirande, an immigrant determined to make good and trying to cope with a snooty American family - and who did Paramount get to play Barbara, a typical American girl, why Claudette Colbert of course, who was almost as French as Maurice!! Newly hired dialogue director Preston Sturges not only rewrote the dialogue (it was taken from a 1928 Broadway play that lasted 47 performances), he altered the plot and characterizations so it resembled his own Broadway hit \"Strictly Dishonourable\".\n\nWithin minutes Pierre has confessed to Barbara Billings that \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\". She is an American heiress caught up in the heady atmosphere of Venice but of course her father and Ronnie, her would be suitor, believe Pierre is a fortune hunter. They hatch a scheme to bring Pierre to America and completely discourage him by working him to a frazzle in the Billings Chewing Gum Factory. Back in New York Barbara assumes that Pierre is being treated with kingly respect but sneaky Ronnie has directed him to a seedy boarding house but is dismayed to see his French charm and good humour make him a real favourite with all the tenants - especially the land lady. His breezy spirits and hard work in the factory gradually thaw the hard hearted father and when Pierre hits upon the idea of creating an alcohol flavoured chewing gum (after a factory accident) the sky's the limit. Barbara is less than impressed as she sees her light hearted lover turn into a workaholic businessman but Pierre hasn't really changed - he is just trying his best to earn the $20,000 a year that Ronnie hinted he needed to win his girl!!\n\nThis satire on big business was a bit of a come down from the scintillating \"The Love Parade\". Funniest scenes were those that kidded Chevalier's confusion with American slang, especially at the boarding house dinner which ends with him being considered a regular guy by his fellow workers. At a presentation he launches into a typical \"sing to the audience\" song with the bubbling \"Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight\" and just before the end he can hardly contain himself as he sings \"Lucky Day\" (he sings it to Jenny. She is a little girl at the boarding house and there is a really sweet interplay between them). For me, they are the only scenes that the Chevalier exuberance really shines through and I think they are the high point of the movie.\n\nClaudette Colbert does nicely as the love interest, she even sings a bit, but she is not over taxed and seems to disappear during the last half of the movie.\n\nRecommended.",

Although the film is stagy (especially the over-acting of George Barbier), I found it quite enjoyable. Having just seen (for the 20th time) the Marx Brothers \"Monkey Business\", I wanted to see the Chavalier film that introduced the song, \"You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me\" to movie audiences. You get a healthy dose of the song throughout this film, but it's such a great song, I was happy to hear its various reprises, vocal and instrumental. Another excellent Chevalier song from this film, \"Living In The Sunlight, Loving In The Moonlight\" brought back memories of Tiny Tim's rendition of this song on his \"God Bless Tiny Tim\" album.

There is virtually no action, most of the scenes take place in a kitchen and a barn, and Davies speaks her entire dialogue, often in French, with a very thick accent. But she is so lively and full of joie de vivre, so infectiously good-natured even when angry, even mimicking Chevalier & Bernhardt, and impersonating a young male officer, that she becomes the main reason for watching the film today. It is indeed unfortunate that Marion Davies' gifts have become obscured and her films nearly forgotten.\n\nLawrence Gray, who had shown much skill as a comic actor during Silent days and had worked with Davies then, here plays the American doughboy who falls for Marion. The funny business is handled by two of MGM's newest acquisitions, Yiddish dialect comedian Benny Rubin and ukulele-playing Cliff Edwards. Marion's noble French boyfriend is enacted by George Baxter.\n\nAs with many other early sound films, the movie suffers with too much talk. However, the recurring musical sequences are mostly quite welcome. The opening scene, with its idyllic look at Marion's village, shows the quality of art direction for which MGM was famous.\n\nAnd pity the poor pig Anatole!",

It is, therefore, rather puzzling to see her in this poorly scripted movie for her debut in talkies. The entire first half of the film is devoted to a leering bunch of American soldiers relentlessly pursuing Davies for sexual favors and her efforts to repulse them. This part of the film is a one trick pony that drags on for far too long.\n\nThe film only begins to roll when the American soldier with whom Davies has become smitten is carted off to the guard house. After she successfully pleads with the American general for the young soldier's release, it again slows down for a barrage of songs all bunched together. In between, Davies gives a hilarious, Chaplinesque impersonation of a French lieutenant. It is a poorly paced film featuring an utterly charming, talented actress who has a real natural presence - especially for the era. This makes her acting seem ahead of its time. She is undeniably the first screwball comedienne - again, long before anybody had ever heard the term.\n\nMarion Davies does something in this film that I can remember no other American actress' doing. She adopts a heavy French accent for the entire film, and for a large portion of it she speaks and SINGS in what seems to me to be nearly flawless French! A couple of years later, she would similarly adopt an authentic Irish brogue for the title role in Peg O My Heart, perhaps her best remembered film - and one I highly recommend. She clearly had a remarkable ear for accents.\n\nWatch this film for an incredible performance by one of America's great actresses and Hollywood's most compassionate humanitarians.

Considering this is an early sound film you have to expect some of the rather poor sound quality but Davies performance will have her fans wanting to check this out. There's really not too much story here and certainly not enough to carry a 112-minute film. The movie runs a tad bit too long because it's quite predictable so getting to the ending takes quite a while especially when you know who she's going to fall in love with. The music sequences are all rather strange because they pop out of anywhere and the film doesn't try to hide the fact that many of those doing the singing really aren't that talented in the field. The rather bland singing makes for an interesting experiment and in some ways it makes the film seem almost surreal but at the same time the bad singing works against the \"musical\" aspect of the film. Davies gets to belt out a couple lines but they're hidden within some comedy. Either way, she turns in a fine comic performance even though her French accent isn't the greatest. The think accent is also hard to understand at times due to the sound quality but it's only a minor problem.

Davies is admired by several U.S. soldiers, but mostly Lawrence Gray (as Stagg). Mr. Gray helps retrieve Davies' stolen pig, albeit mostly eaten.\n\nThere are several embarrassing scenes, but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin (Sam) and Cliff Edwards (Soapy) serenading a distraught Davies. This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends, in drag, while bragging about her intimacy with a General. Later on, she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt. They are not as fun as they sound! Mr. Rubin sings \"The Girl from Neufch\u00e2teau\" extremely well, though; his is the film's best musical performance.\n\nThe best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep, with Gray; she is still disguised as a male officer, complete with moustache and a cap. The scene works because Davies, instead of playing a French woman, play-acts a French officer. Here, she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures. You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball; especially, recall Ms. Ball's \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\" (1960).

Shortly after you see them get engaged, the war begins and he has already been gone for four over years when the bulk of the movie takes place. The war has just ended but American soldiers are still in France awaiting transport home. In the meantime, one company is stationed near Marianne's farmhouse and so they spend most of the movie trying to score with this lovely French girl, but she is too chaste and gives each one the brush off--that is until late in the film she falls for one of them. But what to do? She's engaged to a Frenchman and also loves an American--and how all this is resolved is something you'll just need to see for yourself.\n\nI don't know if MARIANNE was originally a musical play, but I assume it was based on the look and style of the film. Any sound movie made in 1929 suffers when seen today due to poor sound--this is just a fact. Since the use of sound was still pretty new, these films tended to have lots of problem with fluctuating sound and actors were forced to stand close together and movie very little so they could be properly recorded--making the films look very stilted and this was especially a problem with musicals. Despite this, for 1929, MARIANNE was actually much better than most, as the sound, though poor, is definitely better than most of its contemporaries. But because the actors couldn't move around much, it still did have a rather stiff and claustrophobic feel. But again, you can't blame this film for this and you really can't compare MARIANNE to musicals made just a few years later. If I were reviewing it in 1929, I might be so bold as to give the movie a 9--it WAS very good and despite some negative comments about Marion Davies' performance, I thought she was just lovely and carried off the French accent reasonably well.\n\nNow because the film is so archaic and the songs were just okay, by today's standards a more appropriate score might be a 5 or 6. It is just a time-passer because of the technical limitations. Because of this, I'm splitting the difference and giving it a 7--recognizing it was great for its day but also that compared to later musicals it's not especially great. In many ways, it's more a film for film historians and true cinephiles.\n\nBy the way, it sure would have helped had this film been closed captioned. My hearing isn't especially great, but most people would benefit from this if it were available due to the archaic sound equipment.",

And the drinking problem was spot-on, whether anyone at the time wanted to admit it or not.\n\nDon't bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as I really couldn't care less.",

In this one he shows up, deals with a couple of stooges, then goes into his sailor-suited act in which he sings a couple of songs and tells a bunch of jokes about his family. You can see the talent here, but this film doesn't really work more than as a record of a good stage act -- which is worth a lot in and of itself.\n\nThe issue is that this act is staged, modulated and shot as if Mr. West is in a vaudeville house and that is a big venue with a different sort of intimacy than a movie screen. This act, which might easily have been shot straight had Mr. West pitched it differently, or if it had been shot with more background action -- an audience, say. But as it is, it just doesn't quite work.",

Whenever one goes into these shorts you never really know what you're going to get other than a recorded performance of a part of history that has mostly been forgotten. The acts are either going to be entertaining or they're going to be really bad but more often than not they're at least interesting to watch. I found West's act to be pretty good and this includes a rather nice version of \"Dumb Dora\" that has the performer singing it well but also acting out some funny bits. I also thought the comedy routine was better than what you typically see in these shorts. This includes a sequence where West is joking on his family including his drunk father as well as fat women. I guess these are some of the earliest fat jokes to ever be recorded for film. Again, there's nothing ground-breaking here but the film is entertaining in its own way and West manages to make you pay attention to him.",

You have to forget you are a film buff (you are, aren't you?) and think of it as a collection of pop videos from 1930. And the pop ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous: My Heart Is Saying, in colour (?) nicely sung by Helen Burnell but danced atrociously, to Only A Working Man in b&w by the incomparable Lily Morris. Praise the Lord this film was made if only for her two turns, also the Will Fyffe bits and the Cicely Courtneidge end song, I'm Falling In Love. How that one passed the censor at the time I'll never know ... I suppose no one told him!\n\nHelen Burnell must have been the dancing inspiration for Jessie Matthews, or did all Show People dance like hippos pretending to be trees in the 20's? I've always loved the work of Jack Hulbert, mainly for his innocent British enthusiasm (and songs), but I'm afraid that he looked like a manic bus conductor in his one dance scene. Rotund Teddy Brown was marvellous to listen to - until he started telling jokes; The 3 Eddies - ah! Can you just imagine them walking on stage and launching into their high powered act nowadays? Horrified silence would follow, but how times and tastes have changed. The song Ladies Maids Always In The Know sung and danced to by the Charlot Girls would likewise be incomprehensible to nearly everyone too.\n\nThe glue that 'holds' all this and more together is supplied by Gordon Harker trying to get a picture of it all on his TV and Tommy Handley as TV linkman, with some surprisingly flat gags for a change. A running gag is supplied by Donald Calthrop attempting to perform Shakespeare; Anna May Wong puts him in his place - have you ever seen 'Taming of the shrew' with a massive custard pie fight or with a circling riderless motorcycle being whipped?\n\nIf you're going to watch this for the Hitchcock bits and are unmusical you won't like it, but if you can open your ears and hearts to these fine personalities from a bygone age then like me you may get something like innocent merriment from Elstree Calling.",

Some of the highlights are: The Three Eddies, a top African American tap dance team that made a big success in the U.K.; they dance two numbers in this revue. Two numbers also by Lily Morris are great giggle (\"Why Am I Always the Bridesmaid\" is gem of character comedy.) Cicely Courtneidge closes the movie in a production number in color, doing an amusing song & eccentric dance. And Donald Calthrop interrupts the proceedings a number of times as an actor willing to do anything to get his moment in the spotlight. A couple of color production numbers are campy at best, but the film's strength is the individual 'turns' by its variety stars. Ellstree Calling was one of the most successful early talkies anywhere in the world: it was translated into 11 languages and made a fortune through the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other British outposts around the globe. -- Frank Cullen American Vaudeville Museum and Vaudeville Times quarterly",

                "text": "In producing this brand-new singing, dancing, all-talkie film, British International Pictures inadvertently contrived to preserve a cross-section of the contemporary London stage scene from the West End to the music halls. Sit back in your seat, enjoy the entertainment beamed directly to your home (I had no idea that television existed in the popular perception long before the BBC), and let yourself be carried away back to the days of 1930, flitting from venue to venue to experience a night out in the London of the era. Some of the acts are to one taste, some to another, but you've paid for the programme as a whole so applaud and wait to see what's coming next.\n\nMy personal favourite would be the live-wire tapping and jazzy tunes of the Three Eddies' blackface act (especially the skeleton dance!), but while overall I was interested in this revue chiefly for the music -- it features unknown (at least to me) tunes by Vivian Ellis and Ivor Novello, for example -- there's a good deal else that's worth enjoying, and a few tantalising glimpses 'backstage' at the Elstree studios as well.\n\n\"Elstree Calling\" was edited on the cheap and rushed out in ten days for a hasty release to recoup the cost of production, and it shows. Few of the five or six camera angles filmed on every shot actually got used, for instance, and a number of bizarre choices seem to have been made, such as choosing to show a dance sequence via a camera focused too high and showing a vast expanse of curtain above the performers' heads but cutting off their actual feet -- or a shot that shows the performers disappearing off the left-hand side of the frame while focusing on the empty set centre-stage. Did anybody even take the trouble to screen these clips before attaching them together? (Director Adrian Brunel, who had left detailed directions for the compilation of his footage only for them to be totally ignored, complained in his autobiography \"How could the Hulbert-Courtneidge numbers be slung together like that without looking like casual newsreel photographing?\") \n\nI was also a bit puzzled by the smoke that appears to be pouring out of the top of the jaw-droppingly gigantic image of 'Little' Teddy Brown in the background of his first musical interlude -- presumably a side-effect of the stage lighting? But it isn't just the editing: certainly in the chorus sequences, the choreography tends to suffer from being cramped onto a film set, while no-one seems to yet have worked out how to avoid having a long line of girls strung out across the middle of a square-format screen. (See, e.g. the chorus sequences in British-Gaumont's \"First a Girl\" for more sophisticated treatment later in the Thirties.)\n\nStill, I found this glimpse onto the theatre world of the era thoroughly enjoyable: it was particularly interesting after having screened the shorts in the silent \"On With the Dance\" series of only a few years only, since the styles are very similar but obviously this time with music. Just don't expect cinema: theatre is what is advertised, and theatre is what you will get -- though there is a brief homage to the antics of Douglas Fairbanks in the burlesque \"Taming of the Shrew\" that closes the act!",

To a Hitchcock fanatic like myself (Vic Evans)I would say \"Yes!\" but to any person other than a movie historian I would say \"Forget it!\"\n\nIt is a collection of skits and songs with a bit of comedy in the form of a\nLondon stage musical and comedy \"Vaudeville\" revue. Revues like this one have been done on the London stage from time to time since Vaudeville days. I remember seeing one in London in 1974 called \"Carry On London\" with Sid James and many other members of the \"Carry On\" movie comedy crew.\n\n\"Elstree Calling\" (1930) is presented in the form of a very early live TV broadcast hosted by Tommy Handley. You also see a family attempting to tune into this program. Every so often between skits, you see how they are making out. They experience great difficulty throughout the show. The picture comes and goes as they attempt to adjust the set. The TV set even blows up and is later repaired. By the end of the presentation, the reception finally is restored and the program ends. The problems with this new medium (television) is one of the running jokes.\n\nTo the audiences of today it is of little interest. The singing, dancing and comedy is standard for this type of English variety show of the day but terrible by today's standards. For dancing, think of \"The Pleasure Garden\" as a comparison. Those familiar with Hitchcock's work may remember \"Mr. Memory\" from \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\".  The music hall in that film is a similar setting.  Alfred Hitchcock said to Francois Truffaut about this film - `Not good.'\n\nThere is little evidence of Hitchcock except perhaps for a short scene about a murder of the \"wrong man\". You should recognise the Hitchcock touch in it.\n\nWhile I don't think anyone knows for sure, I have read that Alfred Hitchcock may have been responsible for the TV broadcast/TV viewing family framework that links the skits together and a running gag with Donald Calthrop attempting to recite Shakespeare periodically throughout the broadcast.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nVic Evans (marmalade_man [NOSPAM] at yahoo.com",

Luckily, too many cooks did not spoil the broth in this case but created a marvelous musical and comedic souffl\u00e9. The film is a series of vaudeville-type skits and sketches. Tommy Handley hosts the show. \"Think, and having thunk, think again,\" Handley humorously advises the audience. \n\nThe sections vary in quality but none are poor. Among the best: Teddy Brown whistling while playing the xylophone; lovely, blonde, and ethereal Helen Burnell in a sparkling sequined gown singing; a sprightly Russian-style song and dance number; Cicely Courtnedge singing an entrancing rendition of I'm Falling In Love; and Jack Hulbert and Helen Burnell in a dynamic duet. One brief sketch is darkly humorous as a man appears to enter a home, shoot the man and woman he \"catches\" kissing, only to realize, \"I'm in the wrong flat!\" \n\nIn one section, bagpipes play while a Scotsman in a kilt sings about how \"happiness costs such a lot.\" It is wonderfully sung but some viewers may be offended by the way it plays on the stereotype of the Scots as stingy.\n\nFar more viewers are apt to be offended by the sketches done by \"The Three Eddies.\" The tap dancers are in blackface with white lips, white bowler hats, and white-rimmed round eyeglasses. Their tap dancing is wonderfully skilled but one does not have to be a stickler for \"political correctness\" to be disturbed by the racist stereotyping in their act. \n\nA better note is struck in a skit in which Elstree Calling appears to play with racial (not necessarily racist expectations). In an odd take on The Taming of the Shrew, Anna Mae Wong is the clearly Asian daughter of a white man. Beautiful Wong appears as Katherine in a shiny and revealing outfit. Instead of being \"tamed,\" this \"shrew\" gets her revenge by throwing cream pies in the faces of all the men around her \u0096 including Shakespeare himself!\n\nLike many works from past time periods, Elstree Calling sometimes strikes an \"off\" chord with contemporary audiences. Nevertheless, it is a fast-paced and fun series. One hour and twenty-six minutes long, it never drags but is a very entertaining potpourri of performances.",

It is far more like you are watching actors playing around with the outline of a different, unmade movie, while the cameras just happen to be rolling.\n\nFor example, there's the line \"Call your shots Sheriff, you're not at a SWIMMING pool\", which would work had they been playing pool, but they're all at the dinner table (each seeming to be waiting to say their next little joke); the line is just casually and randomly thrown out there, and it makes little sense in the context used. It's almost as if someone found an old joke book and decided to use all the gags in a short time without the considerations for where and how the jokes would work. There isn't even as much mystery as is implied.\n\nSadly, it is a sinking ship about eight minutes in, and the climax and the ending are embarrassing. Even though the plot is fairly simple (with regard to who is really who), it comes off as totally incoherent.\n\n3/10.\n\nIf you are looking around for something like this, you should check out \"The Bee's Buzz\" (from the same company) which is nearly flawless and very well-made from start to finish.

The actors seem to have no sense of comic timing, and deliver their lines stiffly and hesitantly, as if perhaps they haven't quite finished learning them. This is with the exception of reliable comedians Vernon Dent and Andy Clyde, who has a funny characterization as a sheriff, but doesn't get much to do with it.\n\nTypical Sennett comedies were fast paced and full of wild stunts and sight gags. This one is glacially paced and relies on verbal humor -- badly. The short alternates between the characters sitting around not doing much, and the characters stiffly and inappropriately reciting bad jokes to each other. I don't just mean the jokes are old or punny or silly. They're legitimately bad jokes. For instance, one character is eating soup loudly. Another asks, \"Is that compulsory?\" and the first replies \"No, it's vegetable.\" They're on that level. It's as if the filmmakers realized they could now use sound to tell jokes and didn't think it mattered HOW they used sound to tell jokes.\n\nThe rest of the short seems to rely on characters acting scared for comedy, which I never think works, and a so-called payoff that consists of people revealing that they weren't actually who they said they were (if they said they were anybody) out of the blue and without much humor.\n\nTalkies from 1929 can be forgiven a certain amount of stiffness and uncertainty stemming from the newness of sound in movies, but that doesn't excuse plain bad comedy writing.",

                "text": "In her day Belle Baker was a top star, a singer of bluesy ballads who was a featured attraction in musical comedies and vaudeville. In 1926 she played the title role in the Broadway show 'Betsy' in which she introduced a song Irving Berlin wrote especially for her, a little ditty called \"Blue Skies.\" Unfortunately, however, Baker belonged to that category of performer who failed to make a successful transition from the stage to the screen. She was short, plump, and not especially photogenic, and already matronly-looking in her mid-30s when talkies arrived. Belle's contemporaries Fanny Brice and Sophie Tucker weren't especially successful in the movies either, but Brice went on to become one of radio's biggest stars while Tucker continued to headline in nightclubs and, eventually, television; meanwhile Baker's career lost momentum in the '30s and gradually petered out.\n\nSong of Love, produced during the first wave of screen musicals in 1929, marked Belle Baker's only starring role in a feature film. She and Ralph Graves play a pair of married vaudevillians, Anna and Tom Gibson, who tour with a singing act that also features their young son Buddy. The central conflict in the story is introduced almost immediately: Anna comes to feel that their son is being deprived of a normal childhood and wants to send him to a regular school, while breezy Tom sees nothing wrong with Buddy growing up in show business. The conflict causes a split in the marriage. Anna buys a house, puts Buddy in school, and launches a solo career at a nightclub, while Tom forms a new partnership, on stage and off, with an attractive young woman named Maisie. Tom continues to travel the vaudeville circuit with his new partner. (Maisie is played by 21 year-old Eve Arden in her movie debut, billed under her real name of Eunice Quedens. Gee, no wonder she became Eve Arden!) Tom starts hitting the bottle and quickly hits the skids, but eventually, a crisis brings him back to his wife and son.\n\nTheatre history buffs will find the backstage scenes of interest, but, sorry to say, the maudlin tone of the story will make Song of Love heavy going for most viewers. It made sense to cast Belle Baker as a mother, given her mom-like appearance, but the script doesn't give her much to work with beyond sentimental platitudes: Anna Gibson is the kind of idealized figure celebrated in the most flowery Mother's Day cards. Happily, there's one sequence that allows Belle to cut loose and demonstrate an unexpected gift for comedy. It arrives when Anna, now a solo performer, has to audition for a nightclub gig. The club is co-owned by two men, one Jewish and the other Italian, and she has to sing for each of them separately. When she sings for Mr. Goldman she assumes a thick Yiddish dialect, but when her listener is Mr. Giuseppe she switches deftly to an Italian accent. (At another point she even throws in a Scottish burr!) This routine gives us a nice little taste of vaudeville and is quite funny, and would have made a good Vitaphone comedy short just by itself. Unfortunately, the bulk of the film lacks this sequence's energy and verve.\n\nOne minor footnote about Song of Love qualifies as something of an inside joke for movie buffs: the supporting role of acrobat Joe Sweeney is played by Arthur Housman, a silent comedy veteran best remembered as Hollywood's perennial comic drunk, staggering his way through dozens of bit roles, most notably with Laurel & Hardy. In this film Housman appears in the backstage scenes looking uncharacteristically clean-cut and clear-eyed, with a running gag of always borrowing the Gibsons' cold cream and never returning it. (It's not much of a gag, but it's all he's got.) Later on, when Tom Gibson hits the skids and is sitting blotto in a saloon, it's Joe Sweeney who tells him he needs to stop drinking and pull himself together.\n\nSo, if you're ever playing the movie edition of Trivial Pursuit, and you're asked to name the film in which perennial drunk Arthur Housman delivers a temperance lecture, remember Song of Love!",

I saw this film at the 2001 Cinecon exhibition and I thought the movie was FUN. Belle Baker was terrific in her \"performance\" pieces and it's a shame she didn't leave more of a legacy as did Fanny Brice, who I think performed in a similar vein. Of course the plot was thin and sappy, but this was true of most early movie musicals (and Broadway ones too). Eve Arden as a 1920's flapper vamp is hilarious, though unintentionally so. Same goes for the young Ralph Graves, Belle's obvious boy-toy, who is always calling her \"Mama.\" One can't really blame him for stepping out with the younger woman who is about a generation younger than \"Mama.\" I also enjoyed the fact that one gets to have a feel for vaudeville show sketches back then through this film, as well as its overall 1920's ambiance. So all in all is it a great film? No. But is it historic and entertaining? I think so.",

I had only known of the singer-comedienne Belle Baker from an article in Joe Franklin's \"Encyclodedia of Comedy\". By the way, Joe Franklin was sitting in front of me in the theater. \"Song of Love\" was an early talkie featuring a comedy player of renown from the stage. However, like early films with Fanny Brice, Joe E. Brown and Al Jolson, the plots of these films were overripe melodramas with the comedy performers showing their stuff during \"performance\" segments. Erle Kenton's direction reeks of the silent film style he had used effectively in the past. There was an attempt to make Baker look as matronly and unattractive as possible. Some of her costumes and shots are absolutely bizarre. Baker's set pieces are entertaining, but it is obvious that Kenton was unsuccessful in getting her to tone down her stage style. There are some interesting aspects of the film. This is the screen debut of Eve Arden, and she plays the vamp who attempts to steal leading man (?) Ralph Graves from Baker. This is definitely not the typical Arden role. Also in the film is young Dave Durrand, who grew up to appear first in Jules White's Glove Slingers series and then became a \"background boy\" in the East Side Kids series. Baker only appeared in two other films, but this is the only one in which she is starred. Although this film may sound intriguing, it should be avoided at all costs. It makes the worst of the Wheeler and Woolsey movies look like \"Citizen Kane\".",

                "text": "I suspect the number of (living) people who have seen this Indian silent picture may have gone up a hundred-fold in the course of the last few hours: London's Trafalgar Square was packed to capacity with what we were told was a 10,000-strong crowd, all present to see a free open-air screening accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra in the premiere of Nitin Sawhney's new score for the film. The turn-out was nothing short of incredible for any silent film, let alone for such an obscurity, and the event was clearly a wild success.\n\nAs for the film itself, it's a highly-coloured epic based on a classic Indian tale, and reminiscent of the works of the brothers Grimm or the stories of Scherezade. There is trickery and romance, rival princes, a wise hermit, a beautiful daughter unfamiliar with the outside world, palaces and jewels, henchmen and loyal followers, kidnapping, disguises and an army on the march. There is even the apocryphal cast of thousands -- with elephants! The new score is well done, and is in a sufficiently 'Western' style to be accessible to a European audience while containing an Indian flavour in the solo voices and instruments: the LSO performance was admirable, and was in fact the best live orchestral synchronisation I've yet heard. The actors are both good-looking (where appropriate) and talented, and there is some impressive wildlife footage at the beginning and sophisticated editing at the end.\n\nWhat I didn't get, to be honest, was any sense of emotional depth: this is a simplistic moral or fairy-tale style story with a great deal of plot and little space for characterisation. It's all on the surface, and a very attractive surface it is too; but that's all there is. The film is entertaining and technically excellent, with lavish production values thrown into the bargain. It never got me involved on any more intense level, though.",

Sohan's plot fails though and Ranjit is only wounded during his hunting \"accident\" and is saved by a local healer. While staying in this village, Ranjit meets the beautiful Sunita and decides to make her his wife. Her father refuses due to Ranjit's famed gambling habit but when Sohan gets wind of the lovers' planned elopement, he comes up with another evil plot.\n\nUnlike the consistently thorough IMDb reviewer \"Igenlode Wordsmith\", I was not fortunate enough to see the BFI dust this film off in Trafalgar Square with a live orchestra earlier this year. Instead I had to catch it on channel 4 (screened at an absurdly late hour) but the reason for the showing was the same \u0096 the re-scoring of the original film by composer Nitin Sawhney. I don't mean to ignore this aspect of the film but I also don't want to fixate on it and ignore the film as a whole. Before watching it, it is important to accept that this is a silent film from India almost eighty years old, and perhaps put aside your modern eyes to some degree \u0096 complaining about a lack of dialogue may say more about the reviewer than the film! However you should expect the standards of the silent era and of a film this age and not be complaining because the film is actually an impressive piece of silent cinema. The story is a strong story of love, betrayal and murder. When you can describe characters as \"evil king\" and \"bad king\" you won't be surprised to learn that this is not the most subtle of character films but this approach suits the medium as one does need to overstate things when doing it without the benefit of sound. I was held by it for the 80-odd minute running time \u0096 itself an impressive fact considering it was made in the twenties.\n\nContinuing the theme of scale, IMDb's trivia footnote tells me this film had 10,000 extras, 1000 horses and 50 elephants \u0096 I wouldn't have guessed those figures but there is no doubt that the film is impressive in regards the scale of the production. The sets and shots are impressive in their sheer size; this is not a film shot on cheap sets but one that wears the majesty of its characters in all the detail. Osten directs very well, managing these shots but also bringing off intimate character moments as well as some technically clever stuff as well (the reflection in the water shot was my favourite). He also brings the best out of his cast \u0096 although again you need to appreciate that this is a silent film and that the acting style demanded is different. Roy is the hero of the piece and he performs this task well, even if he is a tad dull with it. Likewise Devi makes for a very attractive heroine who works her chemistry with the hero as well as she does her lack of chemistry with the villain, however it is Rai's film to be had. He play the villain and he gets to do so with a wonderfully melodramatic performance that plays up so the audience can see he is being sneaky, plotting etc. In a modern film we would call him cheesy but here it is just what was required and his performance is a delight, adding energy to the film.\n\nFinally, given that it is the reason for the recent showing, it would be impolite not to mention Sawhney's score \u0096 indeed it would be foolish because it is excellent. It manages to be modern and old fashioned at the same time but most importantly, it perfectly matches the tone of the film as it plays. This means that the drama is lifted, the humour is played out a little and the involvement and attitude of the audience is guided by the music \u0096 and I cannot think of what more I would want from a score. Will I be putting it on my pod for casual listening? Well no, but within the film it is perfect and I am jealous of the people who saw it with London Symphony Orchestra in the open air.\n\nOverall then a quite impressive silent film in terms of scale and delivery, the addition of a great new score only serves to make it better.",

Clearly, the recent restoration was a smashing success--as was the nice musical score. As a result, the film is well worth seeing--though I must admit that the story did seem to have some problems as it was a bit silly and hard to believe. After all, who is THAT stupid?! The story is about two cousins--each who is a king in an Indian kingdom. One is evil but hides it very well--and he intends to destroy his cousin and take his kingdom. First, an arrow is deliberately shot into the unsuspecting king during a hunting trip, but he manages to survive--and fall in love with the local doctor's daughter. Next, the doctor is murdered and the good king is framed...but that plot, too, in undone when the man hired to do the killing admits his deed as he himself dies. So, the wicked king decides to cheat the cousin out of his kingdom as well as his new fianc\u00e9 through the use of loaded dice. How all this is resolved is for you to see when you watch the film.\n\nAs for the third plot to steal the kingdom, it's all very difficult to believe--especially that anyone would be stupid enough to fall for the evil king's plan to get his cousin to gamble away his kingdom. It all has a mythical quality about it and I assume this is probably taken from some ancient Indian folk tale. But, despite this being the weak point in the film, the rest of the movie is so lovely that I think the plot can be overlooked a bit.

The story begins in the Indian jungle, where pretty Seta Devi (as Sunita) has been secreted by a hermitic father.\n\nYou will immediately see that hiding the fetchingly-attired Ms. Devi from society isn't going to last because the area also serves as tiger hunting grounds for two ruling cousins - \"Good King\" Charu Roy (as Ranjit) and \"Bad King\" Himansu Rai (as Sohat).\n\nIn the opening hunt, the latter shoots the former \"accidentally on purpose\" with an arrow. The former unexpectedly recovers, due to the tender loving care provided by Devi. So, if he is to steal nubile young woman from Mr. Roy, Mr. Rai must take more drastic measures, which he does.

I was really shocked to see how marvelous this film looked as it appears each shot took hours to make sure everything was correct so that they could get all the details on the frame. Another major plus is the wildlife scenes at the start of the movie as we get to see various creatures in their habitat. The costume design is also marvelous and it really makes you seem as if you're right in India during the particular time that this film takes place. Yet another major plus are the locations. You can't help but look at this film with your eyes wide open as the locations just jump off the screen and that beautiful black and white print is really, really sharp. Every single frame of this film is beautiful to look at but sadly the story is really lacking.

Another problem I had is that I didn't care for either cousin so it was hard to root against the bad one and cheer for the good one.

This film is really easy to follow and I liked the writing and acting here. Seeta Devi is gorgeous. Shame she did not manage to get a career in sound film.

Title cards appear to tell us where the numbers USED to be. Even the audio is gone.\n\nIndeed we miss Bessie Love leading a chorus in \"Everybody Tap,\" Charles King singing \"Love Ain't Nothing' but the Blues.\" and Marie Dressler singing \"My Dynamic Personality.\" Also the entire finale of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" is also gone. Thanks to Richard Barrios for listing the missing songs in a footnote in A SONG IN THE DARK.\n\nThe few numbers that are left aren't too great. King sings \"Lucky Me and Lovable You\" to Love (who does not sing). But they do a short dance number. Dressler does an early number on the train, and Nina Martan (odd spelling) also sings one song.\n\nIn this backstage musical about an acting company traveling across country in a show called \"Goodbye Broadway,\" we get the usual stories about jealousy, love, etc. Love is adorable as Carlie, King is better than he was in THE Broadway MELODY, Benny is funny, and of course Dressler and Moran steal every scene they're in. George K. Arthur has a small role as a (gay?) member of the troupe, and so does Gwen Lee as the member who quits early on, requiring them to hire Martan. Eddie Phillips plays the smarmy lover.\n\nAfter smash hits with THE Broadway MELODY and Hollywood REVUE OF 1929, MGM launched this musical with its A Cast, but by the time the film hit theaters, the craze for musicals was winding down. Revue films were so unpopular that MGM included \"Not a Revue\" in its advertising for CHASING RAINBOWS. Bessie Love was MGM's #1 musical star of the time, and Marie Dressler and Polly Moran are just plain hysterically funny together.\n\nLet's hope these Technicolor musical numbers are found some day. What a treat that would be!",

Although the film features a song that would become a classic ('Happy Days Are Here Again' by Milton Ager & Jack Yellen) it is on the strength of a\ncouple of its performances that its modest success is based.\n\nPert & pretty Bessie Love is wonderful as a sweet young singer who adores her leading man. She is completely natural with the microphone and exhibits a tender talent which was never allowed to grow to its full potential in talking films. While good throughout, the scene in which she dissolves into hysterical laughter upon hearing some emotionally devastating news is absolutely frightening in its power.\n\nAs her love interest, Charles King doesn't fare nearly so well. This is largely due to the fact that his romantic trials &\ntribulations - involving women other than Miss Love - are of no interest whatsoever and his reaction to them show his character to be both shallow & immature, critical character flaws in a film's hero. King was among MGM's very first musical stars, but his movie career would be very brief, lasting only from 1928 to 1930, for a total of six films.\n\nPlaying the stage manager, Jack Benny is the emotional calm point around which the activity swirls. He has very little to do besides move the plot along. His brotherly interest in Miss Love seems platonic and Jack is left out of the film's romantic action.\n\n\nWhile not given top billing, Canadian Marie Dressler steals the film as an aging comedienne with too much past. Using her large, homely face & shapeless body to great advantage, she grabs the viewers' attention and never lets go. At this point in her career Dressler was right on the cusp of gaining enormous personal success and within a year she would become Hollywood's biggest star. Even in such a relatively routine role, such as she fills here, Dressler reveals the tremendous heart &\ncommon touch which would be the secret to her celebrity. (For an extra chuckle, pay close attention during the opening long shot where the cast sings the last few bars of 'Happy Days' -\njust to the right of center screen is the Marvelous Marie, swaying across the stage with elephantine grace.)\n\nAppearing as a drunken wardrobe lady, the ubiquitous Polly Moran makes another appearance as Dressler's sidekick. Short, spunky & buxom, Polly was always fun to watch - but never more so than when teamed with Marie.\n\nIn a small role, George K. Arthur plays Benny's gynandrous assistant; an important silent comedy star for MGM, this Scottish-born actor would soon sink into talkie anonymity.\n\nIt should be noted that the film's original Technicolor sequences - including several songs and the entire conclusion -\nare now completely missing.",

                "text": "\"Chasing Rainbows\" (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1929-30), directed by Charles F. Reisner, was the studio's attempt in duplicating the success of its very first all sound musical titled \"The Broadway Melody\" (1929), that won the Academy Award as Best Picture. To review \"Chasing Rainbows,\" one cannot help but compare this to \"The Broadway Melody,\" a backstage story revolving around a sister act (Bessie Love and Anita Page) that nearly breaks up on account of their love for the same leading man (Charles King). Aside from the re-teaming of Love and King, this new edition, set in small town theaters during a road show tour instead of the Broadway theater district, substitutes troublesome leading ladies over kid sisters to complicate matters. Love, whose climatic crying scene from \"The Broadway Melody\" that earned her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress, attempts doing same thing here with her moment of hysterics, this time with laughter. As much as the situations are basically the same, the results aren't. Although the film's title might indicate an old favorite of \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" as one of its highlight production numbers, it actually began production as \"Road Show\" a title more appealing to the plot at hand.\n\nFollowing the opening title credits over the visual of a passing train, and minus any underscoring, the plot gets underway with the closing of the road show performance of \"Good-bye Broadway\" where the cast gathers together in the big finale. Eddie Brock (Jack Benny), the stage manager, gets the company ready for their next engagement in another town. Terry Fay (Charles King), the leading man, is blind by the true love of Carlie Seymour (Bessie Love), his partner of five years. Upset over Peggy (Gwen Lee) quitting the show and leaving with another man, Terry threatens suicide until Brock acquires Daphne Wayne (Nita Martan) as the show's new leading lady. Terry falls for Daphne, who, in reality, is using him for her own professional gain. After Carlie discovers Daphne carrying on an affair with Don Cordova (Eddie Phillips), her former leading man, she tries to warn Terry, who refuses to listen. Even after he realizes Carlie accusations are correct, Terry, still blinded by Daphne's presence, marries her, complicating matters all around.\n\nFor the motion picture soundtrack, songs (*indicating two-strip Technicolor sequences) include: \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" (sung by chorus); \"Pure But Honest\" (sung by Marie Dressler); \"Lucky Me and Lovable You\" (sung by Charles King); \"Do I Know What I'm Doing?\" (sung by Nita Martan, reprized by Marie Dressler and Polly Moran); *\"Everybody Tap\" (performed by Bessie Love); *\"Love Ain't Nothing But the Blues\" (sung by Charles King); \"Lucky Me and Lovable You\" (reprised by Charles King); *\"My Dynamic Personality\" (sung by Marie Dressler) and *\"Happy Days Are Here Again\" (sung by chorus). Considering its bright score, only \"Happy Days Are Here Again,\" twice performed briefly, remains relatively known to this day. \"Lucky Me and Lovable You,\" the film's best song, used for underscoring during the tender moments between King and Love, did not recapture the similar mood and qualities of \"You Were Meant For Me\" that was introduced in \"The Broadway Melody.\" While \"Chasing Rainbows\" improves technically over its primitive production style of \"The Broadway Melody,\" which simply lacked the brighter moments supplied by Marie Dressler and Polly Moran in their usual feuding pal roles. Dressler, shortly before achieving super stardom following her Academy Award winning performance in \"Min and Bill\" (1930), not only gets a chance to sing, but shares a drunken scene with Moran, cast here as the wardrobe woman. Fans of Jack Benny's radio and TV show can get an early glimpse of the popular comedian before reaching 39 playing a straight man providing some funny one-liners here and there.\n\nOf all the musicals produced during the early sound period, \"Chasing Rainbows\" is truly a forgotten one. Due to the missing two-strip Technicolor musical sequences, shortening its original length from 100 minutes to 86, \"Chasing Rainbows\" has never been televised, at least until the era of Turner Classic Movies following its 1984 premiere where this musical became part as its very own film preservation series where still photos for the missing sequences were inserted with sub-titles indicating its actions filling in the void. With that said, \"Chasing Rainbows,\" in spite of Charlie King's occasional annoying character portrayal, proves not only one of the more worthier rediscoveries of the early sound era, but a good companion piece to the much better known \"Broadway Melody.\" (** curtain calls)",

                "text": "I really love this film - that is, what is left of it. What remains is roughly the 85 minutes which comprise the dramatic portion. What is missing are the Technicolor numbers, or approximately 20 minutes. TCM has inserted publicity stills with title cards telling the audience of any plot developments that happen during the missing scenes, and all in all it is quite watchable in its current state.\n\nThis movie reunites Bessie Love and Charles King from \"Broadway Melody\" fame of the year before, and throws in Jack Benny, Polly Moran, and Marie Dressler of \"The Hollywood Revue\", also from 1929. Many people describe this film as a redo of the Broadway Melody formula, but it really is quite different from that. The film follows the troupe of the show \"Goodbye Broadway\" as it moves from town to town during one theatrical season. Here Charles King plays vaudevillian Terry Fay who is oblivious to the fact that his partner, Carlie, (Bessie Love) is in love with him. Terry makes a play for every leading lady on the vaudeville circuit. Of course they use him, of course they break his heart, and of course he goes right out and does it again. However, he finally meets his match in Daphne Wayne (Nita Martin) who sees in Terry a way to make it to Broadway and off the road show circuit. \n\nPlotwise, it isn't much, but plot really isn't the point of these early talkie back-stagers. Bessie Love comes across wonderfully as the taken-for-granted partner. You can really feel the emotional roller-coaster she is on as she thinks she may have finally gotten to Terry only to find out he's thrown her over once again. Jack Benny is great as the wise-cracking stage manager. MGM has thankfully dropped the lechery angle that he had in Hollywood Revue and instead has him adding in his biting sarcastic wit here and there, showing us a taste of what will make him a success in radio. Polly Moran and Marie Dressler are hilarious as two aging ladies of the vaudeville scene, long-time friends who are constantly at each other's throats.\n\nThe whole group plays together with such chemistry, yet Jack Benny himself always kidded about how this film landed with a thud when it opened in 1930, calling it \"Chasing Customers\". If you like any of the stars I've mentioned and the early talkie musicals, this one is worth watching and even has a few songs in it. If it had been released a year earlier it would probably have been a major hit and be intact today. Had it been made a year later - well, it wouldn't have been made at all a year later because by 1931 nobody was making musical films anymore. This is really worth seeking out, just don't be surprised by the condition the sound and video are in. The film really looks shaggy compared to how well the other early MGMs have been preserved.",

Sadly, this great old song is presented only in fragmentary form at the beginning to set the tone for a story about a traveling theatrical troupe; later, when the time comes for a full- length version, we learn from an insert that the sequence has been lost, a blow which this backstager cannot survive. (Imagine Golddiggers of 1935 without \"Lullabye of Broadway.) There is a decent Ager-Yellen ballad (\"Lucky Me, Lovable You,\" crooned impeccably by Charles King) and a couple of comedy numbers put over with gusto by the scenery-chewing Marie Dressler. The plot (girl-loves-boy-who-loves-other-girls) moves too slowly and far too much time is spent on Dressler's vaudevillian comic routines with her frequent screen partner Polly Moran. The two were real crowd pleasers back in the day, which only shows how much tastes have changed. Their shtick is occasionally funny but not funny enough to justify twenty minutes of footage. Jack Benny is very good as the level-headed stage manager who holds the troupe together and Charles King acts almost as well as he sings. The delicate Bessie Love has a strange, extended scene in which she breaks into grimacing, demented laughter which veers into crying and then back into laughter.",

He rattles off many of his one-liners as Eddie, part of the big traveling (and unraveling) road show. He should know, after all those years of vaudeville, before getting his own radio and TV shows. This movie is all about taking the show on the road, and Bonnie's (Marie Dressler) facial expressions as she gets elbowed, steam-blasted by the train, and insulted by the rest of the cast. Dressler was showing her age here (sixty something, with pretty big bags under her eyes) but that didn't slow her down any. She made SEVEN films in 1930, and only made a couple more before passing away in 1934. Two of her last ones were biggies, Tugboat Annie, and Dinner at Eight! Co-stars Bessie Love (Carlie) and Polly Moran (Polly) had also started in the silents and continued on with the talkies. Lots of backstage jokes and chiding each other, mostly by Eddie and Polly. Also an on again, off again love story between Carlie and Terry (Charles King, who only made a few films). Some serious, touching moments between the girls as they talk over their intentions regarding the men-folk. Sad to note that the color song and dance portions are missing in action - hopefully someday they will be found. Directed by Charles Reisner, who had worked his way up through every occupation, starting with the silents. Written by Robert Hopkins, who would be nominated for an Oscar for his writing on San Francisco (1936). Good story, no plot holes, very family friendly. I really enjoyed watching this one.... it wasn't as hokey as a lot of those \"back-stage, behind the scenes stories\" were back then. Good to see J. Benny in an early role.",

That's because the Two-Color Technicolor portions of the film are missing and Turner Classic Movies substituted stills for the missing scenes! It's a crude way to try to reassemble the film--far from ideal, that's for sure.\n\n\"Chasing Rainbows\" is a musical featuring Bessie Love and Charles King (who'd just starred together in the Oscar winning \"Broadway Melody\"). In addition to being a musical, Jack Benny (in one of his first films) as well as Polly Moran and Marie Dressler (both of which made a short series of comedies together following this film) are on hand to provide some comedy. Those familiar with Benny's 1940s-50s persona might have a hard time recognizing him, as here he is nothing like his radio and TV self. I'd seen him in a couple early shorts, so seeing him as a fast-talking sort of guy didn't surprise me.\n\nThe film finds Benny the leader of a touring Broadway-style review. Although Love and King are good friends, you have a strong impression that they are destined to be much more. But, in the meantime, dumb 'ol King's head is turned by a new leading lady (Nita Martan). You just KNOW that Nita is 100% bad and Bessie is a sweetheart, but it sure takes King a long time to recognize this. In fact, he is a bit too stupid to be real! In the meantime, there are lots of song and dance numbers, comedic interludes (which aren't all that funny) and various backstage vignettes. In fact, the plot isn't always all that important--it's more an excuse to feature the other acts.\n\nAs I said above, it's very hard to score this movie. It is rather old fashioned and derivative (an awful lot like \"Broadway Melody\") but good for 1929/1930. But the fact that it's missing so much of the film make it great viewing for total film nuts (like me) but not so great for everyone else. As I LOVE films from this era and don't mind the very dated style, I could highly recommend it to people like me....all six of us! By the way, this film was apparently made in 1929 and not released until 1930. Believe it or not, this is actually pretty easy to tell as sound technology improved quickly during the late 20s-early 30s and the film looks and sounds more like a 1929 production.\n\nBy the way, if you DO see this film, get a load of Bessie's laughing sequence--she sounds positively demented! It's easy to see it's an early talkie, as later directors never would have done the scene that way.",

It had strengths, but it also had flaws. In fact, three of each.\n\nThe three strengths were Jack Benny, Marie Dressler, and Bessie Love. I've always been a Jack Benny fan, and he does not disappoint here. His sharp, fast one-liners are a funny and very welcome part of the movie. This was my first introduction to Marie Dressler, and I'm an instant fan; she was just marvelous. Probably the best part of the movie. And finally, I loved Bessie Love's work here. The Carlie character she brings to life is sweet and sincere and adorable, and you quickly find yourself pulling for her. I would've gone for Carlie in an instant.\n\nAs for the flaws, the biggest is Charles King's Terry Fay. I can't even assess Kings performance, because the character itself, as written, is just so horrible. He's a romantic lummox and comes across as both moron and jerk. By the time we learn that he's married Daphne, I completely hated him and didn't *want* Carlie to end up with him; she was just too good for him and deserved much better. That's a pretty big flaw in a romance.\n\nThe other two flaws were more minor, and one of them wasn't the film's fault. First, I found the romantic resolution to be lame. After all the romantic vacillations and tribulations, we were entitled to more of a payoff at the climax. The long-awaited final get- together is just so rushed and skipped-over, its like the film makers themselves really didn't care. But part of the problem may be related to the second flaw: the fact that the film is missing a number of scenes. As others have already pointed out, there are a number of scenes which were filmed in early 2-color Technicolor (whatever exactly that is), which are missing. From the descriptions that the cobbled together available version provides, it seems like they were just set-piece stage numbers. But that includes the *entire* ending of the film. Maybe somewhere within all that missing stuff, more was developed to support the final get-together of the two leads. Even if it were all just wordless, looks and expressions and whatever. Maybe that's part of why the resolution feels so thin and rushed.\n\nRegardless, I would pay a lot to see the film restored to its original form. If for no other reason than to get to see one more number with Marie Dressler!",

                "text": "This spectacular but ill-fated film was MGMs entry into the SF/Fantasy mini-boom of the 1920s. Attempting to cash in on the success of blockbusters such as The Lost World (1925) and The Thief of Bagdad (1924) Louis B. Mayer ordered a script fashioned which would be an amalgam of several Verne novels, with plot elements borrowed from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Master of the World, Michael Strogoff, along with the title book itself. As if to signal their hopes for the film to the world, the producers hired Lloyd Hughes, bright-eyed leading man from The Lost World, to play their hero and also retained the services of cameraman J. Ernest Williamson, who had photographed the groundbreaking underwater scenes featured in the 1916 version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The production was an exceptionally troubled one. The Mysterious Island was three years in the making, delayed and delayed, once by a hurricane that completely destroyed Williamson's underwater film laboratory. The decision to make the film in Technicolor (the original two-strip process introduced earlier in 1926 with Fairbanks's Black Pirate) was impeding progress as well. Then, just as the silent version of the film was approaching completion, the Talkie revolution swept the industry. This sent the filmmakers back to the drawing board yet again, where they reconceived the movie as a predominantly silent picture with several lengthy sound sequences. This decision not only necessitated a great deal of re-shooting, but also the replacement of Warner Oland (originally cast as the heavy of the piece, Baron Falon) with character actor Montagu Love. By the time The Mysterious Island was ready to show publicly it had cost the studio over 4 million dollars, an astronomical sum by the standards of the day. It was far and away MGMs most expensive project to date;and the future of science fiction in film was riding on its success. Those who did see The Mysterious Island during its original release certainly got an eyeful. Reclusive Count Dakkar (Captain Nemo's real name, by the way, as revealed by Verne in the 20,000 Leagues sequel) uses a spectacular volcanic island near the Baltic kingdom of Hetvia as home base for his scientific experiments. There he constructs two futuristic submarines with which he intends to investigate his theory of a mysterious race of half-human fish men living at the bottom of the sea. Just as the first of these submarines sets out on its sea-trials, however, Dakkar's old friend Falon betrays him, overruns his island with soldiers, and takes the Count and his sister Sonia hostage. Using them as bait, Falon lures the first submarine, captained by Dakkar's chief engineer Nicolai Roget, back into port and sinks it with cannonballs. As it descends uncontrollably into the depths, the triumphant Falon boards the second boat, which will now become an undreamed-of weapon of destruction in his ruthless and ambitious hands. The Baron hasn't reckoned on the determination of Sonia, however, who is willing to sink the second sub as well, with herself and Falon on board, rather than see her brother's work used for world domination. As Submarine #2 follows the other into the hopeless abyssal depths, The Mysterious Island begins to unleash its impressive array of special effects. Though undoubtedly crude by today's standards, these effects (similar to those seen in Thief of Bagdad) are nonetheless wonderfully imaginative, having something of the appeal of an elaborate puppet show. And the rigid diving suits the aquanauts use during the finale are worthy of mention also; somehow fanciful and yet believable at the same time, they're still impressive today. I think the drama in The Mysterious Island works well, too. Lionel Barrymore's transformation from idealistic, would-be benefactor of humanity into embittered vigilante is quite effective, and the torture scene that brings about this transformation is wrenching. Much has been made of the film's lack of fidelity to the original book;too much, in fact. What the filmmakers seem to have envisioned was an epitome of Verne, an attempt to capture the essence of the Vernian world rather than a literal adaptation of any one book. This being the case, I think it's interesting just how many of the author's themes did make it into The Mysterious Island. In fact, if you stopped the film just before the end it would work as an interesting prequel to Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The traumatic events that ignited Captain Nemo's anti-war crusade, merely alluded to in the Disney version, are vividly depicted here. At any rate, The Mysterious Island was, as you may have guessed by now, an abject failure at the box-office. For reasons that aren't quite clear, audiences of 1929 stayed away in droves and the film recouped less than ten per cent of its negative cost. The impact of this calamity, both on MGM and on the rest of Hollywood, would be difficult to overstate. The Mysterious Island disaster not only frightened producers away from Jules Verne, it cast a stink of failure over the entire concept of science-fiction cinema, a stink that clung to it for nearly 25 years. On the rare occasions when a sci-fi theme or concept did make it to the screen during the Thirties or Forties it was as part of a horror movie or in a cheap serial made for children. The Mysterious Island, in other words, managed to nip the whole burgeoning genre in the bud. The film itself was forgotten by MGM and nearly lost, perhaps on purpose. Even today, it can only be seen in black and white; no Technicolor print is known to exist.",

One such important but still entertaining early films is THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. It was intended as a silent film, but with the success of \"talkies\", the studio decided to add dialog and very loud sound effects to this very early sci-fi film taken from the Jules Verne novel. At times, the sound works very well--such as in the beginning when there is a lot of dialog (provided the record of the sounds was timed perfectly--fortunately on video and DVD this isn't a problem). At other times, it looks like a silent movie with a few tacked on sounds (similar to what happened with Harold Lloyd's WELCOME DANGER). However, despite this \"hybrid\" nature of the film, it is still very entertaining--and a lot of fun to see sci-fi done in the old fashioned way. The undersea sequences are of course dated, but not really that bad for 1929--in fact, I found them to be pretty charming.

                "text": "I truly enjoyed 'The Mysterious Island', even though this film is a mess. It's also the most definitive example (by which I mean the WORST example) of that mongrel genre which haunted Hollywood in the last three years of the 1920s: the part-talkie. Long stretches of 'Mysterious Island' are completely silent: other sections combine sound effects with the actors' dialogue on title cards, while a few sequences are all-sound and all-noisy. The fact that three different directors worked on this movie is another reason why it's a pile of hash ... but it's very enjoyable hash. It's also a splendid example of the science-fiction subgenre known as 'steampunk'.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILERS COMING. Supposedly this 'Mysterious Island' is a film version of Jules Verne's novel, but the only story elements surviving the transition are an island, a submarine, and an embittered patrician who's also a scientific genius. Count Dakkar (Lionel Barrymore, more restrained than usual) is building his super-secret subs on an island off the coast of some Graustarkian nation. Meanwhile, he knows there's a race of weird aquatic creatures living on the ocean floor nearby. He knows this because at regular intervals another bone washes up on his island ... and Barrymore is putting these bones together, one at a time, to form a skeleton. I found this extremely contrived: how convenient that all the bones are in proportion (rather than some being adult specimens and others from children) and none of them are redundant (he doesn't find two right femurs, for instance). Each new piece of jetsam conveniently and neatly fits the specimen-in-progress. Still, it's eerie to see a weird inhuman anatomy slowly taking shape as Barrymore adds one more bone to the jigsaw skeleton.\n\nCount Dakkar's rival is Baron Falon, who is probably annoyed at Dakkar because counts outrank barons. The pair of them (plus the romantic leads and some miscellaneous henchlings) end up in two super-subs on the ocean floor, which is inhabited by these weird little duckbilled aqua-men who look like upright platypuses. There's some splendid photography by Percy Hilburn, simulating the ocean floor. Far away, we see one tiny creature walking towards the camera. When he gets closer, he looks like dwarf actor Angelo Rossitto in a Donald Duck costume ... but the image on screen is still oddly compelling. Later, the aqua-men turn up in droves: some walking, others swimming. It turns out they like to drink human blood ... but how often do they get any? When Baron Falon's diving-helmet shatters, all the little platypuses start licking his blood. An astonishing scene.\n\nThere's some rather bad scene continuity. Jacqueline Gadsden (very pretty, but no actress) spends all her early scenes wearing an elaborate crinoline hoop-skirt. She even wears this thing when she gets aboard Barrymore's submarine. (How did she get it through the hatch?) Then, all at once, she's inside a deep-sea diving-suit. Did she cram the entire hoop-skirt and all those petticoats into the diving rig? We find out later that she'd changed into a boiler suit, which she's wearing inside the diving outfit ... but this should have been established in a transition shot.\n\nThe directors of part-talkies were usually careful to select WHICH scenes would use recorded dialogue. In 'Mysterious Island', the talkie sequences are quite arbitrary. Gadsden, as Countess Sonia, speaks all her dialogue in the form of silent-film intertitles. Late in the film, she's captured by Baron Falon, who conspires to mislead handsome idiot Nikolai (Lloyd Hughes) by enlisting a henchwoman to imitate Sonia's voice over a crude audio system. The camera shows Hughes reacting while a woman's voice (supposedly Countess Sonia's) emerges from a nearby loudspeaker. As we've never actually heard the real Sonia's voice in any previous scenes, we've no way of judging if the henchwoman's vocal impersonation is accurate.\n\nIn spite of its many faults (including a patchwork script), this movie is extremely enjoyable. I'll rate 'Mysterious Island' 7 out of 10. Those duck-men are amazing!",

Then again, the plot itself (which probably has little to do with Jules Verne's original) isn't exactly inspired: the Russian-style setting is a mistake and the love triangle/class struggle element really bogs down the proceedings.\n\nWhat makes the film, therefore, are the submarine/underwater sequences \u0096 even if the monster attacks themselves are somewhat lame (featuring nothing more imaginative than an alligator made-up to look like a dinosaur[!] and a rather small octopus).

There's an odd, anachronistic flavor to the mythical mid-19th century Slavic setting, peopled by characters named Sonia, Nikolai, Dmitri et al. It's as if the technology of the future (circa 1930) was superimposed over the ideas of the past, with dialogue and action set to the romanticized movie standards of Jazz Age Hollywood.

Though the grafting is rather evident it doesn't take away from the film itself and the enjoyment thereof.\n\nThis could easily have been a disaster for MGM. In their first two years the production costs of Ben-Hur and The Big Parade had the top brass worried. Fortunately both proved to be box office smashes and insured the survival of the studio. The Mysterious Island had that kind of ambition behind it and didn't do as well as those two classics, but by that time MGM's survival was guaranteed.\n\nApparently just as they were about to release it, sound was gaining more popularity and it was decided to add some dialog and sound effects. In a book about the Barrymore family Louis B. Mayer thanked whatever Gods he worshiped that the hero and villain of his film, Lionel Barrymore and Montagu Love were both theatrically trained players with marvelous speaking voices.\n\nIn fact one of the great things about the film is that the longest sequence with dialog is right at the beginning and it's between Barrymore and Love and it sets the stage for the whole film. In 1929 just about every film had overacting in it as players were getting used to sound. But there's not a trace of it in this sequence as both of these veterans by instinct knew how to handle the microphone.\n\nMGM had a lot of shooting problems getting the special effects right, but for their time what came out was pretty darn good.\n\nWhat they didn't do is use any part of Jules Verne's book other than the title. Barrymore is both a member of the nobility and a scientist who lives and works on his own island off the coast of some Balkan country. His island is a dead volcano the peasants all work for Barrymore in his experiments, but hardly in the same way they did for Dracula or Frankenstein. Montagu Love is another noble who has ambitions to take over the kingdom and would love to get his hands on the prototype deep sea submarine that Barrymore is constructing. He does of course and Barrymore gives chase down to the depths where they encounter a host of underwater marvels including giant sea creatures and a race of men who've developed just as man has in the deep ocean.\n\nThis early attempt at science fiction is a landmark film and deserves to be recognized as such. Though Jules Verne wouldn't have recognized his story, the film is still a good one and even the obvious grafting of sound and dialog on the film doesn't hamper it's entertainment value in the least.",

There is an island, but it's off the coast of \"Hetvia,\" the kind of make-believe kingdom in which quaint old operettas take place, plus elements of Czarist Russia but with the look of Southern California. A title card informs us that the people are \"oppressed\"; we then learn that a sort of palace revolution is being prepared by the wicked Baron Falon (Montagu Love), who includes in his power strategy a scheme to seize the island from its resident Count (Lionel Barrymore), an eccentric scientist who has developed a ship that can sail underwater (these were the days when the word \"submarine\" had yet to become common) to explore the depths of the sea where he believes there is a race of human-like creatures that have evolved parallel to terrestrial homo sapiens; in fact, he has been collecting and assembling their bleached bones for years as they wash up onto the shore. \n\nThe Baron finds all of this amusing enough but is most intrigued by the vessel's war-making potential, a usage which the peace-loving Count opposes. Thrown into the mix is the Count's beautiful sister (Jane Daly, who resembles the later and much better known Merle Oberon), dressed and coiffed like a 19th century lady of the manor but perfectly at home in her brother's milieu of hardware and gadgets, and well versed in the nuts and bolts of his scientific enterprises. She is in love with Nikolai (Lloyd Hughes), one of the Count's assistants, much to the displeasure of the Baron who covets her for himself.\n\nWhile Nikolai is out to sea in a test run of the submarine, the Baron's forces occupy the island and try to torture the Count and his sister into revealing their scientific secrets. They heroically resist. When the submarine resurfaces and encounters gunfire, the crew realizes what's going on and re-submerges so that a small party in underwater suits can sneak into the castle via underground passageways that link to the ocean and rescue the prisoners. They do so, but are pursued underwater by a second, identical submarine that has been commandeered by the wicked Baron.\n\nAt the bottom of the sea the adversaries encounter the race of semi-humans who look like black-and-white versions of the proverbial little green men of science fiction. They are photographed through a wavy distorting lens that gives the impression of underwater movement as they hop around the sea floor making swimming motions with their finned arms and swarm around the ships in the manner of the Lilliputians of \"Gulliver's Travels.\" The ships themselves look like bathtub replicas of tuna fish with little propellers on one end. Crawling around on the sea floor is a large reptile that looks like a cross between a beetle and a stegosaurus. And later we are introduced to an octopus that is laboriously combined with shots of the humanoids either fleeing or pursuing it. At one point the tentacles of the octopus reach into one of the submarines and wrap around Lionel Barrymore in a scene so poorly staged that it could well have come from Ed Wood's \"Bride of the Monster\" with Bela Lugosi. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor features the kind of radio era mechanical devices one might find in Universal's \"Frankenstein\" lab or the factory in \"Metropolis\" next to clocks with Roman numerals, next to electric lights flashing on control panels; also toy miniatures of boats in a water tank that look exactly like toys in a water tank, and unconvincing painted backdrops standing in for actual mountains and cities.\n\nNothing of the above is very interesting in itself. But the juxtaposition of elements of the 19th and 20th centuries gives this film a meta-content that it never had in its own time and never knew it could have. We are looking at the baby steps of what would become a full-blown motion picture genre--the science fiction epic adventure with social commentary thrown in, but in this case adding nothing but more footage to increase the running time. We are also straddling two cinematic eras: silent and talkie. So at certain moments dialogue suddenly becomes audible. In the longest talking scene Barrymore gets very hammy, even for him, constantly running his hands through his hair and over his face as he speaks.",

I think it was the first time I had seen him without white hair! What struck me was that the usually stellar Barrymore was giving a really bad, hammy performance. In this one long sequence where he's explaining that he believes there are these man-like sea creatures, he rarely looked the other actor in the eye, he kept putting his hand on his chin and rubbing his face. The camera, most likely due to the lack of technology, was very static. No camera movement at all - just cuts. It's a hoot to watch such a youngish Lionel (although he was already 51 at the time) and it is also interesting to note his stronger resemblance to his brother in this movie (more so in this movie than in later films.) During this time of transition, many films were basically silent films with some talking scenes, as studios found it difficult to wholly embrace this new technology. Even the well-known movie, The Jazz Singer, was not an all-talking movie. It is, however, the first feature length movie to have talking in it. On July 6, 1928, the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, premiered. Our movie is made in 1929, which was at the end of the silent era.\n\nIf you want to know more about early talkies, check out this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film",

In this early and mostly Silent, Black and White film, Barrymore plays a futurist scientist who builds a Undersea craft with which he plans to visit the incredible city of the Undersea people. Jacqueline Gadsden plays his daughter, Countess Sonia Dakkar (Jane Daly) and Nikolai Roget (Lloyd Hughes) her intended. However, the heavy, Baron Hubert Falcon (Montagu Love) has his own plans for her, but needs to capture the strange craft for world conquest. Despite the film being poorly cut and the primitive 'talkie' is plagued with many 'silent' segments, the story is easily carried by the cast. Further, if an audience is Patience and not overly critical, the viewing is enjoyable. Seeing this movie in the light of it being an early entry in the world of films, one can understand why it became a Classic in 1929. ****",

He and his workmen are building two submarines with which he will explore the ocean depths for scientific reasons.\n\nHe is betrayed by his ambitious and treacherous friend, Montagu Love as Baron Falon or Felon or something. (Who carries the juice, a Count or a Baron?) He wants to use the submersibles as weapons of war with which to conquer the world. Love takes over one of the submarines, holding Gadsden as hostage, while Barrymore and a few of his subordinates dive in the other.\n\nThe two wind up at the bottom of the ocean where they encounter strange creatures such as a horde of hostile humanoids living in cities and a couple of baby alligators with fins glued to their backs. They barely escape with their lives.\n\nUp to the surface again, where Love and his myrmidons are defeated by Barrymore and his workmen. Barrymore is dying. Before he does, he destroys the factory that built the devilish machines so that no one will be tempted to use them as weapons of war again. The audience is permitted a slight chuckle here.\n\nIt has a few tense moments. Barrymore and his daughter are both tortured by Love's hussars and they both project intolerable pain reasonably well.\n\nI mentioned that the special effects are primitive by today's standards. I don't mean that I kwell at the sight of CGIs parading across the screen and munching on people. It's just that these effects, as modern as they once might have been, are so crude as to be distracting. It's hard to get into an action scene when you're reminded, every second, that you're looking at miniatures.\n\nIt carries a relevant anti-war message, which I thought was fine but which some viewers might find noisome. At any rate some might find it more entertaining than I did.",

On land, there's a Russian revolution going on, while undersea hordes of fish-men creep across a bottom. That is, when an anemic octopus monster or a cardboard lizard monster are not flailing about. Meanwhile, aboard the submarines, lights flash, wheels whirl, and Russian peasants rush around doing something or other, earning their extra's pay. And all the time, someone with a hammer is banging on a pipe, maybe to test out the new-fangled sound technology. No, this is not planet Earth\u0097it's some wacko world an Eisenstein admirer has manufactured out of Jules Verne.\n\nThere may even be a plot lurking somewhere beneath all the pointless action and quirky sets. Something about an evil nobleman (Montague Love) using his cossacks to overthrow Dakkar's (Barrymore) peaceable kingdom where everybody is \"equal\". But he hasn't figured on guys in clunky diving suits who rescue an air compressor along with the girl. The end looks like an attempt to blow-up industrial society so everyone in the last scene can spend the day on Malibu beach, while the last nobleman goes to join the fishes. Looks like a good communist society to me.\n\nWhat's really memorable are those fish-men. There are hordes of them crawling soundlessly across a bottom in some twilight world. Their dark undulating mass is far creepier than the phony monsters. I don't know how Hollywood did it, but I've seen nothing like it before or since. In my book, it's the stuff of bad dreams and worth the whole crazy 90 minutes. Now, I know special effects make this antique look like the stone age. But I'll bet once you've seen this campy version, it's the one you'll most remember.",

The film tells the simple story of a scientist (Lionel Barrymore) who creates a submarine so that he can go to the bottom of the ocean to look for life. My main problem with the film is probably its historic nature in the fact that it was started as a silent film but production got pushed back so much that MGM decided to shoot some sound scenes and include them. The start of the film is sound and none of it worked for me. Like most early sound films, the dialogue was badly recorded and it really was boring and make me want to doze off. When the silent section, pretty much the rest of the film, started, I thought the film took off like a rocket. There was plenty of action from start to finish and I also enjoyed the underwater scenes. Hundreds of midgets were hired to play the sea creatures and I thought they looked pretty good. The alligator turned dinosaur was silly but the huge squid was nice. Barrymore, in the sound portion of the film, is all over the place but I thought his silent scenes were a lot better. I've always felt he was better in silents and to see him act here silent and sound was interesting to say the least.",

There are also above-surface issues of betrayal, palace coups, wars, and young love.\n\nMade on the cusp between silent and sound films, The Mysterious Island is caught somewhere in between; it is part talkie and part silent. Oddly there doesn't seem to be a dramatic or thematic rationale for deciding which scenes have sound and which don't. And why didn't the producers choose one format over the other for the entire movie? But they didn't, and this alone makes the film a novelty. Another reason to watch The Mysterious Island is the 1929-era special effects. They're a hoot.

Love at least appears to be paying attention to Barrymore, but you have to wonder what he was thinking. Probably: \"Boy, is he overacting all over the place!!\" Things don't get much better when the plot about fish people beneath the sea and submarines devised to go below surface--this is Jules Verne remember--well, you have it. It's all comic book stuff ruined by the use of fake miniatures and primitive B&W photography. The only performer who seems to be playing his role with any sense of normalcy is LLOYD HUGHES as the romantic lead.\n\nSumming up: A poor attempt to give this Jules Verne tale a proper transition to the screen--but unable to do so with a crazy blend of \"silent\" and \"talkie\" techniques that serve only to destroy all the possibilities of entertainment value.

Basically, its about count Dakar (real name Capitan nemo) who uses his crew for a underwater adventure while his kingdom is taken over by some guy so when they get there there's a giant alligator which they attack then they land. These fish people want the crew so they realise a giant octopus to capture them. The octopus kills one of the them then attacks the others but fails. They could have done better. I think the fight between the crew and the giant alligator should have lasted along with the octopus scene but it was still good! Was that even a giant alligator or a prehistoric monster/dinosaur. At the end, the kingdom is destroyed and Capitan nemo goes back under sea upset. The giant octopus was ugly and freaky. It was slow and could not swim in the film for some reason but it was cool that the army of fish people were with the octopus and was chasing the people. That octopus was so ugly, man but so cool. That giant alligator just appeared right when they got under the sea then the giant alligator spots them and attacks the sub but the alligator is hit by a torpedo then the giant creature fell off a cliff but was still alive and fled. I did expected this but i didn't expected it to be a short film but anyway it was weird that the begging had sound then the rest of the film had silent, what the hell? I liked how they did the octopus, better than the one in it came from beneath the sea. I cant believe the giant alligator scene, i expected it to be long because the giant alligator attacks the sub by hitting it but 15secs later, Capitan nemo shots the poor dinosaur then he falls off the cliff. Cool film, going under the sea then getting attacked by a giant alligator, giant octopus and little frog fish like people. I guess that place was the mysterious island. But why did count Dakar want to go under the sea if its inhabited by fish people, dinosaur and giant slug (first i was like 'giant slug?') then get one of there mates crusted by the tentacles. I didn't get the ending when count Dakar was like 'i don't have a life now that my island is destroyed' so then he goes back to the sub and gets to the sea, the end???? Did Capitan nemo kill himself by going under the sea by the guardian of the fish people, octopus because his kingdom was destroyed or did he want to go undersea for an adventure. I think he killed himself but couln't he build back his kingdom because he had all his citizens, soldiers and builders. Did the bad guy that got the kingdom blow up the place (well, actually not everything was destroyed)? Thats another question i don't understand, anyway they should improve the monster battles and make the film long. I give this a 10 out of 10 because its so cool. Buy this! Its 35 mins or less but its a good film.",

                "text": "\"The Mysterious Island\" is interesting mainly for either cinema or science fiction fanatics. Viewed today, it creeks horribly and was probably dated the day it came out. However, its fascinating just because it represents how many silent filmmakers were unable to make the transition to sound. The acting in the silent segments is adequate, but when the actors are required to read dialog (as opposed to performing pantomime), they are hopelessly incompetent (even the legendary Lionel Barrymore suffers). The meshing of both sound and silent scenes ruins any chance this film had at being exciting and gives it a slow pace. Its an unusual film to say the least.\n\nThere are a few amusing parts though, enough for making it worthwhile if it pops up on TV (Turner Classic Movies has been showing it lately). The underwater effects are primitive yet charming and often surreal because of their simplicity. The battles between the submarine crew and the sea people are definitely the highlights (even a giant octopus gets into the action). The story isn't really involving though (this is a name only adaptation of Jules Verne), so this overall holds interest for mainly early cinema buffs. (4/10)",

Senor Americano was likely one of the Maynard films released both as a sound and a silent film depending on the equipment of the individual theaters at the time. This review has to be from the silent standpoint.\n\nFor a movie with no sound there is a lot of music being played by the characters in Senor Americano. The opening scene with a fiesta has musicians. Manana (Frank Yaconelli) is seen with a guitar as he enters the movie alongside Michael Banning (Maynard). The bar scenes include musicians who even play during a fight scene. Manana teaches Banning a song to use to serenade Carmelita (Kathryn Crawford). Manana keeps Carmelita occupied with his singing. The movie is silent! There is no sound, but we are constantly shown musicians and singing! \n\nSenor Americano was a Ken Maynard film, so there had to be some great riding scenes. The movie starts off with Banning and Tarzan winning a horsemanship competition. Tarzan was an amazing horse. He must have been Trigger's idol when he was growing up.\n\nThe movie takes place around the town of San Rosario, a California town plagued by crime that hopes for annexation of California by the United States. Banning is secretly a military officer gathering information on criminals in San Rosario. Maddox (J.P. McGowan) and Ramirez (Gino Corrado) must steal the Spanish land grant papers from Don Manuel (Frank Beal) before the annexation takes place, but Banning works to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe opening credits have Ken Maynard listed as \"Lieut. Mitchen Banning\", but the end credits have him listed as \"Lieut. Michael Banning.\" The end credits are done in an entirely different style than the opening credits and may be from a different release. Throughout the movie Maynard's character is referred to as \"Michael.\"\n\nThis was a fun story that kept moving forward and remained interested for the entire time. If the tagline promised 85% dialog with songs, there must have been more than one release because I had to read the version I saw. This was prime Ken Maynard, but it would have been much better if I could have heard the music. It was probably a better movie with sound, but ultimately sound is not necessary to make a great movie.",

It came out in 1929, wholly silent, then with an evocative musical soundtrack added in 1931, composed by Marcello Lattes.\n\nThe story is of two young lovers, very poor and on the brink of suicide, who come into a bit of temporary good luck.  They find a wallet lost in a train station.  It is filled with money.  The man it belonged to has hopped a train, and returning it would be difficult (no ID perhaps?)  The two unnamed lovers, played by K\u00e4the von Nagy and Maurizio d'Ancora, compulsively hop a train themselves, and the rails ('rotaie') deliver them to two thrilling weeks of  high living, high dining, and high gambling in a casino. \n\n\nThe film's style is that of a fast-paced expressionistic work, no doubt influenced by the German cinema of the 1920s, particularly that of  F. W. Murnau, whose use of  tracking shots is imitated here, as is the lighting of that German master.  \n\nThere are also hints here of Murnau's 1928 American film \"Sunrise,\" and the movie has a similar progression of ascent to joy, turmoil followed by loss, disaster, and finally rebirth.  As \"Sunrise\" has its temptress, here there is a tempter in the person of seducer Jacques Mercier (played Daniele Crespi) who tries to have sex with the woman. \n\nThe hedonistic life comes to an abrupt end. Lucky at finding a wallet, the man is less lucky at casino gambling.  All is lost.  The rails bring the couple back to Rome. The man gets a job in a  Chaplin's-\"Modern Times\" factory.  All shall be happy and reasonable henceforward.\n\nThe lead performers are both excellent. For the role of the woman, Camerini considered the German Brigitte Helm (of Lang's \"Metropolis.\")  Maurizio D'Ancora, who plays the  guy, clearly had no failure of luck later on in life.

These films emphasize the thrill of the city, the industrial rhythm of the machines that affects in one way or another the citizens who live in a new and modern society and had to confront new social challenges and a new way of life that began when WWI ended.\n\nHaving in mind those ruminations quoted by this Herr Von above, \"Rotaie\" (1929) is an Italian film that can be considered as one of those \"industrial films\", a remarkable oeuvre in which a young couple lives in constant uncertainty, surrounded by a modern and inhuman city and its unscrupulous inhabitants and the couple finds their unconditional love in jeopardy.\n\nHerr Mario Camerini, director of the film, moves the camera in a vivid, agile way ( flashback, travellings ), and during the first part of the film uses rapid fire editing to capture the atmosphere of the city. The movie also shows the influence of European avant-garde film and, in the shadowy night sequences, the notorious German cinema. The latter scenes depict the vulnerability and helplessness of the young couple during their erratic wandering around the city and skilfully capture an oppressive and mean atmosphere. In spite of all this there is hope for a new start for the couple when they have an unexpected stroke of luck that allows them to escape the disquieting night and end up in a totally different place: a luxurious hotel full of decadent people. However, though the building may be shiny, it nevertheless hides the same night darkness inside.\n\nThe psychological portraits of the different characters of the film are quite interesting. There are carefree, heartless and even dehumanized beings who will try to take advantage of the couple's innocence and vulnerability. The two young people are aware of the dangers around them and consciously go with the tide, although at the end they will finally manage successfully to triumph over situations that almost put an end to their love. At last the tides of events drag them up to be a part of that new and industrial city turning them finally into a happy middle class couple.\n\n\"Rotaie\" is a late silent that bears witness to the social changes and challenges of the big city. It is technically well structured and presents an interesting portrait of the uncertainties of a changing society entering a modern and industrial world.\n\nAnd now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must deal with a strike in the aristocratic factory at the Rhine.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

Escape to a seaside resort doesn't solve their problems but eventually, they see their way.\n\nAdapted from Corrado D'Errico's story by director Mario Camerini, Rotaie reveals the considerable influence of German Expressionist Cinema in both content and technique. The camera hovers moodily over the couple as it tracks their movement, while angularity and mechanized abstraction conveys the tension and despair found in their modern, hostile world. As they find momentary respite from their fate, the internal movement of a clock is shown to mark the passage of time, while the violence of the locomotive conveys both escape and impending doom. Considering the darkness of this story, the decidedly Hollywood ending is a relief, but seems somewhat out of place.",

I was dazzled when I first sat through this film-- it seemed as if there was a kind of magic in the theatre that night. I can remember having goosebumps when Lillian Roth sang \"Why Am I So Romantic?\". \n\nI was working as manager of the Paris Theatre on 58th Street when \"Animal Crackers\" opened at the Sutton, and because both houses were part of the Cinema-5 circuit, I was always able to get passes. -- In this case, because I had also worked as 'relief manager' at The Sutton on many occasions, I was well known to the staff and had entry to that theatre whenever I wanted. --During the 'opening' run of \"Animal Crackers,\" I often walked over to The Sutton when my day's shift was complete at The Paris.\n\nI can tell you that every screening of \"Animal Crackers\" that I attended was packed. And every time I was present for the film's end, I witnessed a standing ovation-- something that many film producers can only dream of. \n\nI often tried to imagine myself attending a 'live' performance of this show. --As many have mentioned here, \"Animal Crackers\" was a hit Broadway show, starring the Marx Brothers, long before it was filmed by Paramount.\n\nRather than complaining that this film is \"stagey\", many who comment here would do well to remember that a film like this is as close to a Broadway show as millions of people will ever get. The annoying penchant some viewers have for wondering why the film version of a Broadway hit show (especially a musical-comedy) isn't more \"opened-up\" is both tiresome and moot.\n\nAlso, the constant comparison of \"Animal Crackers\" to other Marx Brothers films (especially the later MGM films) is an 'apples-to-oranges' kind of thing. It would make far more sense to compare it to other early filmed-versions of it's Broadway contemporaries, such as \"Rio Rita\" or \"Flying High\" or \"Girl Crazy\".... \n\nAlthough the stage show of \"Animal Crackers\" was on Broadway long before I was born, (and the film's initial premier pre-dates me by almost as long), I am forever gratified to have been able to attend the 1974 \"re-opening\" of the film in New York, and to see, feel, and participate in, the audiences' jubilant reactions. \n\nI rated this film 10/10. It's a perfect comedy, with (theatre-goers will recognize this-) honest-to-goodness Broadway music-- and with Lillian Roth, too. \"Animal Crackers\" is a great show in every respect.\n\nHungadunga!",

                "text": "Animal Crackers is one of the best films ever done by the 4 Marx Brothers. For a start, the comedy completely works on screen, especially considering that the film was adapted from the musical stage play. And although Zeppo's comedy has always been underrated and underplayed in the five films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures, he proves in this film, as well as the four other movies he appeared with Groucho, Chico, and Harpo, that the 4 Marx Brothers made better films when the four of them worked together; as opposed to when it was just Groucho, Chico and Harpo. All the Marx Brothers films which included Zeppo were zanier films and, to me, the best of their work. Verbally, Groucho is at his razor-sharp best in Animal Crackers, with almost every one-liner dripping with comedic insults and sarcasm. Chico and Harpo perfectly add to the mayhem. The direction by Victor Heerman showed the type of skill needed to professionally control the 4 Marx Brothers to make Animal Crackers the tremendous success that it was. Though the Great Depression was taking hold on the American psyche in 1930, Animal Crackers was the perfect comedy which allowed ordinary Americans to enjoy the spoofing of America's 'Hoi Polloi'.\n\nThough the 4 Marx Brothers' succeeding films (Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup) were even more of the Hollywood film-style comedy successes which crystalized their zaniness and on-screen craziness, one should not underestimate the cinematography of George Folsey, Sr., who made the film look like a movie written especially for the screen. The look of the film (specifically the sets) makes one feel like he or she wished they had been invited to Mrs. Rittenhouse's party in honor of Captain Spaulding. Lillian Roth never looked better, and the best song in the film is her musical number with Hal Thompson, \"Why Am I So Romantic?\" - which was the theme music for the entire movie. Animal Crackers is one of my favorite films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures - although all five films made at Paramount are absolute gems. I strongly suggest getting the Marx Brothers' Silver Screen Collection, which is now on DVD. They are a must for your film library!",

                "text": "\nJudging by the script, you'd never believe that \"Animal Crackers\" is over seventy years old.  Think of all the \"postmodern\" things that happen in this movie: Groucho directly addresses the audience to apologize for a bad joke; Harpo shoots a gun at a statue, only to see the statue come to life and return fire; and Margaret Dumont freezes in time while Groucho has a \"strange interlude\" and rambles to the audience about the perils of marriage and living with your folks!  Of course, the absolutely ancient and decaying print will remind you that \"Animal Crackers\" is older than the hills, but otherwise, it's much fresher and weirder than the stuff that passes for comedy today.\n\nLike \"The Cocoanuts,\" this movie is based on a play, and as such it is considerably longer and stagier than most of the later Marx movies.  The pace does drag a bit towards the end, especially since the plot disappears (along with Zeppo) for long segments at a time.  But many of the individual segments are classic, including the often (and rightly) praised bridge game and Harpo's gag with the cutlery-filled sleeves.  Even the music segments hold up well, particularly Chico's piano routine that gets savaged by Groucho.\n\nInterestingly, there is a prominent romantic subplot to this film, which puts paid to the fallacy that Marx Brothers movies didn't have romances until MGM got its hands on them.  However, the romance isn't nearly as intrusive or annoying here as in their later vehicles, so there's still plenty of reason to be annoyed with good old MGM...    \n",

                "text": "The first two surviving Marx Brothers films were based on their second and third major Broadway successes: THE COCONUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS. As early movies they suffer from the rigidity of the early talkies. Papers used as props on the set had to be wet in order for the crackling of paper to be reduced as much as possible from being picked by the microphones. It is remarkable that the films survived to continue to bring pleasure to audiences. In the case of ANIMAL CRACKERS, for years it and the later A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA were tied up in copy-write problems that prevented them being released to the public. I did not see it until I went with my sister to see the film in 1974 in Manhattan.\n\nThis film is the one that established Groucho Marx's theme song, \"Hooray For Captain Spaulding.\" Groucho's Jeffrey T. Spaulding has just returned from Africa, and has been invited to the Long Island estate of Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont). Her guests include the noted art collector and expert Roscoe W. Chandler (Louis Sorin). He's going to reveal a masterpiece of art that he has purchased. Mrs. Rittenhouse's \"friend\" and rival Mrs. Whitehead plans to steal the painting, and hide it to embarrass her hostess. Her daughter and her ex-butler Hives (Robert Greig) are in on this plot. Meanwhile Mrs. Rittenhouse's daughter Arabella (Lillian Roth) is trying to help her boyfriend John Parker (Hal Thompson), a struggling artist prove his abilities. Other guests include the musician, Signior Emmanuel Ravelli and the Professor (Chico and Harpo) and Spaulding's secretary Horation Jamison (Zeppo).\n\nThere are many similarities between this musical's book and THE COCONUTS, such as both having detectives named Hennesey, and both naming Zeppo Jamison. The struggles of Roth standing by her struggling painter-boyfriend mirror the struggles of Mary Eaton supporting her struggling architect-boyfriend Oscar Shaw. But here Groucho is a visitor, not the hotel owner/manager. And here there is more use for Zeppo. In fact, except for the third film (MONKEY BUSINESS)and the fifth film (DUCK SOUP), Zeppo never had as much to do that was funny in any of the Marx Brothers movies than here. He has to take dictation from Groucho regarding the legal team of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, and McCormick (pronounced \"Hoongerdoonger\"). It is a classic Marx routine. \n\nThere are some topical humor. Roscoe W. Chandler is a spoof on the noted millionaire and culture maven Otto Kahn, head of the Board of the Metropolitan Opera. Kahn was trying to find a location for the new opera house in the late 1920s, and we hear Chandler and Groucho discussing possibly putting it into Central Park. Kahn was from the old Wilhelmine Empire, and was an immigrant (though one who made good in banking). Chandler, in one stunning moment with Chico, turns out to be Abe Kabible, a fish peddler from Czechoslovakia (Chandler has to pay some blackmail to Chico and Harpo about this, but he does shoot back at Chico an inquiry of how long he's been an Italian!). \n\nAnother topical jab is regarding Eugene O'Neill's STRANGE INTERLUDE, where O'Neill had characters speak their minds separately from the regular dialog with each other. In fact, Groucho even admits he is going into a strange interlude of his own. His comments are spoken in a clipped, sad voice, and include a final set of lines where he sounds portentous - talking about strange figures, weird figures. Then he starts giving stock quotations!\n\nThe film is a little slow at spots, as was THE COCONUTS, but the brothers do well, as does Lillian Roth and Margaret Dumont. The film is very entertaining, and it is good that it is still around.",

The plot concerns a wild, out of control explorer's (Groucho Marx) visit to a Long Island estate.   He comes across stuffy snobs and a questionable musician for hire (Chico Marx and his lunatic partner, Harpo.) Groucho's dialog is superb.

After they went to Hollywood, with the exception of Room Service, all their material was original for the screen. \n\nThe Brothers were doing Animal Crackers on Broadway in 1928-1929 and it had a respectable run of 191 performances. In fact while they were doing Animal Crackers on stage, for a part of 1929 they were shooting The Cocoanuts at the Astoria Studios. Unlike The Cocoanuts, nearly the entire Broadway cast was used in the film, with the exception of the juveniles, Lillian Roth and Hal Thompson. Also unlike The Cocoanuts nearly the entire Bert Kalmar-Harry Ruby score was discarded with the notable exception of Groucho's immortal theme Hooray for Captain Spalding. Kalmar and Ruby did write the ballad that Roth and Thompson sing, Why Am I So Romantic for the screen version.\n\nMargaret Dumont as Mrs. Rittenhouse of the Long Island horsey set is throwing a party and the guest of honor is Groucho with his secretary Zeppo as Captain Spalding. Crashing the party is Chico and Harpo.\n\nBut not only is Captain Spalding on display, Dumont is giving an unveiling of a famous painting for which two people have brought copies for different purposes.

It turned out to be too good a satire because when the play made it to the screen two years later, no one took it seriously.\n\nSecondly is Chico and Harpo, mercilessly threatening to expose hoity toity art critic Louis Sorin who they knew back in the day as Abie the Fishman. Actually that's kind of sad in a way because Sorin may be a snob now, but he did in fact educate himself out of peddling fish and rose in an honorable to a legitimate living. But you don't think about that while Chico and Harpo are doing their thing.\n\nAlthough like The Cocoanuts it's a photographed stage play, Animal Crackers works a whole lot better.

That's a rarity for the Marx Bros. movies, where typically the two young people shoehorned in for a romantic subplot are the worst part of the picture.

Every modern cinema so-called comedian ( Sandler,,Wilson,,Stiller,,,the list goes on) should be strapped to a chair in front of these guys and be educated in how to make funny. The haunting silence of Harpo just shows how clever he was to make us laugh without speaking ,just using whistles , props and honkers. Chico plays the straight but funny guy perfectly and Groucho steals every scene. While it does look like a filmed stage play it adds to the vaudeville silliness. If ever you need cheering up put this on..I literally laughed till i nearly cried..God bless 'em all!!",

                "text": "The greatest thing about the Marx Brothers was the diversity of their comedy. Groucho was ultimately a master of the one-liners, Chico alluded to ethnic stereotypes that were popular during his days doing vaudeville, and Harpo was the clown, pulling sight gags from every pocket he had in that huge overcoat he wore. Animal Crackers, their second film as The Marx Brothers, allows them free reign to indulge in their manic brand of comedy due to an absence of plot. What is immediately apparent upon viewing the film is just how postmodern it is. Groucho laments his inner thoughts to camera and a statue shoots back at a startled Harpo, all combining to make one truly insane 95 minutes, made all the more risqu\u00e9 with this being before the introduction of the Hays Code.\n\nFamour explorer Captain James T. Spaulding (Groucho) arrives at a house party hosted by the upper-class Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont). Whilst there, he manages to swindle, insult and charm the various guests who are in attendance, namely Roscoe Chandler (Louis Sorin), an art collector who has brought one his most prized paintings to display to the guests. Also there is musician Signor Ravelli (Chico) and his mad sidekick The Professor (Harpo), who are harbouring a plan to steal the painting and replace it with a forgery. Unfortunately for them, there are others who wish to pull off the same trick for different reasons.\n\nWhile the songs are nice and catchy (Groucho's intro song \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" was used in TV quiz show You Bet Your Life, which Groucho hosted), the technical aspects suffer the same way as many films did with the sudden introduction of sound. The screen is crammed with characters, much like a play would be, and this sense of disorganisation takes a little away from the film.\n\nBut it is all about the comedy after all, and here all three of the brothers are on top form, with Groucho providing the killer lines \"one day I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know\" and \"we took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed. But we're going back again in a couple of weeks!\" (Zeppo also appears, but only briefly). When the plot becomes too ridiculous or the action moves away from the Marx Brothers, stick around for another 30 seconds and they'll be something else to laugh at - it's just that funny.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

                "text": "More than 30 years ago when I was a kid, I remember watching this movie on CBS on a Saturday but the only parts I remembered were the \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" number, a duet between the romantic leads, Harpo's harp solo, and the ending. So now I've watched the entire thing on DVD and let me tell you, it's a lot better than The Four Marx Brothers' previous movie, The Cocoanuts. For one thing, not only do we get another confused wordplay between Chico and Groucho but also that between Chico and Harpo when the latter pulls something different when the former asks for a \"flash\"! Besides Chico, Harpo also plays a little on the piano this time to another comic sequence they do with Groucho. Oh, and while Zeppo didn't do much in the last one, here he does some funny bits with Groucho concerning some dictation of a letter. And Margaret Dumont more than earns her \"fifth Marx Brother\" reputation with her own lines and actions with the brothers not to mention her laughs during many of them. I also liked seeing Lilian Roth, so soon after just watching her in The Love Parade, as one part of that romantic duo I referenced at the beginning of this review and though she's more subdued here than in TLP, she's still enjoyable (not to mention stunning to watch) here. If there's one disappointment in watching this again, it's that the line from Groucho's in that \"Captain Spaulding\" number-\"I think I'll go and make her\"-is still missing. Still, this was a most enjoyable Marx Brothers movie and that's good enough for me! P.S. When I read Steve Stoliar's book \"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House\", the most fascinating find there was his contribution to getting this movie back in re-release in the 1970s after disappearing from circulation a couple of decades ago. So we have him to thank, along with survivor Groucho's help, for this being available again.",

                "text": "\"Tell me, what do you think of the traffic problem? What do you think of the marriage problem? What do you think of at night when you go to bed, you beast?\" While not their best film (which I still insist is \"A Night at the Opera\"), \"Animal Crackers\" is still a zany, no-holds-barred slice of laugh-a-second entertainment from the never dull Marx Brothers - a quasi-musical comedy with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from the siblings, featuring some very memorable moments. Here are a few of my favorite: The scene in which Groucho stands between the two women at the bottom of the staircase and diverges and digresses from an inexplicable monologue is outstanding, and one of his shining moments. The payoff is when the group of sexy women parade down the stairs where he declares that he's been waiting for years at the bottom of the steps for such an occasion.\n\nPerhaps one of Harpo's best acts is the Bridge scene, where he and Chico sit down with two ladies for a game. His skill with props and his perfect timing has always astounded me ... he was, in my opinion, the hardest working Marx Brother. I also feel he does his best harp playing in this film.\n\nChico's highlight was, of course, his scene on the piano. Although the film does seem to take an awkward break here just to see him play, it's nonetheless a pleasure to enjoy his skill and the obvious delight he takes in showing it off.\n\nLike all of their features, by the end of the story everyone around the brothers have been driven mad by their antics and nonsensical behavior, and you leave the film no deeper or enlightened than you were before, but simply with a big smile on your face.",

Groucho and Chico's verbal sparring is tighter, and Harpo is now the perfect scene-stealer with his bottomless coat and his lustful, lecherous chasing of pretty blondes. My favorite scene has Chico asking Harpo to get out his flashlight (which he pronounces \"flash\") and Harpo produces a fish, a garden flitz, a tin flask, his own skin, five cards all the same suit, and a blackjack before pulling out his flashlight. Some of the subplots still distract from the Brothers' act, but they aren't as annoying as before. Margaret Dumont is in fine form here, though I wonder how well audiences responded to Chico and Harpo attacking her (I didn't). I have a theory about Zeppo, and how he could have spruced up his straight-man routine. He should have been less mellow. When Groucho is dictating his nonsensical letter, I wanted to see Zeppo getting annoyed, rolling his eyes, and slowly getting more distressed as the scene goes on.\n\nKEVIN: The Marx Brothers begin to find their stride on the silver screen with their second feature Animal Crackers. We watched this film last year with the Marxes' other Paramount films, and I soon forgot everything that happened in this film, as everything became blurred with the other films. So watching it by itself helped a lot in retaining and remembering all the gags. This time the laughs are tethered by a plot involving a stolen painting at a high society party, a sometimes confusing story point that, once again, doesn't require much attention from the audience. Just pay attention to the brothers' refined routines, including Groucho's \"strange interludes\" while talking bigamy to Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont) and her daughter, a bizarre game of bridge with Chico and Harpo, and Zeppo's exasperated secretary taking down a tongue-twisting letter for Groucho. And don't forget Harpo's coat with the endless props as Chico demands his flashlight (\"The flash!\") and he pulls out a fish, a flitz, a flask, a flush (my favorite), and even his own flesh. I didn't like the bridge game as much, because it was too long and we have to be especially eagle-eyed to catch all the gags. Also, the supporting filler players were much more tolerable this time, as were the songs. All in all, the Marx boys are definitely showing that they can deliver on celluloid.\n\nLast film viewed: The Big House (1930). Last film chronologically: Monte Carlo (1930).

T. Spaulding (Groucho Marx), the African explorer, accompanied by his personal secretary, introduced, but a film adaptation to the 1928 Broadway play by George F. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind starring those four Marx Brothers in\n\nHoratio Jamieson (Zeppo Marx); and Roscoe W. Chandler (Louis Sorin), a fish peddler posing as a wealthy European art patron, who is to exhibit Beaugard's famous painting, \"After the Hunt\" valued at $100,000. Also in attendance are musicians Emanuel Ravelli (Chico Marx) and his partner, the Professor (Harpo Marx), who spends much of his time chasing girls. Mrs. Rittenhouse has a vivacious daughter named Arabella (Lillian Roth), whose romantic interest is John Parker (Hal Thompson), an struggling young artist who has made a copy of the Beaugard while as a student in Paris. Because John's painting looks so much like the original, Arabella stumbles upon an idea of switching the paintings in hope that at the unveiling his work will be recognized so that they could get married. She hires Ravelli and the Professor to help with the switch. At he same time, Grace Carpenter (Kathryn Reece), who has also made a copy of the painting while in art school, decides to make the switch as well, with the help of Mrs. Whitehead (Margaret Irving), a society friend of Mrs. Rittenhouse. Hives (Robert Greig), a former employer of Mrs. Whitehead with a questionable past, now under Mrs. Rittenhouse's employ, agrees to assist her with the switch. When the painting is discovered missing, Inspector Hennessy (Edward Metcalfe) and his men are called to investigate, but after the paintings are recovered, confusion arises when no one is able to determine the copies from the original.\n\nANIMAL CRACKERS spoofs high society, eliminating much of the songs originated from the play, focusing more on the comedic gags than plot, stretching its limited scenario to 97 minutes, becoming longest of the Marx comedies for Paramount. The surviving tunes, composed by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar include: \"You Must Do Your Best Tonight\" (sung by Robert Greig and The Music Masters); \"I Represent\" (sung by Zeppo Marx); \"Hello, I Must be Going\" (sung by Groucho Marx); \"Hooray For Captain Spaulding\" (sung by Groucho, Zeppo, Margaret Dumont, and guests); \"Why Am I So Romantic?\" (sung by Lillian Roth and Hal Thompson, harp solo by Harpo Marx). Of the songs, two have become synonymous with Groucho: \"Hello I Must Be Going\" used as a title of one of his biographies, and \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" becoming the opening and closing theme song to Groucho's 1950s radio/ TV game show, YOU BET YOUR LIFE.\n\nBesides its stage origins, COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS each have something in common: both were filmed at Paramount's Astoria studios in New York; younger brother Zeppo assumes the character name of Jamieson; the plot involves thievery, followed by the presence of a police inspector named Hennessy. Unlike the other Marx comedies, ANIMAL CRACKERS was the only one unavailable for viewing due to some sort of copyright dispute, with the sad possibility of never to be shown again again. After many years of uncertainty, ANIMAL CRACKERS was finally resurrected in revival theaters in 1974, much to the delight of many Marx Brothers fans, and premiered on network television (CBS) on that historic evening July 21, 1979. Afterwards, it was presented on numerous cable channels, such as Arts and Entertainment, American Movie Classics (1991-92) and finally Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: December 17, 2001). Due to its sort-after popularity, it was one of the first Marx Brothers comedies distributed on video cassette in the 1980s, and can currently be seen and appreciated in its DVD format.\n\nAlthough a huge success during its initial release, ANIMAL CRACKERS is not as funny as the Marx's previous effort. Production values have much improved over its prehistoric visuals of THE COCOANUTS, but as Groucho points out while looking towards the camera, \"Well, all the jokes can't be good. You got to expect that once in a while.\" He's so right. It's not so much the odd mixture of good and bad jokes combined that weakens the film, but some dated doings that are a total loss for viewers today, namely Groucho doing a \"Strange Interlude\" by speaking his thoughts out to the audience, or making a reference to character actor \"Chic\" Sale. (Who?) The Groucho/Chico exchanges don't come close to the height of hilarity as their \"Why a Duck\" skit from THE COCOANUTS, particularly with Chico's deduction of the painting stolen by \"left handed moths.\" (What?) Of the leading ladies assisting in the romantic subplot, Lillian Roth is a welcome change of pace from the sophisticated, straightforward actresses due to her down-to-earth and lively screen presence. She and Hal Thompson do get a chance to have a duet song to themselves. It's no highlight, but not bad either. Margaret Dumont's encounter with Groucho's love making,along with her card game with Chico and Harpo are truly memorable. And poor Zeppo. While he's the first Marx Brother to make an appearance, he's more off-screen than on. In conclusion, ANIMAL CRACKERS remains an amusing vintage Marx comedy that will never disappear again. \"Hooray, hooray, hooray!\" (***)",

Animal Crackers is one such movie.  The \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" song in the early going shows just how little respect the brothers have for the goofy musical numbers of the 20's, 30's and 40's and how it's open season and equal opportunity ripping on just about everything.

Scenes like the aforementioned Captain Spaulding song, the card game and the left handed moth argument are hilarious.The plot centers around the theft of a painting while the brothers are staying at a country house.

Anarchic comedy that follows in the same pattern as The Cocounuts(1929).\n\n\n\nThe acting is very good and a few of the scenes are highlights in the Marx Brothers Comedy Cannon.

A film that was ahead of its time in dialogue.\n\n\nThe story involves the theft of a painting by a famous painter.  Harpo Marx just gives me plenty of laughs whenever I see this or any other Marx Brothers picture.  Animal Cracker(1930) reminds of the comedy antics of Monty Python.  One can see where many later comedy teams and individuals got their influences from when you see a Marx Brothers film.\n\n\nGood picture that's not in the same league as a Duck Soup(1933) or a Night at the Opera(1935) but is much better than The Big Store(1941) or Love Happy(1950).

Having been adapted from one of their Vaudeville shows, many of the comic bits drag on too long, or don't work as well as they would have on stage.

Those are my favorites, and all three have zany plots. \n\n\"Animal Crackers\" was the second feature film the brothers made, when Zeppo was part of the acting team. In place of a plot it has a thin line of a story used just to string together dozens of vaudeville skits and bits. Some are very dated and of interest only to see what people laughed at a century ago in entertainment theaters. \n\nThe filming appears stagy, as if it was done during live vaudeville acts. The performers often speak to the audience off stage. And it has a stage feel even to the point of an echo and sound reverberations as from a sound stage with poor acoustics.\n\nSome of the lines still are funny today.

So of course it's a little \"creaky\" or \"stagey\", as this was originally a musical for the stage and the technology didn't allow for much in the way of innovation. And yet it speaks to how fabulously insane the Marx's were that they make as good an argument for sound being introduced to the movies as any other.\n\nIt's got a threadbare plot, as might be expected - Captain Spaulding comes in from being away in Africa to Margaret Dumont's mansion, and a \"Professor\" (good ol' Harpo) and Signor Ravelli (Chico) follow along, and there's a missing/stolen painting plot point - but who needs a plot with these guys? The joy is seeing what Spaulding will say to Dumont next, or how quickly Harpo will chase after the woman and then get into a rather bizarre series of card-shuffling (or not shuffling really), or how Chico can twist words and meaning around through his interactions. Zeppo is... also there too! \n\nI think that you either tap into this old-school madness or you don't. I feel sorry for those who don't but can sort of understand how some of this may seem uh 'dated' or even borderline \"un-PC\" (there may be some jokes at the expense of girls getting hit, but it's from Harpo so I find myself laughing anyway, I mean, look at the guy!) Not every moment is always sparking on comedic cylinders, and there's one point where the movie kind of stops for a romantic song (though it is genuinely, sweetly romantic) and Harpo playing the, well, the harp (is that where he gets the name?!)\n\nAnd of course there's Groucho throwing insult after insult in such a flow that it comes close to something like poetry or iambic pentameter for comic insults (peppered with an occasionally 4th wall break so that we know what's what). But all of the gags work off each other since there's dialog zingers, visual gags, and timing from the 'straight' players that makes it all come flying.

And what a delight to see the movie illuminated by the towering and exquisite presence of the divine Margaret Dumont, the straightest and funniest 'straight man' of comedy, even more than the not-so-funny-even-as-a-straight-man Zeppo Marx. With all due respect for the little bro, I've always thought he was less funny (even unintentionally) than the other unsung Marx, named Karl. And Margaret Dumont is one of the reasons, I love watching a Marx Brothers' comedy \u0085 yeah talk about a lousy pleonasm \u0085 \n\n\"You mind if I'm serious a little bit, now?\" There's something very touching in Margaret Dumont's eyes, here playing Mrs. Rittenhouse, a kind of inner kindness that I noticed in a few other actresses, among them, the late Patricia Neal. Mrs. Dumont is obviously a good-hearted woman, whose constant teasing by Groucho Marx, here as the unbearable Professor Spaulding makes the game look a little unfair. But she obviously doesn't get his wisecracking jokes (she never did for that matter) and I think this is what saves Groucho from being labeled as a verbal bully: his delivery is so fast, and his intentions so unclear, Mrs. Dumont never has time to get if he's making jokes or moves at her, who knows? Maybe he does have a fondness for her, after all. Anyway, the Groucho-Dumont interactions are the salt that gives the Marx Brothers' film their unique flavor, the pepper being served from the Zeppo-Chico duo \u0085 and boy, did I sneeze in this film! \n\nThe slapstick humor involving the scenes with Chico and Harpo are unique in the history of cinema, the part where he's looking for a 'flash' is an endless succession of gags, and whenever I thought, they would run out of ideas, it's still goes on and on\u0085 and Harpo's suit is like a Pandora' box from which the mayhem that inhabits the film makes its unpredictable entrance. Not to mention the sumptuous \"running gag\" with the blonde girl that has probably been an inspiration for Benny Hill. Chico and Harpo are like the missing link between Groucho and Chaplin, between the comedic silent era and the precocious dawn of the impertinent wisecracking comedy that has inspired Bugs Bunny or Robin Williams. The movie is an explosive cocktail of slapstick, parody, verbal comedy, from beginning to end and it's so quotable; I could fill this whole review just by listing the lines I loved the most.\n\nBut sometimes, the film loses its flavor \u0085 and it's my small, tiny, microscopic criticism, perhaps ... why do they feel the need to inject an artificial romance every time, except maybe for \"A Night at the Opera\", most of them were pretty dull, featuring very uncharismatic actors. Well it's not their fault, every actor would pale in comparison with the Marx brothers, except Margaret Dumont who had the honor to be Groucho's official foil and was \u0096as I said- even more memorable than Zeppo Marx himself. But well, even acting-wise, the other actors are all very theatrical and so melodramatic that we can't wait for a Marx brother to come ... the Marxes were great actors, and Groucho is so fresh and modern, he's like a living anachronism. His entrance as the Professor Spaulding followed by the unforgettable \"Hello, I Must be Going\" song, the 'Hungadunga' dictation scene, the recitation of the African odyssey, featuring one of the most unforgettable comedic quotes, I don't know how many times they shot this scenes without having one of the audience bursting out laughing. For me, any Marx Brothers' film scene should feature one of them, and during the 'romantic' moments, I simply wanted to shout \"Let me know, when you come near a gag!\" \n\nAnd that's why, Duck Soup is probably considered the greatest, and happens to be my favorite Marx Brothers' film, a screwball comedy, from A like Amusing to Z like Zany, with no pause, no romantic subplot, not even these serious musical scenes ... I'm not talking about these catchy Broadway-type songs that reminded us that the Brothers' were also great musical writers, don't get me wrong, Chico at the piano, and Harpo at you-know-what, are always great moments and necessary pauses to recover your breath, and in the case of \"Animal Crackers\", the music was punctuated with Spaulding's hilarious comments anyway, but that's what the latest films lacked, when the musical scenes were just fillers as artificial as the romantic subplots \u0085 \n\nSo, my little regret is that the best Marx Brothers' film I saw, was the first. I always compare them to \"Duck Soup\" and I'm afraid I will never have the same ecstatic reaction the film inspired me. Enthusiastic, yes, ecstatic, no ... \"Animal Crackers\" is now, my second favorite Marx Brothers film though and highly recommended for the fans of slapstick and irreverent comedy \u0085",

Normally I start with the most famous film, which would be \"Duck Soup,\" but I decided to begin my journey into 1930s comedy from the beginning.\n\nThe film stars Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo and Margaret Dumont. It begins as typical Hollywood fare circa 1920 when it was believe you couldn't make a film without any music and singing in it. This certainly holds back the Marx Brothers, whose brand clearly thrives in a context that their slightly more modern counterpart, The Three Stooges, would later receive -- no music, just physical humor and ridiculousness. Of course the difference in wit between these two acts is tremendous, but there's no question that Hollywood was less ready to embrace these brothers.\n\nAs mentioned, the plot is useless. The bustling estate of Mrs. Rittenhouse (Dumont) receives a visitor in the form of Jeffrey T. Spaulding (Groucho) back from a hunting trip in Africa and in the midst of the socializing, a valued painting is discovered missing. Honestly, the film has a few too many moments sprinkled throughout in which none of the Marx Brothers appear. Considering the only entertainment is when they grace the screen, it's unfortunate.\n\nThe physical elements of the humor via Harpo are timeless, but what makes the Marx Brothers special is the sharp verbal wit embodied by Groucho through puns, sexual innuendo, contradictions in terms and defying expectation. He does it all so quickly and smoothly and simply put, no comedian since has been able to touch it. Throw in the patented rolling back of the eyes and you get why he was such an icon from the get-go.\n\nThen there's the talent factor. Harpo plays harp for maybe five minutes and for some reason its mesmerizing. A little before, Chico plays piano an comic fashion. You simply can't believe these aren't musician doubles, but coming from Vaudeville, these guys had to have all the tools, primarily humor and musicianship. These scenes also help bridge the gap between the expectations of audiences in the late '20s early '30s to see musical performances and the Marx Brothers' humor.\n\n\"Animal Crackers\" bores in terms of story, but as a successful showcase for comedic and musical talent for some of the finest actors whoever gave it a go, it suffices.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

That's not to say I don't like the Marx Brothers \u0096 I do \u0096 but I don't feel an overwhelming urge to watch one of their films every now and then, the way I do with L&H.\n\nI don't remember seeing this one before, and it didn't start off well with a lengthy musical introduction. The boys playing piano or harp were fine, but those musical sections really kill the film for me (and for some perverse reason I find it impossible to use the FF button when watching a film, no matter how lousy parts of it may be). Anyway, most of the music \u0096 apart from one song \u0096 is out of the way after the first twenty minutes and the boys get down to doing what they do best. Some of the gags still hold up remarkably well today, even though they're nearly eighty years old. It leaves you wondering whether the brothers were waiting impatiently for Hollywood to develop sound movies so that they could bring their act to a wider audience \u0096 because there's no doubt that their's was a type of comedy made for sound, and that their success was a key element in the failure of most silent comedians to succeed in the sound era.\n\nThe storyline is unimportant and is merely there to give some form to the film. Groucho uses the stately Margaret Dumont as a verbal punchbag \u0096 with some jokes near enough to the knuckle to ensure that they would never have passed the censors just a few years later. (\"This magnificent ch- er, this magnificent chest,\" he stutters, glancing away from Ms. Dumont's voluminous bosom to the trunk in front of him). Some of the gags seem improvised, but never lower the quality of the writing, and just check out how long that first scene between Groucho's Spaulding and Chandler goes on without a cut.\n\nPerhaps the film's biggest weakness is the inclusion of Zeppo Marx in the cast. He never looks comfortable on screen, and it's hardly surprising that he soon decided to call it a day in front of the cameras. Watch him In that final scene, the way in which, from being at the front of the crowd, he backs into it before simply turning around and quietly walking away until he disappears off screen.",

But as far as I'm concerned this is a GOOD thing, especially inasmuch as it heightens the displacement effect of Groucho's wild nonsequiturs: he is interrupted by two miscues on the musical fanfare and then supplies a third himself, repeatedly steps out of a dialogue scene to sonorously address the camera, and rides a flubbed line by the seemingly dunderheaded Louis Sorin to a full minute of gloriously transparent and sharp-edged improvisation. The plot doesn't get in the way, the love interest is actually kind of cute thanks to the goofy Lillian Roth, and the songs are portioned out sparingly and strategically.

There are insane puns, non sequiturs, total gibberish, bizarre arty references (a series of asides spoofing the style of Eugene O'Neill's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Strange Interlude), and daring double-entendre (\"Signor Ravelli's first selection will be Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping with a male chorus.\"). In particular, Chico and Groucho's sparring is totally cracked - \"For playing, we get ten dollars an hour.\" - \"And for not playing ?\" - \"Twelve dollars an hour.\".

The action occurs in one location. High Society dame Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont) invites Captain Spaulding to be her guest of honor at her palatial, Long Island estate.He arrives via a sedan chair lugged by a quartet of African-Americans. Affluent art patron Roscoe W. Chandler (Louis Sorin) plans to unveil Beaugard's famous painting \"After the Hunt\" to celebrate Spaulding's fame. Initially, Mrs. Rittenhouse's daughter Arabella (Lillian Roth of 'Madam Satan\") plans to marry below her social status to a painter who is penniless. He has only sold two paintings in his life. The ever optimistic Arabella (Lillian Roth) thinks that if Johnny showed his paintings to Chandler that the latter might give the former some painting jobs. Meantime, Mrs. Whitehead (Margaret Irving) and her friend Grace (Kathryn Reece)plan to play a prank on Mrs. Rittenhouse. Mrs. Whitehead convinces Mrs. Rittenhouse's butler, Hives (Robert Greig) to substitute Grace's copy of the Beaugard for the real Beaugard. While Captain Spaulding flirting with Mrs. Rittenhouse, Emanuel Ravelli (Chico Marx) shows up with the Professor (Harpo Marx) who goes on a shooting rampage at one point. He shoots a clock, a bird cage, ladies' hats, a bottle on a tray, and two battling statues. The thief of the Beaugard eventually draws the police into the crime while Captain Spaulding struggles to recover the painting. Clocking in at 97 minutes, \"Animal Crackers\" contains lots of laughs!",

The film beginnings with what later became Groucho Marx's anthem (Hooray for Captain Spaulding) and the Craziness goes from there. Whether it's Groucho insulting everyone in sight or whether its Harpo chasing every woman in close perimeter. No lovers leading the story, just the Marx Brothers doing what they do best, upsetting the high society establishment. The musical is even funny and is only contained to Chico playing two songs. The best scene I think that can sum up not only this movie but the great mix of wit and physical comedy can be found in the card playing scene with Margaret Dumont, Chico, and Harpo. At first, the scene is entirely physical comedy almost mimicking that of three stooges, but when they sit down to play cards the quick wit of the Marx Brothers is quickly shown and if you're not paying attention you will have to watch the scene several times to understand everything that's going on.",

The film skips by, while the script is witty and sharp with some hilarious lines such \"Did somebody call me schnorrer\"(one of my favourite ever entrances in a Marx film) and the sight gags are clever and brilliantly timed, the part when Groucho shoots an elephant in his pyjamas is just hysterical.

It was a different time than any we can possibly conceive of at this moment. And yet there was this fabulous entertainment industry still barreling on and barely able to keep up with itself.\n\nThe Four Marks Brothers (once five) had been Broadway headliners since the early Twenties. Prior to that, they struggled for years in Vaudeville. This film - Animal Crackers (their second) - capitalizes nicely on existing material from the stage -- the first to really bring out the brilliance in the their great musical collaboration with the songwriting team Kalmar and Ruby, from which most of the famous Marx Brothers songs emerged over the next decade or so.\n\nTechnically, yes - the film is relatively primitive -- with mic booms too far away or poorly aimed, rickety camera work {note Chico's awkwardly-filmed entrance as he rockets down the steps of Mrs. Rittenhouse's mansion.}, and somewhat naiive scene editing. Scenes went on and on, possibly because it was known among comedy filmmakers that audiences laughed, and the laughs required slower transitions, so as not to miss dialogue during the screening.\n\nBut as a record of what the Marx Brothers were doing on Broadway around that time, this film is a national treasure. Groucho is not, as is the current custom, lip-synching his songs. Live, in the midst of his initial seen with Margaret DuMont, a chime is struck off camera (an \"E\") and Groucho sings \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" in the right key (\"A\"). It's utterly fascinating to note that this was all one continuous take.\n\nSo many things in this film are worth abusing again and again - Groucho's priceless opening songs, Harpo blowing smoke rings, Chico and Harpo sharking at cards, Abie the Fishman, Hongadonga, Chico's jazzy tune at the piano (while beaming in obvious joy), and Margaret DuMont holding back the laughs. Groucho was hardly ever younger (already older-looking in Horsefeathers, the next feature), the chorus numbers put you right in the orchestra section of the Alvin Theater, and Harpo's scenes with Chico are perfect. Flesh me no flash!\n\nI love this film. And it's all ours now, since 1974.\n\nJ. Steeber NYC",

                "text": "The second Marx Brothers film at Paramount, \"Animal Crackers\" is, in my opinion, far from being their best picture. As great as the Brothers are, they simply cannot save \"Animal Crackers\" from dragging at times. Worse, there is quite a sappy, corny love subplot between Arabella Rittenhouse (Lillian Roth) and John Parker (Hal Thompson), and it becomes most embarrassing during their \"Why Am I So Romantic?\" number. The main plot involves a stolen painting and a couple of cheap replacements, but as critic Leonard Maltin stated, never mind it. And in spite of everything mentioned above, the Marx Brothers indeed receive plenty of opportunities to do their shtick in \"Animal Crackers.\" Just watch Groucho as Captain Spaulding go so far with an ad lib that he trips up his co-stars (especially Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Rittenhouse and Louis Sorin as Roscoe W. Chandler), leaving them powerless to know how to react.\n\nHere are my favorite highlights from \"Animal Crackers\" (and if you haven't seen this film yet, don't read any further). It is always a treat for me to hear Groucho sing, and Capt. Spaulding's opening song \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" is certainly intended to be comical, but it is actually heartwarming and genuine. Capt. Spaulding gives a lecture about Africa, filled with Groucho's trademark quick-witted wordplay, not the least of which is the bit about shooting elephants in pajamas; Signor Emanuel Ravelli (Chico) and the Professor (Harpo) follow his speech with some musical tomfoolery. Signor Ravelli asks the Professor for a flashlight by asking, \"Where's the flash?\"; the Prof keeps pulling other objects whose names begin with \"f\" out of his pockets, and when he finally produces a flashlight and loses it, he has to dig up another flashlight to search for the lost one! Upon the Professor's first entrance (to the tune of \"Collegiate\"), he blows smoke bubbles; after revealing his undergarments, he picks up a rifle and, for no reason at all, starts to shoot (the last thing he shoots is a pair of statues, who suddenly come to life and shoot HIM). Before the card game, the Professor engages in a \"boxing match\" with Mrs. Rittenhouse; we hear the timekeeper's bell and the Prof takes a rest while Ravelli gives him a rubdown and demonstrates some punches and jabs, after which the bell rings again and off the Prof goes to fight again! When Ravelli and the Professor attempt to steal the Beaugard painting, the sounds of thunder are so fake they're laughable! And finally, as the policeman keeps shaking the Professor's hand, hundreds of kitchen knives fall out of the Prof's coat sleeve, topped off with a coffeepot (an ongoing vaudeville routine of Harpo's).\n\nTo sum up, \"Animal Crackers\" is not high on my list of favorite Marx Brothers pictures. But it does have a lot of good moments for the Brothers to shine, and that's ultimately what counts.",

You'll howl as Groucho not only crows about the elephant in his pajamas but a traveling polar bear as well. Harpo manages to steal all of Dumont's silverware and sheds it like raindrops when confronted. Chico confuses Groucho by twisting everything he says, and Dumont keeps her cool even when being insulted.

There are several scenes where it is quite clear that Groucho has gone off the script and is completely throwing the other actors off their game (as is evidence by their barely controlled laughter).  There are scenes where clearly Chico and Harpo are given free-reign and became a disruptive and anarchic force that is endlessly entertaining. \n\n\nOverall, this is certainly not the film to start watching the Marx brothers with, nor is it a particularly good example of their work (start with Day at the Races or Night at the Opera), but for fans the movie is indespensable.

Like so many others, I found the 1933 effort of theirs to be absolutely hilarious! Finally checking out another Marx Brothers comedy about ten months later, \"Animal Crackers\" this time, I knew this one wasn't as popular as \"Duck Soup\", so I wasn't expecting it to be as good, but was still expecting to laugh, which I certainly did. I could almost rate this movie 8/10, and probably would if it wasn't for the fact that towards the end, I was getting a little bored.\n\nWhen Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding returns from Africa, a party is held by Mrs. Rittenhouse on her property, in honour of the explorer. Captain Spaulding, along with the Professor and Signor Emanuel Ravelli, are all lunatics, and with all three of them present at the party, insanity and mayhem are bound to ensue! Mrs. Rittenhouse and others will find that it's not exactly easy with them around. After a painting displayed at the party is stolen, the three are involved in the investigation, but knowing them, this may not help the situation much! \n\nTo make this movie funny, we have the usual chattering from Groucho Marx, playing Captain Spaulding in this film, delivering one silly line after another. I definitely got some good laughs from a number of his jokes, such as his comments on the condition of Mrs. Rittenhouse's estate, his suggestions to Chandler (Louis Sorin) on where to put his opera house, his stories about his African expedition (with a polar bear and such), etc. \"Animal Crackers\" has its share of both verbal and physical humour. The other two Marxes who provide a lot of the laughs are Harpo and Chico, who play the Professor and Signor Emanuel Ravelli, and there are definitely comic highlights in the film thanks to them as well, such as the gag with the fish, flask, flute, etc. Margaret Dumont, known to play the straight woman in a number of Marx Brothers films, plays Mrs. Rittenhouse here, and the faces she sometimes makes in reaction to the Marxes' antics can be amusing. These are all good things, but for me there were downsides, including some tedious music sequences (especially Harpo playing his harp), and I found that the brothers' antics were perhaps getting a bit tiring towards the end, even though I certainly never found that at any point in \"Duck Soup\".\n\nSome people may consider \"Animal Crackers\" the best film from the Marx Brothers, but even though I haven't seen most of their films yet, I can already say I disagree. The only two movies from the comedy team I've seen in recent years are this one and \"Duck Soup\", so I do not yet know how the rest compare, but of the two I've seen, I think the 1933 film is definitely the stronger one. However, that's certainly not to say that this zany comedy from 1930, the second film from the brothers, isn't any good. It's not exactly a continuous rampage like the other Marx Bros. film I've seen, but if you like comic insanity, and don't mind if there isn't much of a plot, this film should do. Just remember that this is also a musical, and if you're not a fan of some of the music here (like me), you could easily find that it gets in the way.",

And we enter the labyrinth of all kinds of plays on words and puns and innuendo, of \"bigamy\" that is \"big of me\", \"Uruguay\" that is \"going your-a-way and me mine\", even the \"small stakes\" of the game of bridge come along with some \"French-fried potatoes\". And do not call three times for \"three cheers\" for anyone at all because the Harpo may bring you three chairs, and you may turn \"colder than a Frigidaire\", and if you have \"quotes, unquotes, quotes,\" in other words three quotes, you just add \"one more and you get a gallon\", though that gallon may come along with \"a moose\", you know this little animal that \"runs around on the floor, eats cheese and is chased by the cat,\" and you may even understand why \"tusks are looser in Alabama\" somewhere on the University of Alabama's campus in Tuscaloosa, which is another story. If finally you ask your own brother to provide you with \"a parachute,\" he will probably abide by your wish if he knows \"the parachute won't open,\" and you should think your wish over and check if you have a \"pair of shoes\" instead. At least these do not need to open for you to be able to walk. And the depression is completely contained in this motto: \"One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime.\" And that is so because with what we today call inflation \"a nickel is no longer what it used to be ten years ago,\" and even \"fifteen years ago,\" to the point of the obligation we find ourselves in to invent the seven-cent nickel and even later an eight-cent nickel, which would enable a well husbanded family to buy a three cent newspaper with that eight-cent nickel and yet get the good old nickel back again to be used over and over again and again in a three-penny store, a way to rewrite the three-penny opera of some English tradition that had been revived in 1928 by Bertold Brecht in Germany. Brilliant. And at least some kind of rejuvenation for the nickel that has been in use unchanged for at least \"one hundred years, since 1492\" And the physical antics are just as crazy, repetitive and luminously hilarious as well as benightedly exhilarating.

And, the brothers weren't quite as relaxed in front of the camera as they would become later. Here in their second film it still is a bit stagy but this is NOT a bad thing necessarily. Sure, the entire film is set in just a few rooms in a mansion BUT I also liked how the film kept its many references to the fact that is IS a play. This sort of self-parody was quite welcome.

It was not perfect, but was a major step in the right direction.\n\nThe film begins with a song and dance number \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\".

For no reason in particular, Chico and Harpo show up and behave like the usual riff-raff that they are--and no one seemed to take all that much notice of their shenanigans--especially when the valuable painting disappears! None of this plot particularly makes sense--meaning, it is prime Marx Brothers entertainment--zany and silly throughout. This makes it a lot like some of their best and earliest films like \"Horse Feathers\" and \"Monkey Business\"--though not quite up to the standards of either film (particularly \"Horse Feathers\", which in my opinion is their best and most underrated film). Again, it isn't quite as good mostly due to sound issues--not the humor itself--as there are plenty of laughs as well as many jokes that fall very flat. But, because they come so rapid-fire you aren't waiting long for a good one to land.",

The other party extra is a painting called After the Hunt, which will be on display. This canvas was done by a famous artist and is worth $100,000. Also showing up at the party will be the music provider (Chico Marx) and a professor (Harpo Marx). A couple of party goers decide to steal the original painting and substitute their own copies, one to play a big joke and the other to get noticed by the art world. Naturally, all three paintings come up missing and a search through the house is on, with the Marx men aiding the hunt. Or are they? This is a darling, darling movie from a different era. Groucho is the king of the one-liners and the shifting eyes. At one point, during his talk, the topic turns to the elephants tusks and how they wouldn't \"come off\" but the \"tusks are loosa in Alabama\". He also says he would give Chico a parachute if it did not open but Chico responds that he already has a \"pair of shoes\". Chico and Harpo also excel at merriment and show off their wonderful musical abilities, Chico on the piano and Harpo with his harp. You might have to view the movie several times to catch all of the rapid fire jokes but that won't be a problem.

I also don't think people understand there are both \"light\" and \"heavy\" Marx Bros. films.\n\n\"Cocoanuts\" is a light film. It has a deliberately silly and transparent plot, a perfect vehicle for showcasing the genius of the brothers for the first time. On the surface AC may seem the same--silly romantic plot, funny musical numbers, the Marxes vs. high society--but it's not. This film (or play) is not a showcase for the Marxes other than for their ability to stay relatively close to the script and bring to full flower playwright George S. Kaufman's caustic vision of the rich idiots on Long Island, their pretentious parties, and all the childish \"games\" they play.\n\nThe plot isn't superfluous. It's all connected to this. Margaret Dumont's Mrs. Rittenhouse is ten times as complex as Mrs. Potter from Cocoanuts. Both naive and phony, her attraction to Captain Spaulding (Groucho) is played on by him to woo then abuse her--not merely insult, abuse.\n\nChico and Harpo are unusually unlikable. Even Zeppo, as Spaulding's arrogant secretary, is a jerk. Groucho has been placed in no incongruous position of power as in Duck Soup. He's just a hanger-on and a leech.\n\nThat's what's always made this film more difficult. There is no one to like, not even the Marxes. But that's the point. If you think of this as \"the movie with Hooray for Captain Spaulding in it,\" you'll watch that and become bored. If you realize this is the Marx Brothers playing it deep (satirically, hysterically, wackily deep, but deep, nonetheless), you won't have a \"feelgood\" reaction at the end as you do for Duck Soup or other films, but you'll appreciate how great it is.\n\nIt is on a level with Duck Soup. They are the two \"message\" films that conceal method in the madness, producing something richer than any of the brothers frothier films.\n\n10 out of 10",

I really preferred \"At The Circus\" to this, as well; an underrated film that, where this is overrated.\n\n\n\"Animal Crackers\" disappointed me, on a first viewing over a year ago, and watching it again last night, the same reservations applied. It seems to me the Marxes are still in the process of honing their stage act to the silver screen, and are only part way there at best. It all seems quite as if they have yet to become fully at ease with the cameras, and angles of film. It is delivered merely as a stage play, with many Groucho asides adding to this effect. There is not the more effective, nuanced direction of the Brothers' antics and characters as in say, the three films following this, particularly \"Duck Soup\".\n\nThe background plot is, as ever in the Marx Brothers farces, cardboard of texture, with Zeppo blending into that and Margaret Dumont providing a superb foil for the Brothers, and Groucho in particular, of course. I suppose you could say Kitty Carlisle gives slightly more zest than you'd expect of a background ingenue in a Marx Brothers film. Yet, her song is, well, a little cringe-worthy and out of place in its doe-eyed vapidity. The background characters are all there to provide foils and authority figures; and indeed, love interests to occupy the indifferent Zeppo.\n\n\nI really don't like the sets and general production values here; they seem cheaper by far than in the three successive Paramount vehicles for the Brothers. The musical routines are not the best; Chico's is passable, but Harpo's is one of his duller harp numbers... and I do love that instrument. The Brothers are on fair form, but are certainly not at their best; Groucho doesn't quite time his quick-fire jibes to the tee we are used to, often coming across as long-winded and firing off too many similar japes in succession. However, there are *some* great one-liners; but I'd make the point that he's not at his best. Chico is okay; his best film from those I have seen, is \"Duck Soup\" where his brand of wily, hapless idiocy is best used. Harpo is most impressive here; his entrance as \"The Professor\" is one of the film's few really hilarious moments, and he has some fine pantomime. Again, he was to do better stuff in subsequent films though. The card game, I suppose, is deftly done.\n\nOverall, a below-par film; the Marx Brothers were not yet properly adjusted to cinema as a medium. Some good stuff, but too many misfires... not the best vehicle overall, but watchable fare.\n\nRating:- ***/*****",

I also love Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Keaton, and other comedians of the silent and early-talkies era.  However, something about the Marx Bros.

Is he trying to impress us with how many jabs he can fit into 10 seconds or trying to make us laugh? I\ncan see how Alan Alda's Mash (which I also found irritating) was greatly indebted to Groucho.\n\nHarpo had funny moments, usually when he acted calm.  But I typically found him to be just plain weird and unsettling.  Okay...he's running around chasing girls with a crazed look on his face while honking a horn...yeah. Gee, I guess you just had to be there.  I kept thinking he needed to be locked up, especially after he started shooting at everyone for no apparent reason.  The other two brothers weren't as annoying, thankfully.\n\nI think that one big difference between Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd vs. the Marx Bros. is that the former are doing *situation comedy* with relatively normal people in strange situations, while the Marx Bros. feature relatively strange people in normal situations.  And perhaps the strange behavior that people find funny is more era-dependent.  I wonder if that's why Chaplin films have held up so much better over time for most people than say Jerry Lewis films.  I don't know.  Certainly Lewis and Marx Bros. films have their share of physical comedy, so that's not the difference.\n\n\nWell at least I can conclude that the Marx Bros. aren't for everyone.\n",

Old man Conway wants to marry Jane himself, and is willing to pay Jane's father a large sum in addition to writing off his debts.\n\nYou know, the longer this went on the less sense it made to me.

It feels totally unnatural, and you wonder why the players and director didn't 'get' it in terms of being realistic.\n\nSo on that score, the best acting award for the flick goes to Starlight the horse, with young Sally Wilson coming up second since she was young enough not to be confused by everyone else around her. As for the checkered scarf gimmick, I kept wondering why it would have been impossible for anyone else to have one, seeing as how it was positioned as the defining characteristic of the Apache Kid. Any other time I would have said you can't make this stuff up, but here quite obviously, they did.",

Made at a time when stage actors and elocutionists were taking over Hollywood - let's just say that when the cowboys talk, you can understand every word they say - they know how to E N U N C I A T E!!! The narrative does not flow smoothly and there are even titles linking the scenes (a hold over from the silent period).\n\nThe Apache Kid (Jack Perrin) is a former outlaw trying to go straight. When his friend, Gus, impersonates him and holds up a mail stage, the Kid finds a letter to himself from his sister, saying his mother is very sick and they won't accept anymore money from him unless it is \"honestly\" come by. \n\nIn the next scene that is completely forgotten about and the story unfolds concerning one of the hands, Ted, from the ranch the Kid has a job on. Ted is in love with Jane (Josephine Hill, Jack Perrin's real life wife), but he has just found out he is a foundling. In desperation he impersonates the Apache Kid and is jailed for robbing a stage. To give Ted an alibi, the Apache Kid puts on his disguise one last time.\n\nThe acting is very wooden with the emphasis being on enunciation rather than action. Jack Perrin was definitely a second stringer from the silent era - who, even in this 1930 film, wasn't comfortable with dialogue.\n\nThere are a couple of exciting stunts - at the beginning the Kid gallops his horse over a cliff and into a river to avoid being captured, and there is also an exciting fight that starts on a railway track (complete with an oncoming train) then finishes on a cliff edge where only one person walks away. \n\nThe real star is \"Starlight\", a beautiful palomino who is called on to speed up the film with some fancy tricks.",

Except for the dance numbers and a couple of MOS sequence, almost everything is done in medium shots, usually extended two-shots.

Several very funny songs include \"Jump In - The Water's Fine\", \"You're Responsible\" (with terrific tap dancing reprise) and \"Tanned Legs\" itself with howling risqu\u00e9 exposure of many tanned legs and what is at the top of them. Arthur Lake in particular is a standout, he was about 24 at the time and is like a lovesick tousled tom cat, especially in his striped dressing gown on the porch. Very modern in tone and style and an utter delight TANNED LEGS is THE BOYFRIEND for real. The film veers off into some melodrama later and ends abruptly which might explain why there is an original running time 5 minutes more than this print of 66 minutes. It seems to have the end missing, which given the way the film starts, should also end with a musical number. However, for the 66 minutes I lapped up it was flapper and swimming cossie heaven. Sally Blaine, who was Loretta Young's sister is astonishingly as beautiful. The film is so early in the talkie era that it is clear the camera is trapped in a glass booth and you can hear the camera whirring. TANNED LEGS is simply gorgeous for every artistic musical and technical reason imaginable. I can't stop watching it. The film is similar to FOLLOW THRU made at Paramount and in color in 1930... and TANNED LEGS clearly needed Jack Haley as well.. there is even one comedian who is similar and only serves to remind us of him. The sound is excellent - photo-phone on film - and serves to explain why it instantly became the industry standard. TANNED LEGS is a complete delight even if the print is incomplete.",

                "text": "This originally started life as a straight comedy but when RKO studio heads heard about the popularity of \"Sunny Side Up\" they decided to stop filming, scrap the cast, all except June Clyde and then add some songs. Clyde was touted by RKO as the \"Luckiest Girl in Hollywood\" and for a short while she was the studio's musical hope but all too soon (by 1931) she was on poverty row. Picked for the role apparently because of her lovely legs, she plays \"little Miss Fix-it\" Peggy Reynolds, embarrassed at her parent's foolish cavortings - her father with flirtatious widow (Dorothy Revier) and her mother with artist Roger (Allan Kearns). Second billed in the cast was Arthur Lake as Bill, Peggy's irritating sweetie. Originally Joel McCrea was going to get his big break but he was dropped in favour of Arthur Lake, surely the whiniest actor of that or any other time (he found his dream role almost a decade later as Dagwood). He was really persevered with by the various studios, why? who knows - it may have been his family connections.\n\nAll roads lead to the Orphan's Benefit as the film starts with a panning shot of beachside frivolity then goes directly to cute as a button Peggy who sings up a storm with \"Come On In\", a very hummable song with gorgeous Clyde strutting her stuff in bathers and the chorus line enthusiastic as well. Another person who is unhappy about the romantic entanglements is Tootie, Roger's flapper fianc\u00e9e. Ann Pennington is gorgeous, all pep and personality and she informs him of her displeasure in \"You're Responsible\". They both perform a great little song and dance duet which is the highlight of the movie. Kearns, who didn't really have the greatest face for a leading man, had been a star on Broadway specializing in Gershwin productions and went on to have a starring role in \"Girl Crazy\" - he could actually dance and matched Ann step for step!! Shock!! Horror!! - two girls saunter onto the beach in stockings and that is all that is needed for Peggy and Tootie to go into the song and dance \"Tanned Legs\"!!\n\nThere has to be more than just singing and dancing - where's the story!! Enter Sally Blane (originally the part was to be played by Marceline Day) - she plays Janet, Peggy's sister, in love with a ne'er do well who, unknown to everyone at the resort, is in league with the flirtatious widow and between them hoping to get as much as they can from the gullible Reynolds family. Peggy overhears her sister pleading for some incriminating letters and being sneered at for her trouble. Peggy decides to get them herself, she is seen on his balcony and her reputation is in tatters!! - \"turned against by kith and kin\"!! but she finds an unlikely ally who turns out to be the hero of the movie!! Not before a shot rings out and Peggy from her sick bed can give everyone a thorough dressing down worthy of Shirley Temple!!\n\nMarshall Neilan had been a skyrocket, directing some of Mary Pickford's best films and discovering some terrific talent (Sally O'Neill, Wesley Barry) but by 1929 it had all faded in an alcoholic mist. He didn't get congratulations for \"Tanned Legs\", the New York Times critic scolded that the film was \"unimaginatively directed like a senior high school play with sound\"!!\n\nHighly Recommended.",

Clyde must solve everyone's problems by obtaining a blackmailer's love letters...\n\nThis early all-talking musical play lives up to the title \"Tanned Legs\" -- partly.

It's difficult to tell in black and white, but the gams do not look especially tanned. Direction is otherwise not notable. As the portly father and matronly mother, Albert Gran and Nella Walker are perhaps most memorable. Broadway favorites Allen Kearns and Ann Pennington give it some authentic musical appeal.

                "text": "\nActually only the first few minutes are set in Madrid - the rest is in Santiago!\n\nWatching this early talkie makes me wonder why audiences didn't storm the studios demanding a return to silents.  The actors, and the camera, that had once been so free, were now reduced to almost complete immobility.  Actors like Novarro, possessed of strong physical abilities, were forced to stand around chatting endlessly in living rooms.  Were audiences so captivated by any talking that they didn't notice how poorly written the dialogue was?  Only a year earlier they could see Novarro frolicking through coconut groves and swimming the South Seas in \"The Pagan\" or in a spectacular storm at sea in \"Across to Singapore\".  No such action here - such were the restrictions of early sound recording.  No wonder so many people thought talkies were just a fad.\n\nDespite all this Novarro is remarkably good, particularly in the charming and funny scene when he seduces the heroine.  His singing is also impressive - we often forget what a great singer this \"silent\" star was.  Everyone else looks lost as they struggle with the dialogue and try to make sense of the shallow and dull plot.  And why is it that Novarro is the only character in this Spanish setting with a Spanish accent?  Even his father speaks like an Oxford don.\n\nIt makes you wonder if MGM was trying to destroy Novarro in the same way they did John Gilbert.  It's hard to believe that the excellent Robert Z. Leonard directed this.\n\nOne point of interest is the relationship between Novarro's character, Ricardo, and the heroine's brother Ernesto.  David Scott, although a very poor actor, certainly plays Ernesto as having a crush on Ricardo.  Given the beauty of both men, and what we now know of Novarro's own sexuality, it is possible that there was more sub-text going on here than the writers intended!",

After his great success with THE PAGAN & DEVIL-MAY-CARE (both 1929), this had to have been quite a\ndisappointment. With his pleasant accent & fine singing voice, Novarro had already proved that talking pictures would be no problem for him - if given the right roles.\n\nBut Hollywood was about to go out of the Latin Lover movie business. With new stars like Robert Montgomery & Clark Gable soon to ascend, male masculinity would be the vogue and gender ambiguity - represented by Novarro, Billy Haines & Nils Asther - would not only no longer be in fashion, but could be viewed as rather dangerous by the Studio front offices.\n\nStarting with IN GAY MADRID, Novarro would enter a bumpy flight of highs & lows in the films he would be assigned, ending with a crash landing in THE NIGHT IS YOUNG (1934). He would play the parts well, in a kaleidoscope of ethnic disguises, but ultimately his MGM stardom was doomed.\n\nIn MADRID, Novarro once again plays a school boy, a part for which he was about a dozen years too old. The love story is pure soap opera and not very compelling. Novarro's fellow students, strangely all male, have the distressing habit of frequently breaking into rousing campus choruses, sounding rather too much like Wiffenpoof wannabes. Novarro is the only member of the cast who seems to care about exhibiting even a\nscintilla of Spanish sensibility.\n\nNovarro is reunited with lovely Dorothy Jordan, his costar in DEVIL-MAY-CARE, but she is essentially given mostly silly se\u00f1orita dialogue and so becomes tedious quite quickly. Plump little Beryl Mercer provides some moments of sly fun as Miss Jordan's maiden aunt.\n\nNovarro's natural charm gets to slip out at times. His songs, especially the serenaded ballads, are very enjoyable (Xavier Cugat was responsible for some of the music). And in the scene in which he tries to regale his father with details of an imaginary taxi accident, Novarro is very funny. Too bad the rest of the film kept tripping him up...\n",

Dick Dewy (John Batten) is the son of a tranter and violinist in the village Quire, with some aspirations to succeed in life further than his father and grandfather. Of course he falls for Fancy at first sight, starting a rivalry with rich landowner Shinar (Nigel Barrie), who overacts somewhat, twirling his moustache while plotting his rival's downfall.\n\nIs the film any good? It's not bad for an early sound film but suffers from the limitations of filming available in dialogue scenes; however, the photography by Claude Friese-Greene is beautiful and the music in the film (apart from the ghastly quartet singing the farmyard song) is very well done.

                "text": "That's mainly because the supporting cast consists of Lew Cody and Natalie Moorhead who comprise the semi-suitors to the feuding leading couple Helen and George Morris, played by Irene Delroy and James Hall. The two leads didn't have careers past the early sound era, and it is probably what caused many a short career during this time. Both had very good voices and looks, but their acting is very wooden. Lew Cody plays Paul, a chronically drunk but tunefully talented friend of the couple and apparently a former beau of Helen who would like to reinterview for that position. Natalie Moorhead plays a femme fatale who meets George Morris at exactly the wrong time and pilfers - with George's complicity - a gift Helen has just given George that morning. He flirts shamelessly with her, thinking he'll never see her again, but boy is he wrong.\n\nAlso note that the film seems to be going for an MGM kind of upper crust drawing room style of the period, yet it cannot shake the Warner Brothers working class style. For example, George and Helen are apparently quite wealthy, living in a multi-wing mansion with a maid and a butler. George goes to the athletic club - and the fights. George and Helen should think about replacing their current servants, though, because in spite of their presence, it is apparently Helen that does the cooking and the cleaning. Since George and Helen are very young - obviously in their 20's - you'd assume that all of this money is the result of inherited wealth. However, all during their film there is not one mention of a relative. There is some invasion of life in 1930 into this little comedy though. Paul (Lew Cody) is called a \"rotter\", a reference to the rot-gut liquor of prohibition. Note that prohibition has not slowed down Paul's - or anyone else's - consumption of alcohol. \n\nThis film is actually a pretty good early talkie because the tranquilized performances of the leading actors are compensated for not only by the supporting performers but by the cute gags and turns in the plot of the film itself. Especially humorous is Cody's character backscoring George's excuses to Helen with appropriate piano accompaniment. I'd say give it a try if it ever crosses your path and early talkies are of interest to you. I found it quite amusing.",

                "text": "Disney's \"Silly Symphony\" series was an important training-ground for animators to sharpen their skills and experiment with difficult visual effects, such as rainstorms and water reflections. 'Springtime (1929)' was directed by Walt Disney himself, and, though it is a primitive short films by most standards, one can nonetheless recognise the development of important techniques and ideas that would later be relied upon for subsequent masterpieces, such as Burt Gillet's 'Flowers and Trees (1932),' Wilfred Jackson's 'The Old Mill (1937)' and, most significantly of all, Disney's feature-length magnum opus, 'Fantasia (1940).' Animated in black-and-white, of course, 'Springtime' celebrates the arrival of spring in a secluded wetland, where anthropomorphised insects, frogs and birds commemorate the new season by dancing joyously in time to music, and generally eating their way down the food-chain. Flowers rise from the soil to perform a quick-step on two legs, while trees melodiously wave their arm-like branches.\n\n'Springtime' was the first in a series of four Disney cartoons, each instalment celebrating a particular season. Spring is traditionally all about growth and new life, and the sheer exuberance of the forest creatures is skillfully translated to the screen. Bird chicks are born in their nests, one after the other, and everybody appears to be having a rather entertaining time. I find it interesting how the theme of death is incorporated so lightly into such an upbeat musical cartoon, with almost every character falling victim to a predator almost immediately after we have watched their performance: the caterpillar in sequentially gobbled up by the raven, the grasshoppers are devoured by the frog, the frogs provide a hearty meal for the stork, and, for the finale, the stork is swallowed up by an unexpectedly deep puddle. Though the lightning effects are admittedly rather primitive, the raindrops are animated very well, and Disney would only get better at it.",

The Disney artists seem to have an unending supply of posterior gags, often rather vulgar. The tuneful soundtrack with its familiar themes pushes the action along - most notably Ponchielli's `Dance of the Hours,' which would be showcased to great effect eleven years later in the Studio's FANTASIA.\n\nThe SILLY SYMPHONIES, which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929, are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation. Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount, with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music. There was little plot in the early Symphonies, which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals, all moving frantically to the soundtrack. Gradually, however, the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot, characterization & photographic special effects. The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale, Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed. It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring. In 1939, with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon, Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES; they had run their course & served their purpose.",

It's not very fun, it doesn't have any real charm that I could see, and I know it was only the third ever Silly Symphony to be put out and it was all still very much a work in progress as far as the quality and very art of the animation was concerned, but the sound is just awful. As the creatures dance around there is so much tinny klop klop klopping noise that just to me sounded horribly cheap and brutal, like someone is tapping a pan with a teaspoon, it just doesn't sound good at all. I also don't like the more weird unnatural touches like when the caterpillar separates its body segments and the stretchy limbs of the bird, that kinda thing is much more Fleischer than Disney. And I know it was perfectly mild but I really didn't like the animals eating each other, and it wasn't like they all come back alive and well at the end either. I mean I get that in their own way the animators were probably trying to show what really happens in nature from the animals that they doubtlessly observed, but I didn't like that! Thank goodness it didn't become a regular thing! I didn't mean for this to be so negative but I'm only being honest. In fact I've been getting back into these shorts a lot lately, but this is as poor a short as I remembered it, I'd rank it among the series' worst. Most of what is in it was later done again more effectively in later Symphonies like \"Flowers and Trees\", and even the 1930 \"Summer\" short. And much like Summer it feels more like a depiction of the animal life of a swamp environment than anything to do with Spring, apart from the opening flowers and hatching chicks at the beginning. It's not even remotely a good tribute to the first season. So to me at least the third time is not always the charm. Oh well, it's still a part of the rich evolving tapestry of a series that had far greater animated wonders yet to come... Not their best!",

Pay attention, and don't make me go through this again...\n\nFifi Sands is trapped in a loveless marriage. The only two people she cares about are her teenage son Alan and her lover Owen McDonald. As the contrived plot begins to creak into life, Fifi's husband John has finally consented to give Fifi a divorce, and at last she looks forward to happiness with Owen and her son. She goes off to celebrate at a posh dinner party, only to be notified by Alan that John Sands has been murdered. And Owen is the leading suspect. Despite the antipathy between Fifi and John, their son Alan loved both parents. Now he believes that his mother conspired with Owen to murder John Sands.\n\nSPOILERS COMING, BUT SO WHAT? Hoping to intercede on Owen's behalf, Fifi visits attorney Bedlow in his penthouse. (Never trust an attorney named Bedlow, especially if he lives in a penthouse.) Now get this. It turns out that Bedlow (played by HB Warner) is the real killer. He murdered Fifi's husband and framed her lover. Why? Because Bedlow wants Fifi for himself! This is ludicrous on the face of it, but made more so because in this movie (and several others) HB Warner utterly fails to convince me that he has any interest in women.\n\nThe establishing shots and dialogue for the climactic confrontation between Fifi and Bedlow take pains to emphasise the high altitude of his penthouse, so I was certain that one or the other character -- likely Bedlow -- would go crashing through one of the windows in a death-plunge, either accidentally or pushed. I was half right: Bedlow goes out the window, right enough, but he deliberately jumps when Fifi spurns him.\n\nOh, I forgot to tell you about the crazy sister locked in the garret, apparently left over from 'Jane Eyre'. Forget it. You don't want to know. IMDb have got this film listed as a 'mystery', but it's really more of a melodrama. The solution to the murder of John Sands comes out of nowhere, and the killer's motive is implausible. The main characters in this movie are allegedly quite posh, but the sets and costumes look distinctly downmarket.\n\nWhen the opening credits revealed that this movie is based on a play by Zoe Akins, I cringed. Akins was quite popular in her day, but her dramas are overwrought and bathetic, and I'm not aware that any of them have ever been revived: they're certainly very outdated. Normally, if I've viewed an incomplete or a deteriorated print of a film, I shan't rate it ... in case the unviewable portions of the film contained some unknown pleasures that would have enhanced the film's overall rating. In this case, although I've only seen and heard bits and bobs of 'The Furies', I'm confident that the entire film is rubbish. I rate this movie zero points.

                "text": "What a treat! Early talkie musical starring Broadway and Vaudeville stars, the Duncan Sisters. They sang, danced, and did comedy. This film is sort of a knock-off of THE Broadway MELODY. The Duncan Sisters were wanted for that film but were on the road, so the producers copied them in hiring Bessie Love and Anita Page. Later that year MGM snagged the Duncan Sisters for this film.\n\nThey play sisters who work in a department store along with handsome Jimmy (Lawrence Gray). When smart-alec Casey (Rosetta Duncan) gets fired, they all quit and launch a career in \"the show business.\" Jimmy is sweet on Babe (Vivian Duncan) which infuriates Casey.\n\nAnyway, they form an act built around Jimmy's songs. He plays piano while the girls sing and dance. They are a hit, but there is constant friction between Casey and Jimmy. The couple gets married and Casey goes berserk, breaking up the act. Casey goes solo, while the couple tries to make it alone. They all flop. Some time after, Babe gets really sick and Jimmy is forced to track down Casey and bring her back home.\n\nWhile the plot is creaky and the acting is not always very good, the musical numbers are vintage gold. \"I'm Following You,\" which was a big hit, is sung several times. There is also a great comic version of \"Tell Me Pretty Maiden,\" which was the theme song of FLORODORA GIRL, the terrific Marion Davies film which also starred Lawrence Gray. \"The Hoosier Hop\" is also solid and done in 2-strip Technicolor. Another color sequence is a fashion parade that goes comically wrong.\n\nGray is charming and handsome and it's hard to figure why he wasn't a bigger success in talkies. He also has a great singing voice. Benny Rubin and Jed Prouty co-star.\n\nOf the sisters: Rosetta is the shorter one and the broad comic. She kept reminding me of Patsy Kelly and Beryl Mercer. Vivian was \"the pretty one\" and has an OK soprano voice. They duet on several songs and are quite effective. They both are passable dancers and comics. They were big stage stars but didn't do all that well in films. Their only other feature together was TOPSY AND EVA, based on their smash hit stage musical. They also did a few shorts.\n\nI liked them and thought they were both talented and personable. Maybe they could have found a niche in films. Rosetta was on the verge of a comeback on TV (WILD BILL HICKCOK) when she was killed in a car accident. Vivian apparently retired and lived to be 90.\n\nIT'S A GREAT LIFE is creaky and stagy but what a treat to see these big stars on film.",

                "text": "A sister act finds IT'S A GREAT LIFE in show business as long as they can stick together.\n\nMGM crafted this confection as a showcase for the talents of the Duncan Sisters, of Vaudeville & Broadway fame, and as such it's an interesting relic of its era. The sound quality is remarkably good, considering its age, one of the songs is quite good, and the antique color, which highlights a couple of stage sequences, is very pleasing to the eye. As a vehicle for screen stardom, however, the film proved a disappointment. The Sisters' movie career was over almost before if could get started.\n\nRosetta (1900-1959) and Vivian (1902-1986) do quite well as siblings who rise from performing in retail follies to the Vaudeville stage. Vivian, the pretty one, gets most of the film's few romantic moments, but Rosetta, who was an true clown able to do hilarious things with her face & body, steals the picture. When allowed to be silly she is enormous fun to watch. The script, unfortunately, keeps her character in a bad temper for much of the time, eventually wearying the viewer with her interminable fuming. She's so much more enjoyable when in a jolly mood, especially when teamed with sister Vivian. Their lovely duet, \"I'm Following You,\" is a genuine heartwarmer.\n\nLawrence Gray, who had made a name for himself in comic Silent film roles, makes the most of his somewhat thankless part as the piano player who captures Vivian's heart. Jed Prouty, as the department store manager who quietly loves Rosetta, and Benny Rubin, playing a Vaudeville booking agent, both do well with their small roles.\n\nThe opening scene, with the Sisters madly dashing down the street to work, hotly pursued by a cop and a mob of excited New Yorkers, is one of the movie's best and gets the proceedings off to a frenzied start.",

                "text": "IT'S A GREAT LIFE (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1929) directed by Sam Wood, is another one of those \"Broadway Melody\" variations produced during the early sound era, with the plot revolving around the up and down stage career of two singing sisters and a songwriter, in this instance, piano playing composer. What makes this one more natural to MGM's own Academy Award Best Picture winner of \"The Broadway Melody\" (1929), which starred Bessie Love, Anita Page and Charles King, is that this one features actual sisters in the leads. The sisters in question are The Duncan Sisters. And who are the Duncan Sisters? No, they are not the originators of the franchise of Duncan Donuts. Both blondes, they were popular vaudeville headliners with one previous feature film to their name, the silent production of TOPSY AND EVA (UA, 1927). As a result from viewing IT'S A GREAT LIFE, Rosetta (1886-1959) is best described as the shortest of the two with a flare for comedy in the manner of Winnie Lightner with a sort of raspy voice; Vivian (1899-1986), slightly taller yet prettier, sings and dances, but lacking in acting ability, especially when it comes to heavy dramatics. As with many big names during this period, the Duncan Sisters are virtually forgotten today. It's interesting to point out on how Vivian closely resembles Anita Page at one point with a cross variation to future screen actress Dorothy McGuire. Had IT'S A GREAT LIFE been distributed earlier in 1929 instead of the tail end or early 1930, it might have become an equivalent to \"The Broadway Melody,\" considering how both films are somewhat similar in theme, which makes one wonder if the writers of \"The Broadway Melody\" story had the Duncan Sisters in mind. Regardless, there were no further Duncan Sisters musicals to follow, indicating that IT'S A GREAT LIFE left little or no lasting impression to 1929 audiences. By the time of its release, musicals were showing signs of decline, thus making their talking debut the final feature film for the Duncans.\n\nSynopsis in brief: Set in New York City, the story opens with a chase after two girls are seen running from their apartment building, down the street, and immediately being pursued by a policeman and some passersby, causing some traffic accidents as the girls cross through heavy traffic, ending with them heading into a department store where it is soon revealed that they are late for work. The plot development introduces the Hogan sisters, Casey (Rosetta) as the wisecracking elder sister to Babe (Rosetta). Babe loves Jimmy Dean (Lawrence Gray), with whom she works in the sheet music department. For some reason, Rosetta dislikes Jimmy, which is never revealed why. She always finding fault in him and takes every opportunity to criticize him whenever possible in hope that Babe will become discouraged and forget about him. After getting fired from their jobs following the annual store show by Mr. Mandelbaum for his disapproval of Casey's clowning, the trio make a go for the big time in vaudeville. Although they become successful, things become complicated when Babe marries Jimmy, causing problems in her relationship with Casey, thus breaking up the act. While failures on their own, they all become too stubborn to make the first move and admit their faults, even when one of them becomes seriously ill with pneumonia.\n\nThe musical program: \"Smile, Smile, Smile\" (sung by employees); \"What the Debutante Must Do\" (fashion show sequence in two strip Technicolor), \"I'm a Son of a ---.\" \"Lady Love\" (sung by Vivian Duncan); \"I'm Following You\" (sung by the Duncan Sisters); \"Smile, Smile, Smile,\" \"I'm Following You,\" \"It Must Be an Old Spanish Custom,\" \"Rigoletto,\" \"It Must as Well Be You,\" \"Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella\" (sung by unseen vocalist during dramatic moment); \"I'm Following You\" (sung by Lawrence Gray); \"Dance Number\" (performed by Rosetta dressed up like a little Dutch Boy); \"Hoosier Hop\" (production number in two-strip Technicolor with the Duncan Sisters); and \"I'm Following You.\" With the songs being the main attraction, only \"I'm Following You\" is quite memorable, even after several reprises.\n\nAside from the aforementioned leads, only Benny Rubin as Benny Friedman, the booking agent, and Jed Prouty (who played the stuttering uncle in \"The Broadway Melody\" ) as David Parker, the store manager who loves Casey, assume billing in the opening casting credits while others do not.\n\nThe title to IT'S A GREAT LIFE has been used several times over the years: Paramount (1935) with Joe Morrison; Columbia (1943), as part of the 28 film series featuring \"Blondie and the Bumsteads\" with Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake, as well as the long forgotten TV comedy series starring Michael O'Shea and Frances Bavier (1953-55).\n\nThe movie as a whole is really not bad. After it is all over, it'll be hard to get these lyrics, \"Wherever you go, whatever you do, I want you to know, I'm following you\" out of your head. IT'S A GREAT LIFE may never be categorized as a great early musical, but mostly a curiosity for fans of movies from this particular era as well as a rediscovery look into the careers of the once popular Duncan Sisters. Only the final minutes, highlighted by a Technicolor production number choreographed by Sammy Lee, comes off a bit weak. \n\nOnce shown on a frequent level on Turner Classic Movies cable channel prior to 1996, it's become more of a rarity today.

Here he is paired with Vivian, the prettier (if less talented) of the Duncan Sisters who turn out to be comedians rather than the single-minded, full-throated singers I always imagined. Rosetta is the real clown of the act, Vivian the straight \"guy\" who also sings a little. While Gray struggles with his role as Vivian's love interest, Rosetta's romantic partner turns out to be Jed Prouty, who is surprisingly effective, considering he made no less than seven other movie appearances in 1929, including his most well-known role as the stuttering uncle in \"Broadway Melody\". There are also some effective cameos from the crowds of extras. The first half of the movie is an unalloyed delight. Director Sam Wood certainly gets things off to a really great start. In fact, I nominate it as the best ever opening sequence for a musical. Better still, this M-G-M production, I'm very happy to say, still has its two Technicolor sequences intact (even in the first is printed a little too dark and the second a little too light in the current DVD).",

                "text": "The Warner Archives got this one right. The last time this film was shown in its entirety on TCM back in the 1990's, the color finale was still lost. After it was found, the restored film was never shown on TCM to my knowledge, but the discovered color finale was often shown on Turner Classic Movies under its \"One Reel Wonder\" series between films. The Warner Archives DVD-R release restores the color finale to the film itself, so we get to see it as it was supposed to be seen and was seen in 1929.\n\nThe story involves sisters Babe and Casey Hogan, (Vivian and Rosetta Duncan), salesgirls at a department store, which is ruled somewhat like a banana republic in that store employees are required to assemble and sing the store song each morning. The girls have been orphaned since Babe was a child, and Casey is the older sister. Thus Casey is accustomed to looking after sister Babe and deflecting the advances of Jimmy Dean (Lawrence Grey), who has a strong romantic interest in younger sister Babe. This was the Duncan Sisters' only sound film, and they come across oddly on camera. Vivien is somewhat like a husky Anita Page, and Rosetta reminds me in voice and actions of Lucille Ball, although Rosetta does not have Lucy's delicacy of features.\n\nPieces of this story looks like it inspired Singing in the Rain. For example, there is a show by and for the department store employees about half way into the film that includes a fashion show. A song is sung by a male tenor as each girl steps down a staircase to present the latest in flapper fashions - much like the Beautiful Girl number in Singin in the Rain. Also, Babe gets deathly ill towards the end of the film and goes unconscious, allowing a couple of over the top musical numbers that are the highlight of the movie - \"The Hoosier Hop\" and the recently found finale \"Sailing on a Sunbeam\". These numbers are supposed to be Babe's hallucinations as she lies unconscious. These numbers rather reminded me of the long \"Broadway Melody\" number in Singin in the Rain, with its wild colors and big sets in that film within a film.\n\nRecommended for those who enjoy the early sound films.",

                "text": "IT'S A GREAT LIFE is a one-of-a-kind comedy-musical-melodrama starring the legendary The Duncan Sisters, one of the few vaudeville headlining acts to be given a chance at major film stardom. MGM appears to have spared no expense at attempting to showcase the Duncans to best advantage and while the end result unfortunately did not result in screen stardom for the gals (the Duncans never again appeared in a feature film although they would make a musical two-reeler and several appearances as themselves in short films over the next decade) they are utterly charming though surely more than a little eccentric to modern viewers. \n\nSisters Casey (Rosetta Duncan) and Babe Hogan (Vivian Duncan) work at a major department store. Babe is sweet on the store's pianist for the sheet music department, James Dean (!!!) (played by Lawrence Gray). For reasons never quite clear, Casey hates him with a passion and constantly makes him the butt of her humor. Ill-humored Casey is a sarcastic cutup and ultimately her mockery of the store's \"theme song\" during a store musical production ends up getting all of the trio fired. Fortunately, a pal of Jimmy's, a talent agent, has seen the act and launches them on a successful career as vaudeville performers but the fighting between Casey and Jimmy only escalates and when Babe and Casey sneak off and get married, an infuriated Casey breaks up the act leading all of them down the path of failure.\n\nRosetta Duncan is a riot as the sassy older sister, she's a fantastic comedienne and her mocking, disrespectful humor seems astonishingly contemporary today even while the movie itself creaks like many early talkies. She also is a delight with a comic song. The talents of the (considerably) prettier Vivian Duncan are more modest although she is an endearing presence and sings lovely harmony with her sister. The sisters, both into their thirties at the time, are quite effective as their \"little girl\" personas in several song numbers as they no doubt were even more so on the stage at the time. \n\nThe movie seems a bit long with it's slender plot and small speaking cast and the turn toward melodrama was at least for modern audiences was a mistake, but the movie has still has much to recommend it with it's vivid glimpse at 1920's New York, a \"flapper\" fashion show, appealing two-strip Technicolor sequences, quite good songs and numbers and above all the two and only Duncan Sisters. As Babe Hogan would put it, this movie is quite \"sweet\".",

                "text": "I first heard about this film aback in the lat 70's when i check out a book ,\" the m.g.m. story. It was a huge book. I saw years and years later a bad faded version. That had 4 early Technicolor sequences . One I would learn later was not a part of the film .It was from lost film ,\"Red hot rhythm. with Alan hale s.r. doing a song and dance number. This was a version of the movie that was privately owned by Rosetta Duncan. She obviously knew about nitrate and color fading and preserved it in a cool storage. Thanks to her we got this film. The rogue song was stored carelessly. There's only two clips and a faded trailer.Well I learned in that in the early 90's before t.c.m. tn.t.. had this version on. I used to watch T.n.t, how did I miss it? Well T. c. M. had a version in which the last final of the Technicolor musical sequence was edited out as well as the red hot rhythm. The real disturbing part about the version on t.n.T. was that the finale number of the last color sequence was enhanced . They made the chorus girls feathers colorized to blue making that whole final looking like three strip. Making it uneven. This revisionism against history is wrong. This is typical of big corporate greed fearing that some of the audience won't like two color Technicolor , enhancing this to ensure their greedy ratings will be made.m.g.m .u.a did this against Dr, X. and Mystery of the wax museum by the mid 90's out of fear that some of the audience may not understand two strip. I got the d.v.d. version recently . The first color sequence is original. The first finale stays original.But the last of the finale is that enhanced version. I'm disappointed . They did remove red hot rhythm sequence. That wasn't part of the movie to begin with.They should of removed that blue and it would of looked the way it was suppose to look.the way it was made.But m.g.m side of Time Warner is still anti two color cause of greed.The only reason why they didn't enhanced all the sequences cause it was too expensive .In spite of this fault it's still an entertaining film.Which explores the history of Vaudeville , which was dying when this movie was made,in which too struggling sisters, Babe and Casey Hogan, struggle every day.Casey promising her dying mother that she would take care of her young sister.But babe starts to fall for the piano music sheet man , played by Lawrence Gray. but Casey is over protective of her sister. When there store has their show . Casey thinks that the original way of the act stinks. Since Babe is getting nervous, Casey comes in and makes it better. but James ,played by Lawrence, thinks she ruined the show . But it becomes a hit. But Casey and Babe and James are fired. But are rescued by Benny Ruben as the talent manager, puts them on the stage. They are a hit . But James and Casey can't get along.This causes the act too break up and Casey is mad at Babe for marrying James.without all three the individual performers flop.It's when babes get's sick that this united all three. I have gotten a feeling that the original plans for this picture was going to be all Technicolor. But since the Duncan sister weren't known in films and Mayors attitude for color. It was decided just to have 3 sequences only. Lawrence Tibbet was a bigger name than them on the screen. i'm just guessing it. It's still collectible .

The film is worthy of rediscovery for several reasons, including:\n\nA) It has a great cast...one of the best of any film released in 1930;\n\nB) The film was directed by Rupert (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) Julian;\n\nC) It could be considered the first Universal sound horror film, predating DRACULA by 3 months;\n\nD) Cast members Lilyan Tashman and Blanche Friderici co-starred the following year in a wonderful mystery-horror film, MURDER BY THE CLOCK;\n\nE) Star Helen Twelvetrees was a popular early talkie actress...she, along with Constance Bennett, Nancy Carroll, Mae Clarke, Ann Harding,  Billie Dove, et al,  typified the early sound era;\n\n\nI hope this title is rediscovered.

                "text": "\"The Cat Creeps\" is the last film directed by Rupert Julian, whose single best-known credit is the silent version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", starring Lon Chaney. But Chaney and Julian quarrelled bitterly during production of that film: Julian was ultimately dismissed from the set, and Chaney took over the direction himself (with an uncredited assist by Edward Sutherland). So, Julian's reputation is based on a film which he largely didn't direct. \"The Cat Creeps\" is probably a better indication of his talents, which weren't much.\n\n\"The Cat and the Canary\" was a spooky-old-house stage play by John Willard, which was filmed several times. The two most notable versions are Paul Leni's 1927 moody silent film and the 1939 remake which played up the comedy relief and made a star of Bob Hope. \"The Cat Creeps\" is the first talkie version, made only three years after Leni's silent, and probably retitled so as to avoid comparisons.\n\nIt's a poor film. Many early sound-era films were much more ponderous than late silent films, due to the heavy sound-recording equipment and the bulky mufflers (called \"blimps\") that were needed to soundproof the cameras. Even by early talkie standards, \"The Cat Creeps\" is a VERY slow film, in every way inferior to the 1927 and 1939 versions.\n\nThe film sticks very close to Willard's play and the Leni version. Ten years after a miser's death, his relatives meet in his creepy old house for the reading of the will. (Isn't it actually illegal to delay the reading of a will this long?) The terms of the will are read out by Lawyer Crosby: the other characters keep calling him \"Lawyer Crosby\", as if that's his name. Annabelle West (Helen Twelvetrees) stands to inherit the lot, unless she conveniently goes insane (from, let's say, terror .. or maybe boredom) before she leaves the old house. If Annabelle goes bonkers, then all the lovely lolly goes to... suddenly the lights go out! When they go on again, Lawyer Crosby has vanished into thin heir.\n\nOh, yeah, I forgot. There's a homicidal maniac loose on the premises. (No home should be without one.) He's known only as the Cat, but evidence indicates that the Cat is also one of the disinherited relatives ... who might just inherit after all if Annabelle is driven insane. (Why doesn't he just kill her?) Meanwhile, Lawyer Crosby's corpse falls out of the cupboard. Where's the will? Stodgy Neil Hamilton, warming up (or cooling off) for his future role as Commissioner Gordon in the \"Batman\" TV series, flusters his way through his role here as Annabelle's handsome protector ... or could he possibly be the evil Cat?\n\n\"The Cat Creeps\" was made during Universal Studios' great period of horror films, so it's disappointing that this movie delivers so little \"boo!\" for the buck. Helen Twelvetrees displays so little screen presence, she ought to be pruned down to Helen Threetrees. As for her acting ability ... well, she's pretty to look at, but that's all. If you've seen another version of \"The Cat and the Canary\", you know how this version ends. In fact, this version offers nothing that isn't done better in the '27 or '39 version, or both. Skip this unnecessary remake. It's alleged \"historic\" significance is negligible.",

It really is almost plot less with little vignettes of new recruits lives at the naval academy. It was really cool to see John Wayne and Ward Bond in the earliest speaking roles I have seen, but they really weren't actors then and their line readings are so stilted, but not just those two everybody talks bizarrely. Not to mention Stepin Fetchit who has to be the most bizarre character I've ever seen.\n\nI mean there is the whole setup of these to brothers being in the military, but all that ever happens is that they play football.\n\nSomehow this movie felt like it was a home movie that was released accidentally, I really can't see John Ford directing John Wayne to throw a pie at someone's face.\n\nMy conclusion is that John Ford and the crew must have gotten drunk, Ford passed out they kept the cameras rolling, all of the actors filmed their improvisations, then Ford woke up and edited together in something that might vaguely resemble a movie.\n\nI can't rate this because I'm not sure if its a work of genius or the accidental work of a sleeping man., or maybe I was right in the beginning...its all one big practical joke on the audience.",

Best performance in the film is from Frank Albertson as Janney's smart mouth roommate.\n\nIt was interesting to see both Wayne and Bond before either of them was any kind of a name. The integration of newsreel footage of the Army/Navy game was well done by Ford, very similar to how he used newsreel film from Ireland in The Plough And The Stars.

Parthy, irritated over the supposed influence of leading lady Julie (Magnolia's idol and best friend) fires her, despite her husband's objections. Many years later, Magnolia is a young woman and becomes a leading lady. Her leading man is Gaylord Ravenal, a riverboat gambler with whom she falls in love and elopes. But the sudden and unexpected death of Captain Andy forces the couple to leave the boat and move to Chicago rather than endure the disapproving Parthy, and Ravenal's gambling luck soon runs out.

It is certainly not dated, especially with the number of people today who are addicted to gambling, and it stands on its own two feet without the Jerome Kern score. I was pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed TCM's broadcast completely.\n\nFavorite scenes: when little Magnolia is torn from Julie (Alma Rubens, who would be dead from heroin addiction only two years later) by her jealous mother (Emily Fitzroy, with her customary severe hairknot appearance), when Gay and Magnolia first meet on the Showboat (how beautiful those close-ups were!), and the ending, when the elderly Gay falls at Magnolia's feet and the forlorn Lonesome Road is sung in the background. The last scene in particular seemed other-worldly to me, and that was because of the performances of both Laura La Plante and Joseph Schildkraut, which were so solid and touching. \n\nEspecially compared to the later musical versions, which glossed over some of the more difficult aspects of Gay and Magnolia's marriage, 1929's \"Showboat\" has the courage to show the seedier aspects of the downward turn in their relationship due to gambling. The Grayson-Keel musical has their child being born after Gay leaves, with Magnolia never informing Gay she was pregnant. But in the 1929 version Gay is shown to basically abandon both wife and young child, instead of living up to his responsibilities to get a real job to provide for them. We should have less sympathy for such a man, but somehow, we understand and forgive.",

The film began as a silent version of the Ferber novel, was pulled and made a part-talkie with a singing prologue, a ten minute two-scene initial talkie sequence, and an extended, many scene twenty minute plus sequence later in the picture.   There was a continuous musical score/sound effects soundtrack that played under the silent scenes. TCM has restored two out of the three songs (from the musical play version) sung in the prologue; however the pictorial material is lost so an \"OVERTURE\" placard is used for the visuals. (Heard are Tess Gardella singing \"Hey, Fella\" and Helen Morgan singing \"Bill.\"   Lost is Jules Bledsoe singing \"Old Man River.\"\n\nThe first talking sequence involves two scenes - the marriage proposal on stage during the \"Parson\" play and the following elopement.  The second talking sequence begins when Magnolia berates Ravenal for their fallen state,and goes on to add a montage where he goes to get money, his drunken return with the money, her visit to the bordello run by Hetty Chilson to return the money, recognizing Hetty as her former friend, Julie Dozier, Julie's reaction, Magnolia's return to find Ravenal gone and her mother waiting to say \"I told you so,\" Magnolia's attempt to find work, her eventual success and triumphant performance with Ravenal watching from the audience in tears - of this only the first few minutes survive.  The extended silence is played out with the addition of subtitles for half of the material to let us know what the characters are saying.\n\nAn \"Exit\" card at the conclusion is supported by someone singing \"Why Do I Love You?\"  The only song from the musical play used in the background scoring is \"Old Man River.\"\n\nThe film is basically a triangle between the young lovers, and the disapproving mother, Parthy.   As played by the dour and grim Emily Fitzroy, she is a statue of coldness and mean-heartedness.  Laura LaPlante and Joseph Schildkraut act very well and naturally as Magnolia and Ravenal.  Their story goes on a bit too long in the second half - one gets bored - but if there had been no musical play version, this would have looked very well with nothing to compare it to.\n\nStill the most exciting sequence as in all three versions is the arrival of the Show Boat in the opening scenes.\n\nThis is definitely a curio but worth preserving to give us a third view of the same material in film terms and to see and hear the narrative apart from the now overly familiar Kern-Hammerstein score.\n\nVery worth seeking out for at least one viewing.",

There are a few talking sequences but one track is lost (though recently rumored to have been discovered).\n\nBut being silent is this film's problem. What's really wrong is that the racial part of the story, much of what drives the plot in the stage version and the 1936 and 1951 versions is missing. In this version Julie (Alma Rubens) is fired from the show boat because Parthy (Emily Fitzroy) is jealous of her affection for the daughter Magnolia. In the other versions Julie is discovered as a black passing for white and married to a white man--a criminal offense in the 19th century South.\n\nBut most of the rest of the story is in place as grown-up Magnolia (Laura LaPlante) falls in love with her leading man Gaylord (Joseph Schildkraut) and leaves the show boar for a fast life in Chicago, where the husband's gambling reduces them to poverty and breaks up the marriage. Magnolia goes on the stage and becomes a hit as a \"coon shouter,\" a white singer of black music.\n\nThis version also features a drowning that does not appear in other versions of the play.\n\nLaPlante is good as sympathetic Magnolia, but Schildkraut is a tad gay as the husband. The changes in plot require Fitzroy to play Parthy as a raving hag. Rubens is touching as Julie; she would make one film after this in 1929 and would be dead in 1931 from drugs. Otis Harlan plays Hawks. That's it. The rest of the cast is made up of bit players.\n\nNo one sings \"Old Man River.\" Stick to the superb 1936 version starring Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, Charles Winninger, Helen Morgan, Helen Westley, Donald Cook, Hattie McDaniel, Paul Robeson, Queenie Smith, and Sammy White.",

They had to make up for the fact they had hired non-singers for the lead roles so some dialog was added.\n\nThey would have been better keeping it a straight silent. Some of Broadway's best shows were done in acceptable silent versions. Kid Boots, Rose Marie, and The Student Prince come to mind. \n\nFirst of all the whole subplot involving Julie and the miscegenation angle was completely eliminated. Considering that was a controversial theme in those days and gained Show Boat a pioneering reputation, why would you want to sacrifice it.\n\nLaura La Plante and Joseph Schildkraut as Magnolia and Ravenal are acceptable enough. But when the Jazz Singer was made it was the musical interludes with Jolson that made it a hit. There was no rhyme of reason for the parts where dialog was included.\n\nThe best performance in the film was Emily Fitzroy who plays Parthy Hawkes like a stone-faced harridan. The later versions with Helen Westley and Agnes Moorehead gave her a trace of humanity. This was one witch of a woman and she never lets up either.\n\nNow that Show Boat is an American classic and it's a classic because of the wonderful Kern-Hammerstein score, I'm not sure anyone would want to bother with this one.",

                "text": "This primitive Part-Talkie \"Super Production\" was thought lost until a few years ago, but the print that was eventually unearthed missed a sizeable portion of the dialogue and music track\u0085so that, for about 30 minutes during the second half, it features no sound at all (which makes one wonder why underscoring was not employed by the 'restoration' team to counter this utter silence) \u0096 with the spoken lines being superimposed in the form of subtitles over the image itself!\n\nIncidentally, I was under the impression that this was to be a Musical \u0096 since the coming of Sound ushered in a flood of such fare. However, it chose to follow the Edna Ferber novel and, consequently, differs to a considerable extent from the subsequent two musical renditions. The shooting incident during a performance occurs much earlier here; similarly, the Julie character gets ousted from the show boat while Magnolia is still a child; her fault in the eyes of her employers (whereas they would stick by her in later versions!) does not relate to race but rather morals, as she is eventually discovered to be the Madam of a clandestine brothel!; Captain Andy dies in a sea-storm in this case (while he is allowed to survive elsewhere) on the night Magnolia gives birth; the leading man's re-appearance at the end occurs on the riverboat rather than in a theater; most conspicuously, perhaps, the character of Joe (who sang the show's most enduring number, \"Ol' Man River\") barely registers this time around! \n\nEven if we do get to see the heroine \u0096 a rather unlikely Laura LaPlante, best-known as the imperiled heiress of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927; itself a studio-hopping warhorse) \u0096 performing and strumming on a banjo a couple of times, these turn up during the stretch where the soundtrack goes missing! Ironically, though most of the songs were dropped, this still emerges as the longest version at 119 minutes; the IMDb lists an even longer running-time of 147 and, since only 2 of the 5 announced songs are heard during the \"Overture\" (one of which features Helen Morgan, the Julie of James Whale's 1936 remake!), this may well be true. Given the straightforward narrative in this version, the inherent mawkishness (what with Magnolia's insufferably prudish mother) of the unfolding drama is much more to the fore now. Still, the money problems afflicting the hero (nicely played by Joseph Schildkraut, from Whale's THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK [1939] and which I also viewed recently!) are better delineated here than later \u0096 while sets and expository footage came in handy when dusting off the property just 7 years afterwards! That said, the last act feels just as rushed as always.\n\nI am not familiar with how SHOW BOAT passed on to MGM (from Universal) but the closing title card, obviously bearing the epithet \"The End\", of this particular version is unaccountably accompanied by the Metro logo \u0096 for the record, a similar situation exists with respect to the 1931 Paramount version of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE! Finally, comparisons between the 1929 and 1936 movies unequivocally favor the latter, which is stylish where this is generally stodgy. For the record, I own another film by the same director \u0096 UNCLE TOM'S CABIN (1927), based on yet another chestnut \u0096 with which this also happens to share its Southern setting.",

                "text": "...but frustrating if judged as a talkie. I use the term \"talkie\" in the loosest of terms, because very few talking passages survive. In a tragic reverse of what is the case of many dawn of sound era films, the video film elements for this movie largely remain and do so in good quality, and the talking and singing passages largely do not. For example, you can find CDs of the entire soundtrack of 1929's Gold Diggers of Broadway - minus a very little - but it is the film itself that no longer exists with the exception of two reels. We owe this to the durability of Vitaphone discs and to the throw-away attitude that the film industry had towards these early talking and part-talking experiments.\n\nThere is a prologue at the beginning of the film in which stars from the Ziegfeld production do numbers from the musical, and the video portion of that is lost. Then the first half of the film is largely silent with synchronized sound effects. The second half of the film was largely synchronized dialogue, but the audio portion has been largely lost. All that remains where there is both video and dialogue are two short scenes between romantic leads Laura LaPlante (as Magnolia) and Joseph Schildkraut (as Gaylord Ravenal). Notice that the film has Ms. LaPlante billed ahead of the now well-known Schildkraut. LaPlante was a big star at Universal at the time having starred in films such as \"The Cat and the Canary\".\n\nThis incarnation of \"Show Boat\" differs from the 1936 and 1951 versions in big ways besides just the technical aspects. For one, a large portion of this film is devoted to the disintegration of the Ravenal marriage after the couple leave the Show Boat. Also, Julie is only a passing figure in this film, and Captain Andy has a completely different fate than in the latter two films.\n\nIn spite of all the odd decisions - to put the musical numbers associated with Ziegfeld in as a prologue, and to make this musical a part-talkie with non-musical stars in the first place, the film made money for Universal, largely outside the big cities where people had not seen Ziegfeld's Broadway version. In short, this is an example of a film that was dated in technique as soon as it was made, but was rushed out the door in order to cash in on the dawn of sound in motion pictures.",

The exercise left me extremely surprised. Though Whale's film is quite wonderful, featuring remarkable photography, the incomparable voice of Paul Robeson, and the greatest version of Ol' Man River ever recorded, 1929's Show Boat was a much more emotional experience for me. It is, of course, deeply unfortunate that most of the original sound elements for the film have been lost, but the silver lining in this cloud is the opportunity to more fully appreciate the remarkable performances of Laura LaPlante and Joseph Schildkraut as professional singer Magnolia Hawks and her good for nothing husband Gaylord Ravenal. The tragedy of the film plays out like a Dreiser story (perhaps it's time I read Ferber's source novel), and Gilbert Warrenton's cinematography is astonishingly beautiful, but LaPlante and Schildkraut are the heart and soul of Show Boat. The film's final shot is amongst the most beautiful ever captured on film. If Show Boat had been shot a couple of years earlier, I believe it would now be regarded as one of the highlights of silent cinema. As it stands, it now exists in that bizarre silent/sound transition netherworld, but is still deserving of much greater appreciation.",

I was delighted to realize that the retiring Magnolia, singing unknowingly to a tear-stained Ravenal in the audience, is in fact singing a slow Lena Horne-ish \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man of Mine\". If they can't find that soundtrack, I say, what the heck, see what Marni Nixon's doing these days and give her the job!

It was televised the other day, and I finally got my chance to see it.\n\nThe film is not a catastrophe by any means, but it certainly isn't good, either. It is mostly silent, and much of the dialogue and singing that was originally part of the film has either been lost forever or simply not found yet. Some of the film's two-reel prologue has turned up (both sound and picture) in A&E's biography of Florenz Ziegfeld, so somebody should obtain those excerpts and include them as part of this showing. It is inexcusable for Turner not to have done so. At present, none of the prologue in the TCM print is shown visually; it's all audio, with an \"OVERTURE\" card on the screen as the songs are sung. And as of now, only two of the five songs originally filmed for the prologue are heard. The prologue now ends with Otis Harlan heard enthusiastically saying, \"And now, Jules Bledsoe will sing 'Ol' Man River'!\" - however, we never get to see or hear this portion!\n\nThe singing by choral groups supposedly heard on the soundtrack isn't in this print of the 1929 film either; all we get during the action is orchestral accompaniment and a few sound effects. Jules Bledsoe's voice can be heard on the soundtrack at the end, singing \"The Lonesome Road\", a fairly good number also in the style of a work song, but no match for the great \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nAs for the acting, it never becomes the kind of silent film or early talkie acting that strikes people as unintentionally funny. Laura la Plante and Joseph Schildkraut are actually quite good in their dialogue scene on the stage of the show boat (here, as in the 1936 film version, renamed the Cotton Palace). Schildkraut, especially, is good, his Viennese accent hardly getting in the way. He shows a surprising and welcome ability to act \"intimately\" as opposed to the hammy overacting featured in most early talkies, except in the scene where he gets drunk. Gaylord Ravenal is presented as being much more of a jerk in this version than in the Kern-Hammerstein musical adaptation; he is shown being especially nasty (verbally) to Magnolia when his gambling luck runs out.\n\nThe film is directed in a very flat style; nothing in it seems especially interesting and one never becomes involved in the story; in fact, the musical version presents the story more dramatically. The racial angle in the original Ferber novel and in the musical is completely eliminated in this 1929 version, however, draining the film of much of its potential dramatic power and leaving it little more than a romantic soap opera. And without the beautiful Kern-Hammerstein score to hear, except for those two songs in the prologue and an orchestral rendition of \"Ol' Man River\" played as background music during the boat's arrival, one is tempted to ask, \"Why bother with this version when you can have the classic 1936 film, or even the 1951 remake?\"",

The passionate relationship soon causes problems for Frau Ir\u00e8ne who finally will decide to leave behind her luxury bourgeoisie life, living then a completely new life together with her lover in Algeria. Of course she must deal with continuous mistaken situations that arise with people not understanding their relationship because of their age difference. Further complications develop when a young woman Miss Dickson ( Frau Lya Lys ) appears in the vicinity.\n\n\"Maman Colibri\" ( Mother Hummingbird ) (1929) is one of the last silent films directed by the great French film director Herr Julien Duvivier before his long talkie career; it's a very interesting oeuvre wherein the director's artistry is shown at its best.\n\nFor example, the use of technical and special effects ( double exposures, zoom, continuous travelling shots ) and vivid camera work, especially the effective use of close-ups, creates the perfect mood for the film, capturing the differences between middle class life in a metropolis and exotic Algeria.\n\nThe couple must cope with many prejudices against their relationship. Frau Ir\u00e8ne realizes that her love for Herr Georges will destroy her family and the easy life of luxury and comfort she enjoys, all of which she sacrifices to be with her in young lover with no strings attached. Their new life in Algeria to which Herr Georges is assigned due to his military work, is so radically different from the old one. Herr Duvivier illustrates this new situation with many local images and deferment's of this European colony. Of course then trouble appears, namely Miss Dickson... This marks the end of the love between the older mature woman and the young man. Their two years of passion end bitterly and Frau Ir\u00e8ne returns to France.\n\nHerr Duvivier handles the story in an elegant and idealized way leaving the morals and patronizing to Frau Ir\u00e8ne's husband and eldest son. He depicts a love that is pure and heedless of age differences and social conventions. Frau Ir\u00e8ne returns to her old life but will never forget what she had with her young lover or regret that episode in her life. The film ends with a poignant shot of Frau Ir\u00e8ne watching her little grandson.\n\nAnd now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has an appointment with a Teutonic rich heiress older than him.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",

At the height of the Great Depression, this proposition could drive a wife to commit suicide. How is Carrie going to get everything for dinner and make a good impression?\n\nWhen Bert arrives with Mr. Mason, he introduces him to Carrie. Everything seems to be in order. When they sit to dinner, the only beverage Carrie has is some ginger ale! Mr. Mason proceeds to ask Bert his opinion about who is the best candidate for the job. When he names someone else, Bert tells his boss he has made a wise decision, even though he is hurting inside for being overlooked. Mr. Mason smells something burning, and sure enough, the dinner has been burned! What else could go wrong? Carrie questions Mr. Mason about why has he denied Bert the promotion, as she breaks down feeling their chances escape her husband. It's at this time that Mr. Mason decides to go back to town and he takes a moment to explain to Bert that he has something much better for him because he has taken the right approach and he has put the business needs ahead of his own.\n\nThis Vitaphone one reel packs a lot of ideas in a short time. Directed by Arthur Hurley, this short film should be seen by people trying to get ahead in the business world. Of course, times have changed and it's a different environment; no one today could believe in the way Bert reacts, but obviously, the person that really mattered took notice of his sacrifice.\n\nSylvia Sidney, in one of her earliest appearances, plays Carrie, the wife that dares to question her husband's boss.

I try to do as much research as I can and it is not my intention to deceive anyone, for sometimes the film does exist. I am more than delighted if someone has knowledge of a film listed as lost but survives, as I wish all silent films did survive. I hope the reader enjoys this brief synopsis.\n\nTwenty-nine minutes late into Chicago, engineer Anderson ( Lon Chaney ), nicknamed Grumpy because of his single-minded devotion to timetables and railroad protocol, plows through heavy snowdrifts to make up lost time. His sons have followed into the railroading business, but they are gradually embittered by his apparent callousness. One of them was worked to exhaustion as the fireman of the Chicago run through the snow but gained sympathy from Zella ( Phyllis Haver ), a nightclub singer whose private car Anderson had refused to tow, forcing her to jump into the cab and ride. His stubborn inflexibility eventually alienates his in-laws, causes the death of one of his sons, and provokes a wreck on the train on which the body was being carried by scuffling with his other son over his culpability for the death. Relegated to the railroad machine shop, he is called to service during the crisis of the Mississippi floods, and he ends up, along with his estranged son, at the throttle of a relief train that blasts through the flooded area on track often submerged as much as 4 feet to save the widow of his son and Zella, who are stranded in the flood area.\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon's audience seemed to find THUNDER a good picture, even though it did appear now and then that coincidence was playing a larger part in the railroad than the safety signal system...When the picture gets away from railroad procedure, Mr. Chaney seems admirable. But railroad men the country over will view some of the scenes with a jaundiced eye.\" ---The New York Times \n\n\"Lon Chaney does an exceptionally fine characterization, without the aid of any special makeup aside from slightly greyed hair and moustache...William Nigh's direction was very satisfactory; and the story by Byron Morgan is out of the usual run of railroad melodramas and finely developed.\" ---Motion Picture News\n\nThis 1929 drama was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, starring Lon Chaney, Phyllis Haver, George Duryea and James Murray. It was a silent film, with synchronized music and sound effects. Today, about 5 minutes of footage survives, at Library of Congress, UCLA Film Archives (both have short fragments).",

                "text": "\nThis fine movie directed by Howard Hawks is more potent for its absolutely dazzling aerial photography and filming, one of the best I've ever seen - much better than the eighties Top Gun. First, let me say the late twenties to late thirties was the height of what is known as the Aviator movie. Many hits were scored using this genre including this one which was a blockbuster in 1930. The thirties aviator movies in their flight sequences have a certain feeling to them. They are so realistic in look, and this is achieved without music being used, but just the whirring of the engines gaggling, give it a prescient omniprescence that advances in movie technology, Digital imagery and CGI can't duplicate. I mean, any of the thirties aviator pictures sparkle in their flight segments. It must be the way they were shot. I wonder what technique was used. The story for this movie which won an Oscar was written by John Monk Saunders who obviously knew the genre well. He also wrote Wings, the first Academy award winner, Legion of the Condemned, an even bigger hit than Wings with Gary Cooper, Devil Dogs of the Air and West Point of the Air. The leads are Richard Barthelmess and Doug Fairbanks jr. Barthelmess gives the real performance here while Fairbanks gives the movie star performance. They are involved in WWI and are ace pilots and best of friends. The film has a pandemic tone and regurgitating pace that feeds the ennui of war. Like the pilots of Top Gun, they tend to go against orders given by their boss, silent screen leading man, Neil Hamilton who has the tough job of sending men on their missions, missions in which lives will surely be lost. He doesn't like it but he has to follow orders. That is the theme of the movie, obeying and serving your job because it is necessary. Life is hard and fulfilling your function/role against all odds is rote. Tough choices have to be made for the greater good. Cliche but true. That is the irony of war and when one falls, another must takes his place. Barthelmess eventually takes Hamilton's job and in his shoes feels the pressures the man felt and the toughness of following necessary orders. It is not an anti-war movie, more than it is a WAR IS HELL! but heaven is only one more day of hell away. Slow because of early talkie cameras which needed absolute silence to be recorded and were static without any movement, but sets are highly believable and bombing raids uncharacteristically realistic. Dialogue though is a bit pedestrian with certain heavy-handed moments, in today's glare, and performances not up to par in certain areas but overall, a fine movie. ",

John Monk Saunders wrote the original story for the screen that netted The Dawn Patrol an Academy Award for that category.\n\nThe story centers on three men. Group commander Neil Hamilton who has to send his men up against some of Germany's best fliers and two of his senior pilots, Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Hamilton is a troubled man indeed, having to send barely trained kid pilots and he hears about it from Barthelmess and Fairbanks.\n\nOne fine day, oddly enough to do a daring assault that Barthelmess and Fairbanks pull off, Hamilton gets a promotion up to the staff headquarters. In a curious bit of poetic vengeance he names Barthelmess his replacement.\n\nOf course when Barthelmess now is seeing the war from Hamilton's point of view, he starts to behave differently. What he does and the choices he makes are the basis for the rest of this story about some of the United Kingdom's most gallant generation lost in the first terrible total war of the last century.\n\nAs Fairbanks and Barthelmess criticize Hamilton in what he does, I do wonder about when they were the fresh recruits. They became the veterans more than likely by sheer chance that they did survive. Yet that never plays a part in their thinking.\n\nThe aerial combat sequences are excellently staged, Howard Hughes and William Wellman could hardly have done better. They were so good that they got used again in the 1938 remake of this film.\n\nThe Dawn Patrol also marked the film debut of Frank McHugh who graced Warner Brothers films for the next 20 years. I've said in many comments and on their respective pages that it could almost not be a Warner Brothers film without either Frank McHugh or Alan Hale or both in a given feature, they appeared so often. The brothers Warner, got their work out of those two.\n\nThe 1938 remake with Errol Flynn, David Niven, and Basil Rathbone is the one most are familiar with. Still this one is the real deal.",

You aurally count the number of planes coming in (off-camera) while watching the reaction of the principals inside the office. You even get the correct fidelity of the wind-up gramophone as characters talk over it. Meanwhile, you watch aerial dogfights that switch seamlessly from soundstage re-creations to actual footage made by a camera mounted at the front of an aeroplane, without any jarring sense of displacement. The melodrama remains palpable with very little over-acting. I'm taking one point off for that occasional over-acting, and for the really dumb use of Southern California semi-desert topography in which the planes take off and land. It wouldn't have been that hard to find a location with a few more trees and more grass. Oh, well. The movie still must have knocked the original audiences' socks off.",

Neil Hamilton (police commissioner Gordon in the 60's Batman TV series) is Major Brand, in charge of handing out commands and assignments among his group of fliers. One day Courtney and Scott pull off a daring air raid that they have been ordered not to do by Brand. When they return, their success causes Brand to be promoted just as he is about to punish Courtney, and now Barthelmess' Dick Courtney is named as replacement and the new commander of the unit.\n\nNow instead of risking death himself, Courtney is the one ordering others into harm's way, and it is cracking him up as he turns more and more to drink. However, he still has Scott's friendship until a new recruit arrives and is ordered into a fatal battle. Now it is Scott who not only has no use for Courtney, but no use for life itself, and it is up to Courtney to make sure that Scott doesn't throw his life away.\n\nThis film, like many early talkies, is long on talk but short on the kind of aerial action you'd probably expect in a film about World War I fliers. Only towards the last third of the film do you see much in the way of dogfights. The focus is mainly on the fliers themselves and the futility of war. Barthelmess gives a great and poignant performance as Dick Courtney, and he lasted longer in talking pictures than most silent film actors due to his great skill. Also remember that most of the films made about World War I during this time were essentially anti-war films. By the beginning of the depression, WWI seemed a wasted effort in both money and manpower, and these early talking picture war films reflected that attitude.\n\nThe version of this film starring Errol Flynn is what most people remember. It's too bad this version didn't at least rate as an extra feature on that DVD. It makes for an interesting comparison.",

I don't remember exactly was the CO said when he opened the orders relieving him. I believe the line goes, \"Now see what you can do now that you can't do everything you want.\" The tension between the commander and his second is what find to be the most interesting part of the movie. Top Gun simply lacks that type of insight. Top Gun is more of an adventure story of a hot dog pilot.\n\nMovies comparable to Dawn Patrol in the military war genre which attain the understanding of the conflict at the top.are Major Dundee, Twelve O'Clock High and surprisingly the John Wayne film Flying Leathernecks.\n\nThis film was remade in 1938 with Errol Flynn in the lead role.

It's bloody suicide. Yet there is gallantry in the air and on the ground. Pilots who are going down in flames salute the enemy pilot who has brought them to this sorry state. There was little of that gallantry left in World War II, except in one instance in which an American P-47 pilot damaged an enemy fighter. The pilot bailed out and sailed past the American's canopy, upright and in full salute.\n\nThe British pilots we see -- almost all of them American -- are jovial enough in their day room or whatever it is. If someone is shot down, the loss is overcome by an excess of booze and song. The gramophone plays a scratchy \"Poor Butterfly\" (how apt) and the men drink and sing \"The world is made up of lies/ So hurrah for the next man who dies.\" The pilots are in good shape, pretty chipper, compared to their commander, who is filled with guilt and rapidly becoming a neural shambles. He snaps at the men, barks out orders, and has no sense of humor. The men can't understand this until one of them, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is promoted to Flight Commander and takes his place.\n\nThe film is an early talky. There is no underscore: we hear only the men singing and the gramophone playing. And it's stagy. There aren't many outdoor scenes; the men swill booze and argue and play cards in the day room. The message itself is overstated.\n\nBut, ah, the scenes of flight. Great whirling masses of biplanes, some spinning down and trailing smoke. Lots of stunts with airplanes too. It's more like a comic book than like reality but, well, consider the period. The special effects aren't bad. More realism and a more complex message can be found in a relatively recent movie like \"The Blue Max.\" Howard Hawks is uncredited but listed as a German pilot. Well, there is only one German pilot we get to see anything of. He's a victim of one of the fliers on our side and has been brought to the day room for a bash before being taken off to the Gef\u00e4ngnis, where he must have woken up with a terrible hangover. He looks nothing like a young Howard Hawks. True, Hawks was trained as a flier in the Army but somebody is pulling the wool over somebody's eyes around here.",

Although the film could use some scoring to enhance the experience (there's only a bit of diegetic music from the phonograph), there are two fantastic action sequences with stunning aerial photography and stunts, particularly the raid on the German camp. The handing over of power (and guilt) to a new commanding officer is an interesting device that I don't think I've seen explored in another film, at least not quite the same way. There are some flaws: a few poor performances and an over-reliance on clunky exposition (it makes me groan whenever I see someone on the phone repeating everything in question form: \"What's that you say? We've got to take the bridge!?\").

In many ways, it reminded me of WWII films, COMMAND DECISION and 12 O'CLOCK HIGH because they, too, talk about the burden of leadership and responsibility of sending men to their deaths. So it's obvious that this is NOT your typical \"war is fun\" type film you so often see! As far as the film goes, it was quite dandy but unfortunately, the 1938 version really wasn't all that different. About the only noticeable difference was that more actors actually spoke with British accents in the remake. Because they are so very similar, I recommend you only see one unless you are a real purist. And, if I needed to say which one, I'd say the later version is slightly better--mostly because it is a bit more polished. The 1930 version lacks background music (something shared by most films in 1930), though otherwise they are neck and neck as far as which one is best.

Dick Courtney (Richard Barthelmess) is the ace pilot facing the problem that his squadron is sent on mission impossible almost every day. Major Brand (Neil Hamilton) is his commander who suffers under the circumstances that he has to send inexperienced pilots on those missions with the knowledge that every time his squadron is at least halved.\n\nThe first half of the film we see the struggle between Courtney and Brand. The Major is criticized and blamed by Courtney for sending all those young pilots into their untimely death. Brand defends himself because he only follows the orders of his superiors. Then Major Brand is promoted and Courtney becomes commander of the squadron. Instead of flying with his pals he faces a career behind a desk and after a while he realizes that he is in the same position as Major Brand before him. He looses himself in depression and alcohol before operating in a final heroic flight.\n\nAt first we don't see to many action in this movie. Most scenes are in Major Brand's office or at the bar of the airport. We see the companionship between the pilots but also the despair, the fear and a lot of drinking. In the second part we follow the pilots as they do their missions. Taking into account that this movie was made in the early thirties the war in the air is very well pictured. Those scenes were used again for the remake of 1938. Still I don't think that The Dawn Patrol gives a realistic view of the lives of RAF pilots during the Great War. It wouldn't be possible to consume so many alcohol and still control those early airplanes to survive the missions into enemy territory.\n\nThe film shows a lot of respect for the pilots but also for the enemy. When a German is captured he joins the drinking bout before he is taken to prison. The most striking moment in the film is the salute that Courtney gives the German pilot who has just shot him down. The pilots are portrayed as modern knights whose war in the air knows other rules and the dirty war on the ground.\n\nSo in a year wherein legendary anti war films like All Quiet on the Western Front and West front 1918 were made The Dawn Patrol was already a bit old fashioned. Although the harsh reality of war is shown by the losses of young men's lives and the hard choices that the command of squadron had to made the film also glorifies the pilots, their loyalty and their respect for their enemy. The action scenes are very well photographed but that doesn't compensate the long scenes in the office and at the bar with drunken pilots.

Neither should be mistaken for the much-inferior 1940 \"Flight Command\" about Navy pilots, which starred Robert Taylor.) \n\nIn either version, \"Dawn Patrol\" is a stirring and exciting story of the courage shown by pilots who know they or their friends will likely be killed on one of their missions, and the anguish their commanders feel when sending them to their deaths. Set on the battlefields of WWI, it is filled with exciting and realistic (because it IS real) flying from the age of \"knights of the air.\" In fact, whole sequences (especially flying scenes and the climactic attack) were lifted directly from this film for use in the remake. \n\nAlthough it's a close call, I'd have to say this is one of the rare instances when a remake improves upon its predecessor, and recommend the 1938 film over the 1930 one, for the superior performances of the lead actors. 1938's Errol Flynn (as Dick Courtney) was more involving than 1930's Richard Barthelmess, a veteran actor whose performance retains the somewhat stilted quality of silent film era. And although Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was excellent in the 1930 version as pilot Doug Scott, David Niven in the same role positively sparkles in several more light-hearted, even comedic scenes. And of course, 1938's sneery Basil Rathbone makes for a much more despicable Major Brand (as the story calls for) than the original film's Neil Hamilton.\n\nFurthermore, current (as of 2012) releases of 1930's \"Flight Command / Dawn Patrol\" are not as visually clear in all scenes as the later version, and also have a lot of scratchy sounds and low rumble in the soundtrack, which are especially distracting in quieter scenes, particularly since the 1930 film did not have a musical soundtrack. Hopefully, remastered versions of both films will someday be available.\n\nStill, this is only nit-picking, as both the 1930 and 1930 versions of \"Dawn Patrol\" are excellent. But given the choice, go with Flynn and Niven of 1938.",

                "text": "\nI'll explain the weird title first: John Barrymore stars as a European prince named Christian Rudolf Augustus Christopher Ketler. When he goes off to war, he combines the initials of his five names into an acronym and calls himself 'General Crack' ... but Barrymore and most of the other cast members in this movie are playing characters whose first language would be German, so we don't know if Barrymore's character is aware of all the English-language (and Irish) implications of the word 'Crack'.\n\n I viewed a very bad print of 'General Crack' which was seriously deteriorated. The film is mostly black-and-white, but contained a colour sequence which is supposed to take place at the palace of the Archduchess Maria of the Holy Roman Empire: this sequence was almost completely deteriorated, so I can't comment on it, and I may have missed a few plot points elsewhere in the movie.\n\n This film takes place in Europe, a couple of decades before the Crimean War. Barrymore plays a Graustarkian prince. For reasons which I failed to catch, he marries a sloe-eyed Romany (Gypsy) girl named Fidelia. This is completely implausible: in those days, a nobleman couldn't possibly marry a commoner (much less a Gypsy) and hope to retain his title. Look what happened to Edward VIII, a hundred years later. When Fidelia betrays him (she should have changed her name to Infidelia), Crack abandons her and marries Archduchess Maria. Royal intrigues ensue, none of them very interesting and all of a sub-Mayerling nature.\n\n I suppose that 1930 audiences went to this movie to hear Barrymore's voice and to see him play romantic scenes. On those counts, he doesn't disappoint. The soundtrack is poor but it conveys Barrymore's rich baritone voice and splendid diction. In this movie, he spends a lot of time pitching woo to beautiful actresses, exhibiting his famous profile while wearing elaborate military uniforms, and generally buckling his swash.\n\n As the (not arch enough) Archduchess, Marian Nixon is quite pretty and delicate but she utterly fails to convey the dignity and authority that such a personage would possess. We can't accept that she's been trained from birth for this high position. Otto Matieson is excellent in a supporting role. Julanne Johnston is attractive, and she steals one scene very effectively.\n\n I shan't rate this film, as the print which I viewed was badly damaged and incomplete. But Barrymore's considerable talent shines through. Despite its howlingly unlikely plot, this may well have been an excellent movie.",

                "text": "The film's prologue has the Duke of Kurland (JB must have loved this part as he gets made up to be old!) holding a banquet for his officers and is bemoaning his lack of an heir when a ragged boy enters the hall and identifies himself as Christian, the duke's son by a gypsy princess now dead. This has a great part for the young boy (played by Philippe De Lacy who also played the young Don Juan age 10 with Barrymore) as he gets to slap Barrymore's face!! Twenty years later, Prince Christian is a powerful leader, a soldier of fortune and known as GENERAL CRACK (BARRYMORE). When compelled by Leopold II (Lowell Sherman) to offer his services, Christian demands a high price in gold and the hand of the Archduchess Maria Luisa (Marian Nixon), when he overhears court gossip saying the Emperor forbid his sister to meet General Crack as she could never meet his mother!! Back at his headquarters and within the deadline of 3 days, the Emperor agrees to GENERAL CRACK's terms.\n\nEnroute to Vienna, he encounters Fidelia (Armida), a spirited gypsy dancer and under the spell of gypsy lore, he tells his men to ride on without him saying he has been \"unavoidably detained\". 3 days after keeping the Emperor and Archduchess waiting, he rides back to Vienna. At court he announces the reason for his delay and proudly introduces his wife, Fidelia! Maria Luisa is the first to congratulate them and GENERAL CRACK is astounded at her kindness and beauty. They are guests of Leopold and he becomes infatuated with Fidelia at a court celebration. Colonel Gabor (Otto Matieson) is GENERAL CRACK'S most trusted aid and he makes it known to the Emperor that he could also be his! (Unfortunately, there's a small scene here on a Balcony where Fidelia is talking to Gabor but then it jumps to GENERAL CRACK talking to Fidelia on the balcony. From images of Lobby Cards, photos etc, General Crack is trying to strangle Gabor over the Balcony, so one can only presume what Gabor was saying or getting up to with Fidelia!) \n\nThe night before GENERAL CRACK goes away to war, he gives Fidelia a necklace and asks her if she still remembers what her name means? Fidelia says it means Faithful but why do you ask? While GENERAL CRACK is away at war, Leopold forces his attentions on the bride and now a vengeful Colonel Gabor, arrives at GENERAL CRACKS's headquarters to tell him that he watched the Emperor enter Fidelia's chamber and stayed there all night. GENERAL CRACK tells him he'll have him flogged if he mentions his wife's name again but when Gabor produces the necklace GENERAL CRACK gave to Fidelia, GENERAL CRACK flies for Gabor and silence him by gagging and taping his mouth. The Emperor arrives at GENERAL CRACK's base and is just in time to watch Gabor being executed. He asks GENERAL CRACK what is the reason and GENERAL CRACK tells him 'for saying something that should never be heard about the Emperor and his wife'. The Emperor sees the necklace in GENERAL CRACKS hand and realises he knows. \n\nGENERAL CRACK then returns to the Emperor's palace in Vienna to see Fidelia just as she is posing for a painting dressed in her gypsy costume, which she thinks will please him. However, he sends her back to her gypsy tribe. Returning back to war and winning Brussels for Leopold, he tells him that although he promised he would win him the crown he doesn't intend to keep it there! Ever more powerful GENERAL CRACK's army then takes over and Leopold and Maria Luisa become fugitives. However, they are found, captured and brought to him. GENERAL CRACK tells The Emperor that he must balance the books but unfortunately he doesn't have a wife! Leopold is taken away and Luisa is left alone with GENERAL CRACK. (Now this is one of my favourite scenes in the film.) GENERAL CRACK tells Luisa that gypsies have a quaint custom - an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! He then forcefully kisses Luisa but she slowly puts her arms around him. (I thought this kiss/embrace shows much more passion than the famous Sea Beast kiss!) Mystified by her reaction, she tells him that she loves him. Alas, his revenge has fallen flat on his face and he lets the Emperor and Archduchess free. Returning back to his seat as Duke of Kurland, GENERAL CRACK accepts Maria Luisa's offer to be elevated as Archduke of Kurland. \n\nThe film was shot immediately after he and DOLORES COSTELLO returned from their honeymoon cruise. Barrymore looks wonderful in this film even though he was drinking heavily and was hospitalised during the shooting for an ulcer. There are some wonderful profile and posing shots of Barrymore, and again he's added a few of his own comic mannerisms to the film, which made me laugh!! (If you KNOW Barrymore, you'll KNOW what I mean!) No doubt, copies of this film will eventually get around so hopefully everyone can enjoy it as much as I do.",

Both Eilers and Lombard probably had the same type of temperament being both fun loving gals with a salty vocabulary.\n\nPollard plays a matchmaking mamma who is very keen to see her Phyllis (Lombard) - an undecided blonde - married to the catch of the country club - Larry Lodge (Matty Kemp, who seemed to alternate between different series shorts when he wasn't taking uncredited bits in A features). It seems a sure bet, before Sally comes into the picture. She is fresh from a convent and the stepdaughter Mrs. McNitt wants to keep hidden, at least until Phyllis lands her catch. The laughs are few and unless the sight of Pollard and Johnny Burke fill you with mirth, the story is conventional.

A mother (Daphne Pollard) decides to hook up her daughter (Carole Lombard) but this plans gets off course when her stepsister (Sally Eilers) shows up unannounced. MATCHMAKING MAMMA really isn't going to appeal to anyone except for those who must see everything Sennett produced or those wanting to see Lombard before she would switch over to sound. Those expecting to see a lot of Lombard will be disappointing because she's given a pretty thankless role that basically has her either standing or sitting around. With that said, she's quite beautiful so her just being here certainly helps keep the film moving. The rest of the cast are pretty good with Pollard doing a fine job as the mother and Eilers manages to be quite cute, although her stealing the man from Lombard seems pretty weird when viewed today. Even Andy Clyde shows up for a quick role. The film's biggest problem is the fact that it really doesn't contain any laughs and it's almost like they didn't even try to do anything funny. Another reason why film buffs might want to watch this is because there's some 2-strip Technicolor footage of Sennett's Bathing Beauties.",

Pint-sized matron Daphne Pollard, married to her second husband (Johnny Burke), is producing an amateur play in an attempt at social climbing and landing young heir Matty Kemp for her daughter Carole Lombard. Trouble is Burke's daughter Sally Eilers shows up during rehearsals and he falls for her instead, despite initially thinking she was the maid.\n\nThis movie has a few brief scenes filmed in the early imperfect Technicolor. Ms. Pollard, something of a cross between Beatrice Lillie and character actress Maude Eburne, works hard to mine what little humor there is in the story. One major problem is Sally Eilers' bland wholesomeness cannot carry the story or be credibly more appealing than beautiful young Carole Lombard (who is fairly wasted here) as her stepsister. Matty Kemp, a Charles Farrell type, is quite handsome as the young male lead and smiles prettily and is appealing in a modest way. Plump young comedienne Madalynne Field, a Sennett staple, has a bit as the heftiest of the chorines.",

After reading the most negative review, and then actually watching the film itself, I wonder what some of you expect from a comedy. Certainly, this is not a Marx Brothers film and Joe E. Brown is not Groucho Marx. So what? It is a LIGHT comedy, a screwy comedy, and a character story. What's wrong with that? I can't watch Three Stooges ALL the time! As it is, I agree with those who thought that this is a very funny movie; the exposition in particular had me practically clucking in pleasure at Brown's outrageous characterization. \n\nIt does greatly help to see Joe E. movies in first-rate condition on a big screen. I saw the new DVD release from the Warner Brothers Archives, apparently struck right off the original negative or a safety negative, watched it on a 55\" flat screen, and it came across very nicely. There are a lot of things to look at in such a pristine print of a film this old and this well made. The actual filmstock was different back then, a little more grainy but very clear, immediately giving the movie that ancient 'vintage' quality, which I find engaging (I associate it with my favorite films of my childhood black-and-white TV viewing). The styles of hair, dress, and architecture are very clear and interesting (the \"heart test machine\" is particularly quaint). The painted backgrounds are beautiful and perfect, and the rear projection during the rather hair-raising finale is EXCELLENTLY done (as is the rear projection in the train). This is a very high-quality, high-production-value film with loads of extras and great care taken of all the cinematic details.\n\nThe flying bed and the unexpectedly bizarre physical exam are two highlights and both are very funny. No wonder there are no consequences for the main characters' charade\u0097they are obviously not the only frauds in this story! AND, for those of us who want to see more of Brown's specialty acts, he DOES get a funny song!\n\nIt's not a great film like a Chaplin film, or 'Duck Soup' or a wildly inventive W.C. Fields movie, but it is a COMPLETELY enjoyable Sunday-afternoon film, done up in perfect 1930s style, which I will rate 8 stars out 10.

I was trying to place his face and thanks to the other posted review here I at least know him from Some Like It Hot, but as a lead comedian this movie REALLY holds up well.

I mean I'm sorry I never saw that done before and its really funny!

Brown was still in a formative period. Lawrence Gray as a fellow newspaper reporter was decent, and certainly much better than Jack Whiting in another of Brown's 1930 films.

Walter Pidgeon is rather dashing here as the opposing pilot...although he had appeared in several films when this film was produced.

No known full prints exist with the musical numbers intact. \n\nThe finale -- an air race -- had potential, but wasn't realized.

It was originally an Earl Derr Biggers novel (author of Charlie Chan) and then a popular stage play in the teens. It was filmed 6 times between 1917 and 1947. None of the available versions are particularly interesting today.\n\nThe 1917 George M. Cohan film (one of his few starring roles in a film) was solid and gave a better overview of the story of the book. This 1929 Richard Dix version is like many early talkies, basically a filmed stage play. What is best about this one is that there is a germanic influence on the lighting and sets. There are some wonderful shots of Dix, when he arrives at the Inn, sitting in the dark next to the moody light of the fireplace. The story is never enthralling enough and we really feel like we are watching a stage play. It is interesting to look at it from that aspect, however.\n\nUltimately a curio, this 1929 film is worth watching if you are in the mood for an early talkie. The 1935 version is actually not as good as it is too light and whimsical and truly disappoints as it was made in the heyday of horror and mystery films.",

Dix accepted an offer of $5,000.00 if he could write a novel in this isolated place. He was given the only key and housekeepers were informed of his arrival and heated up the place for him. Dix sits at his typewriter and starts to work on his book which he has to complete in 24 hours in order to win the bet with his friend who owns the resort.\n\nYou will never be able to figure out just what happens and it is a real comedy as well as, a drama and a crime to be solved.",

The 1929 RKO production with Richard Dix is probably the closest you will find in replicating the stage perennial. Community theaters across the USA continue to insert BALDPATE into their season as it is a reliable crowd-pleaser. Dix is, well, Dix. He was seldom a good actor but he was always enthusiastic and energetic. Near the end of this picture he forgets he's doing a talkie and gestures beyond belief when describing the goings-on at Baldpate Inn. But we love him still. The rest of the cast is more than capable and, yes, the pacing is deliberate and stagy. BTW, for BALDPATE enthusiasts, be sure to check out the Lux Radio Theatre version of the play starring Jack Benny. In the meantime, next time this one comes around check it out. But remember, the movies had barely learned to talk so be forgiving...",

                "text": "1913 saw the release of the novel Seven Keys To Baldpate by Earl Der Biggers (a forgotten but very influential writer who also created Charlie Chan). That same year George M. Cohan adapted it for, and starred in, a hit stage version on Broadway. There were three silent movie versions in 1916 (from Australia), 1917 (the only one that still exists) and 1925. This is an early b/w talkie (hit) starring the very likable Richard Dix as a famous trash novelist who accepts a bet that he can't write a book in 24 hours while staying at the remote upstate New York Baldpate Inn (during a snowstorm). His work is interrupted by unexpected intruders of all kinds, all of whom believe they have the only existing key to the place. There's possible murder, mystery, intrigue and lots of droll comedy, and a double-twist ending. I enjoyed it quite abit. With Miriam Seegar, Margaret Livingston, DeWitt Jennings, Lucian Littlefield, Nella Walker, Alan Roscoe, Crauford Kent, Harvey Clark and Edith Yorke. Arthur Hoyt was cut out. To put this into context for horror historians, D.W. Griffith took the popular elements of Baldpate and made (the hit) ONE EXCITING NIGHT in 1922. This led to an Old Dark House revival that led to popular plays like The Cat And The Canary, The Bat and The Gorilla, which in turn led to classic movie adaptations that really ramped-up the horror elements, and a slew of imitations jostled for attention for years to come. James Whale's early parody was the brilliant THE OLD DARK HOUSE in 1932. Further Baldpate movies were in 1935, 1947 and 1982 (HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS).\n\nMovie reviews at: spinegrinderweb.com",

He's given what he believes is the only key but before long others are showing up with keys to enter the creepy mansion.\n\nGeorge M. Cohan's play of the Earl Deer Biggers novel was one of the biggest hits of its time and it got turned into three silent film adaptations including one from 1917 where Cohan played the lead role. This 1929 film from RKO was the first sound adaptation and it's honestly not too bad, although I didn't find it nearly as entertaining as the 1917 version. With that said, the film is certainly worth watching if you're a fan of the material or Dix.\n\nThe best thing going for this version is the fact that there's a good cast here that manages to make some of the snappy dialogue work extremely well. There's one sequence where seven characters are gathered up in the frame discussing the money trail and the deliver was perfect and made for the highlight of the picture. Dix also manages to turn in a fun performance here as his comic timing is right on the mark and he certainly helps keep the film moving.\n\nThe biggest problem with this version of SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE is the fact that it just runs out of steam around the forty-minute mark and never picks back up. Director Regionald Barker doesn't add too much flair to the picture and it's another example of an early talkie that just doesn't have too much going for it style wise.",

                "text": "So it seems for author Richard Dix who believes falsely that he has the only key to the summer inn Baldpate (closed for the winter) where he has agreed to stay to try and write his latest opus within a 24 hour period. Within minutes of his arrival (and the abrupt departure of the scaredy cat caretakers), he discovers that indeed, there are more keys, with the arrival of a gun-toting criminal, a female journalist and her mother, a sexpot pretending to be the wife of somebody she's never even met, a woman-hating hobo and various other eccentrics. The wind of the winter is hitting the shutters even as Dix arrives, giving the perfect atmosphere to this enjoyable version of the often filmed George Cohen play which mixes chills and comedy to the audience's delight. Don't let this early talkie's age scare you away from watching it as the creakiness of the early stagy filming truly works, making this much better than you would believe. Every character who shows up at the door has their own eccentricities and their own agenda, which adds to the tension and to the laughter as the plot expands to its riotous conclusion. This truly is a lot of fun, featuring a cast of mostly unknown or forgotten character actors who slightly underplay the melodrama to make it quite different than the dozens of other \"old dark houses\" which were overly abundant during the golden age of the cinema and mostly quite forgettable. You won't soon forget the opening shot of Baldpate as Dix arrives, and the conclusion will definitely seem to be an inspiration for Ira Levin's modern comedy thriller \"Deathtrap\".",

Richard Dix is the only one in the film with any energy in his delivery. Otherwise, they all sound like they are in a High School play--delivering stilted dialog in a very stilted manner. And instead of acting to show the plot progressing, the actors just talked and talked and talked!! Because of this I was bored stiff and really had to force myself to keep watching.

                "text": "This film is indeed believed lost, so no rating is possible. However, in Charles Bickford's autobiography he spends several pages talking about this film. It was actually made fourth in his filmography although it is shown as being first. Dynamite was Bickford's first film and the film that pulled him away from Broadway and towards Hollywood in the first place, Hell's Heroes at Universal was his second, and Anna Christie was his third. \n\nThe description of the film can be read at the New York Times archive of film reviews, but basically the plot has Lenore Ulric in the title role as a French girl raised in the south seas and brought to prim and proper New England by her New England born and bred sea captain husband, played by Charles Bickford. Rose wears short skirts, shocks the puritanical New Englanders in her new home with her wild candid ways, and chases other men when her husband is away including a doctor that she so badly wants to vamp that she feigns illness to get him near her bedside.\n\nBickford describes miss Ulric in the most flattering terms, both professionally and personally - \"beautiful, charming and a real pro\". This is interesting to hear since Bickford has little good to say about anybody in the film industry in his book, although in all fairness most of his scorn is heaped upon management and directors and he did seem to regard many of his fellow thespians highly. It's also interesting since Lenore Ulric was a leading lady in the silent era whose silent films have all been lost save a few that are reportedly locked away in the Library of Congress. This film was her last one for seven years and her last as a young woman - she was 37 when she made this film - so Bickford's description is about all we have to go on as far as having any knowledge of her talents in her prime.\n\nBickford goes on to describe the plot of South Sea Rose in two four letter words which I can't repeat here. He thought the plot pedestrian and trashy and appealing to only prurient interests. And here's the most interesting part of the story - how Irving Thalberg, head of production at MGM at the time, talked Bickford into doing this picture in spite of his hard-nosed opinion. \"A persuasive little guy\" Bickford calls Thalberg in reference to this episode.",

There are some great location shots and an authentic stage coach that helps introduce our main character in the beginning and is a vital link to the outcome of the film. The scenes are varied and short, so the pace of the film is good, but enough time is taken in the scenes between the Arizona Kid and Virginia (Carole Lombard) to allow us to believe they are falling in love. Unfortunately, Carole Lombard's acting is at its worst in this film. Her lines are delivered as if she was staring in a grade school play. However, the film keeps up ones interest and Carole plays quite a different part than is her norm, so it is well worth a viewing.",

He has wonderful chemistry with Kay Francis on this and other collaborations.\n\nSome other people to take note of are James Finlayson the great nemesis of Laurel&Hardy playing a bribed juror. Also William B. Davidson as the District Attorney who does something that Hamilton Burger never got to do with Perry Mason. Finally Thomas Jackson who the following year would play the same kind of dogged police detective in Little Caesar.\n\nFor The Defense is a great example of William Powell's smooth playing before his glory years at MGM.

The actor that works best in this is William Powell, who happened to be working at a time when the industry was full of experiments.

The job changes slightly but the tweaking of the police and the DA is as with most from this period. Also constant was the notion that the key character could control the world around him to some extent. In this case, the lawyer pays a particularly high price, but is able to twist the story precisely as he would wish.\n\nBy itself, its uninteresting.

William Powell plays William Foster, a flamboyant and successful defense lawyer that reminds me of Powell's Thin Man character except, unlike Nick Charles, William Foster is an unhappy man at his core. He gets drunk and pretty much stays that way to soothe this unnamed pain, not to add to the edge of a giddily happy life. His long-time lover, Irene Manners (Kay Francis), is the one thing he claims he can depend upon, but whenever he says this you get the feeling that he counts not even on that. Marriage is out of the question from Foster's standpoint, but Kay wants matrimony and finds someone who offers it in a less interesting package than Foster in the person of wealthy Jack Defoe. Jack and Irene meet late one night and take a ride in Jack's car to talk things out about the future - Irene is still unsure about how she wants to proceed. Irene is driving because Jack had been drinking. When Jack gets fresh, he causes the car to swerve and Irene hits a pedestrian. Jack sobers up quickly at this point and tells Irene to run away so he can claim responsibility for the wreck alone as he fears for Irene's reputation whether she is named as the driver or just a passenger. Unfortunately for Jack the pedestrian is dead. Also unfortunately for Jack, he still has the smell of alcohol on his breath when the police arrive.\n\nNow Jack is up for manslaughter. Foster has never liked Defoe because he considers him a spoiled brat, and now Irene is begging Foster to defend Defoe in spite of that, all the time trying to keep from Foster the fact that she was with Jack that night and that they were talking marriage. Defoe is maintaining the same charade as Irene. Meanwhile the district attorney and the police have had just about enough of Foster winning every case he takes and are keeping a close eye on his business practices. Who will go to jail? Will anybody go to jail? Watch and find out.\n\nWilliam Powell and Kay Francis were always great together because they usually played less than perfect people that made the perfect couple. Regardless of how things worked out for them at the end of their films, you just felt their characters were soul mates. This film is a great showcase of their talents when they were at the peak of their popularity in the 30's.",

They were all designed to give this ravishing beauty screen exposure but they also exposed something else - the fact that she had a natural talent. \"Street of Chance\" gave Kay her first sympathetic part and proved she could handle more demanding roles. In \"For the Defense\" her role has a lot of dimensions - she is not just a \"good\" girl or a \"bad\" girl. She is also teamed once again with William Powell - they were an early sound screen team.\n\nBill Foster (William Powell) is a smart, charismatic lawyer, who always gets his client off - no matter how bad the evidence looks. In a super court room sequence, Foster throws a phial of (supposed) nitro glycerin on the floor and causes a panic - all in an effort to prove a client innocent. Irene Manners (Kay Francis) is an actress who is head over heels in love with him. She jokingly asks him to marry her but he refuses, saying it would spoil everything. In a huff, she lets herself be coaxed by a lovesick boy, Defoe, into considering his marriage proposal. While driving Defoe home, Irene accidentally runs over and kills a pedestrian. Defoe takes the blame and Foster takes his case after Irene pleads with him. When Daly finds Foster has bribed a juryman, Foster then finds he is on trial. Thomas E. Jackson plays Daley as a slow talking, dry witted policeman - much the same as he did in \"Little Ceasar\" (1930). James Finlayson, who was usually harassed by Laurel and Hardy did a brilliant job as Parrot, the bribed juryman - he really shows himself a fine actor.\n\nIrene goes to the prosecution and threatens to go on the stand and tell the truth about the hit and run - even though her reputation will be damaged. Bill refuses to listen and pleads guilty. There is a heartfelt scene outside the prison where Irene convinces Bill that she will be there when he gets out.\n\nThis is an excellent court room drama with lots of twists.

While this might have made him famous in and of itself, his clients were a Who's Who of the scum of the day. Fallon defended mobsters, pimps and other low-lifes! The film \"For the Defense\" is based, in part, on Fallon's life--as is Warren Williams' film \"The Mouthpiece\"--which came out just two years later.\n\nThis film begins with William Powell playing William Foster--a hot-shot attorney who is known as much for getting off his slimy clients as his courtroom theatrics. However, while he seems like he's on top of the world, he has two serious problems--his drinking (which, in real like killed Fallon when he was still quite young) and his girlfriend, Irene (Kay Francis). The problem with Irene is that she loves Foster but he's unwilling to marry her (and the film STRONGLY implied they have been cohabiting) and she is entertaining a proposal of marriage from another guy! \n\nOne night when Irene is stepping out on Foster with this other man, she is driving during a hit and run death. Why she runs is never really believable, as she was neither intoxicated nor at fault as her drunk boyfriend sitting next to her really caused the accident. However, she leaves the scene and the boyfriend stays and takes responsibility-- saying that he was driving. And, since he was drunk, it looks like prison time for the guy. Naturally, Foster is called in to defend the guy--and the case ends up ruining Foster. How and why? See the film.\n\nThis movie is, in some ways, typical of many of the Pre-Code films. As I mentioned above, it is implied that Foster and Irene were doing the horizontal hokey-pokey ('sex' for those who prefer the more direct way of saying things). And, the film does glorify Foster (at least to a degree). But, it also shows that eventually evil is punished and Foster gets his comeuppance. Entertaining but a bit of a disappointment, as some might hope for more salacious Pre-Code shenanigans.",

He's a lawyer who plays strictly by the book but what rubs people the wrong way is that he gets criminals and thugs off of their crimes. Foster's skill is put to the test when the woman he loves (Kay Francis) asks him to defend a man that Foster knows loves her too. Things take a complicated turn when Foster learns that it was the woman who actually did the crime.\n\nBack in the 1930s it wasn't uncommon for Hollywood to take newspaper headlines and wrap them into a movie. This film is partially based on the career of lawyer William Fallon who was flawless when it came to defending some of the biggest criminals of the era. FOR THE DEFENSE is a really good movie that has some terrific performances, a rather good story and an ending that really packs a nice little punch. The film manages to keep you caught up in the story from the opening credits up until the very end so fans of classic Hollywood are really going to enjoy this.\n\nI think the greatest thing about the picture is the performance of Powell. When watching his films today it's amazing to see how easy he makes acting look because he could pretty much transform himself into any type of role and this here is what he is best at.\n\nThis is a very smart character, constantly thinking and constantly on the movie. Powell plays this with ease and manages to build a real character. Francis is also very good, although her role isn't nearly as memorable. William B. Davidson also deserves a lot of credit as the District Attorney who can never beat Foster and sees him getting criminals off as a major problem for the safety of the country.\n\nThe story itself has a couple nice twists and turns along the way and there's no doubt that director John Cromwell knows how to handle the material and he keeps the film moving at a very nice pace. The great thing about Turner Classic Movies is that you can always stumble across films with actors that you know but perhaps films you haven't heard of. It's really too bad that FOR THE DEFENSE isn't better known today because it's a perfect example of a great cast, a strong story and how these small movies used to be made for quality.",

Of course, Powell defends the bf.\n\nThe problem with Powell here is that he hadn't developed his mesmerizing urbanity yet. I guess I'm just not ready for Powell repeatedly calling Francis \"baby\". For the first half of the film you hardly see Francis at all, but of course she becomes central to the story in the second half of the film. Francis had not yet developed her acting skills here.

Powell plays an equally shady lawyer here in this pre-code Paramount film, going on to Warner Brothers for \"Lawyer Man\" and to MGM for \"Evelyn Prentice\".\n\nPowell is in love with the glamorous Kay Francis but she's also being pursued by the younger Scott Kolk who gets drunk one night and has Kay drive him home. While arguing over his drunken condition and his unrequited love for her, she accidentally runs into a man stranded on the highway, killing him. Sobering up quickly, Kolk orders Francis to escape and prepares to take the rap. Meanwhile D.A. William B. Davidson plots to prove that Powell bribed a witness while Francis deals with her conscience and Powell's discovery of the truth.\n\nInteresting for its pre-code elements which includes lots of sexual innuendo and drinking, this was the third pairing of Powell and Francis, and the first in which they were the leads. While she went onto bigger success at Warner Brothers (particularly in two outstanding 1932 films opposite Powell, \"One Way Passage\" and \"Jewel Robbery\"), her Paramount films usually presented her with a rather masculine haircut and limited screen time. Here, she's in high form, even with the short cropped coif, dressed to the nines, although one evening gown shows her to be rather flat chested. Nevertheless, she remains one of my favorite actresses from the 1930's, although I much prefer her films at Warners where she ranked as their top female star for much of the last half of the decade.\n\nAn interesting background shot has a movie theater showing the 1930 Columbia film, \"Broadway Scandals\", which is ironic considering that this was a Paramount film. The remainder of the cast is pretty obscure although Laurel and Hardy's frequent rival, James Finlayson, has a small role. Powell's character is particularly interesting, as even with all of his success in court, he's obviously deeply unhappy, being shown several times in a speak easy drinking up a storm and at one point, clearly passed out. He's also clearly untrustful of women, making it clear to Francis that he'd dump her in a hot minute if he ever suspected her of betraying him. The film is obviously very far-fetched and features an extremely hokey ending that is just too silly to believe.",

The Pre-Code Presentations are More Implied than Usual and have Very Little to Offer those Seeking this Out for Sleazy or Edgy Stuff. There is a lot of Drinking, a Few Skanky Characters and a Raccoon Coat for Some Flavor.",

While the film starts out rather slow, we find out almost halfway through the film, she thinks she's in love with another man, who wants to marry her. The pace picks up, due to a car accident they had. From there, it gets even more intricately involved, culminating in a rather abrupt albeit upbeat ending. This was a good little film, though not as great as I might have hoped, considering the lead actors. Also, the film definitely feels old and doesn't have the freshness a quick programmer would have. If you like the leads, you'll probably be pleased, but all in all, I've seen better films with Kay and William.",

Reluctantly, Alabam takes a sales assignment in ladies' accessories, where he's charming but clueless. Mickey, lazy and on the take, sees the store detective helping himself to a chocolate bar, so he wants that job. Dave learns the hard way that the customer is always right, Mickey puts the cuffs on the wrong customer, and Lake Arrowhead looks very far away."

This isn't the greatest short to come out of Hal Roach Studios but there are enough decent moments to make it worth sitting through if you enjoy these early sound shorts. I actually thought the first half of the film was better when the boys were on a train with a lot of girls and trying to pick them up. All three try for this one young lady are end up being rejected in some funny ways. The second portion of the film takes place at the department store and this is where the screenplay goes rather flat as we get the jokes you'd expect and none of them are very funny. One such joke includes Mickey arresting a famous shoplifter who of course turns out to be the store's best customer.

Sutton and Daniels are on a train--the widest train I've ever seen on a film! They annoy a young lady and their friend Dave (David Sharpe) arrives and tells them he's going to work for Grady's Uncle Ed (Edgar Kennedy). When Grady stops by to see Uncle Ed, he and Mickey are told by the uncle that BOTH of them are also going to work for him--and he's already talked to their parents about this. Apparently, during this summer vacation the lazy college students will not be having fun! Grady gives in--but Mickey is determined to do whatever job is easiest and asks to become a store detective. And, naturally, Mickey makes a mess of everything.\n\nWhile this film isn't bad, it isn't that great either. Part of the problem is Mickey Daniels' trademark laugh. Some people thought it was funny--I felt it was truly horrific. I did, however, like seeing Sharpe's actrobatics. While there really was no reason for his backflips, they were pretty remarkable.

            "Foremost on the minds of the subjects of Sylvania is when their beloved monarch, Queen Louise, will get married. Queen Louise, on the other hand, has no intention of doing so. Despite the Queen's beauty, she would have a difficult time finding a mate anyway because her husband would not be considered king - he would be given the title of prince consort - but have many of the responsibilities as a royal figurehead. Things change when one of her military attach\u00e9s, Count Alfred Renard, is sent back to Sylvania from his posting in Paris for a reprimand by the Queen due to his womanizing ways. They, attracted to each other, decide to get married. Life for the Prince Consort ends up not being as he envisioned. He feels he has nothing to do while the Queen, wearing the proverbial pants of the family, attends to her duties. In addition, he is supposed to obey her commands, not only as one of her loyal subjects but also as her husband. The Prince Consort showing public dissatisfaction with the marriage could prove fatal not only to the marriage but also to Sylvania as a country, unless he can show the Queen a different style of monarchy.",

Meanwhile, singing Queen Louise of Sylvania is being badgered by her cabinet to marry. Expecting disgrace, Renard finds instead that he's just what the Queen had in mind for a consort. But he finds the subordinate status of a prince consort increasingly hard to take.",
            "Count Alfred has disgraced his home country of Sylvania with one too many scandalous affairs with married women, and the ambassador of Sylvania commands him to return home. Alfred's manservant, Jacques, begs to come along, and his master relents. Alfred, burdened with a newly acquired French accent that makes him sound most un-Sylvanian, fears the wrath of his queen. But instead of having him shot, she falls in love with him, and he with her. The entire kingdom, which has had nothing on its mind except seeing the queen get married, is thrilled. As Jacques and Lulu the maid conduct their own romance, reveling in their commonness, Alfred discovers at the altar that his own marriage will be most uncommon - and a dire threat to his manhood. He may be marrying a queen, but he most definitely won't be a king."

                "text": "THE LOVE PARADE (Paramount, 1929) directed by Ernst Lubitsch, stars Maurice Chevalier in his second Hollywood musical (the first being 1929s \"Innocents of Paris\") and his first of four opposite Jeanette MacDonald in her screen debut. Jeanette plays Queen Louise of the Kingdom of Sylvania who immediately falls in love with Count Alfred Renard, a popular ladies' man, and soon marries this Parisian emissary in order to negotiate a loan from foreign power. After they wed, Alfred soon finds married life isn't what he has hoped, having to take orders from his wife as well as being second fiddle around the kingdom.\n\nIn spite of its age, THE LOVE PARADE is still quite entertaining early sound musical, consisted mostly of songs and limited dancing. With score composed by Victor Schewrtzinger and Clifford Grey, songs include, \"Oo-La-La-La-La\" (sung by Lupino Lane); \"Paris, Stay the Same\" (sung by Maurice Chevalier); \"Dream Lover\" (sung by Jeanette MacDonald/ ladies-in-waiting); \"Anything to Please the Queen\" and \"My Love Parade\" both sung by Chevalier and MacDonald); \"Dream Lover\" (reprise by MacDonald); \"Let's Be Common\" (sung by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth); \"The March of the Grenadiers\" (sung by MacDonald); \"Nobody's Using It Now\" (sung by Chevalier); \"The Queen is Always Right\" (recited by Roth and Lane/ staff); \"Dream Lover\" (reprise by MacDonald); \"March of the Grenadiers\" (reprise by soldiers); and \"My Love Parade\" (reprised by MacDonald and Chevalier).\n\nRunning ten minutes shy of two hours, THE LOVE PARADE was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture, with Chevalier's nomination for Best Actor, but no wins. Other members of the cast consist of Eugene Palette, Edgar Norton, Ethel Griffies and Lionel Bellmore. Look fast for silent comic Ben Turpin in a funny bit; and future film stars as Virginia Bruce as the lady-in-waiting, and Jean Harlow as one of the patrons in the ballet theater.\n\nFormerly presented on the American Movie Classics cable channel (January 1989-September 1996), AMC's host, Bob Dorian, noted an interesting piece of trivia that THE LOVE PARADE was the only movie in which Jeanette MacDonald smoked a cigarette on screen. Finally distributed to DVD in 2009, THE LOVE PARADE returned to cable television broadcasting once again, being Turner Classic Movies where it premiered February 3, 2010, with added bonus of two minute exit music in its fadeout. \n\nFull of comedy wit and unexpected surprises in the Ernst Lubitch tradition, THE LOVE PARADE is still worthy film study and entertainment value after all these years.

Depending much on the intelligence of the viewer, the film serves up unexpected bons mons of wit (e.g. the dog barking his farewells to the pooches of Paris) which never fail to enchant. Lubitsch would contribute a series of delightful little comedies over the next several years, making the title of this confection pertinent in more ways than one.\n\nMaurice Chevalier practically oozes Gaelic charm in a wonderfully hammy, ingratiating performance. His French charisma dominates the screen; he embraces his songs rather than just singing them. His immense joie de vivre & exceptional talent was perfectly attuned to the sound motion picture. In her film debut, the lovely Jeanette MacDonald proves a charming partner to Chevalier. Imperious or coquettish by turns, she beguiles the viewer as well as Maurice--her celebrated voice (when intelligible) put to good use in the seduction.\n\nBritish physical comedian Lupino Lane is a winner as Chevalier's highly energetic little valet; lanky Lillian Roth, as a palace maid, joins him for some humorous knockabout songs. Lionel Belmore & Eugene Palette bring appropriately hefty gravitas to their roles as government ministers. Diminutive Edgar Norton appears as an unflappable majordomo.\n\nMovie mavens will recognize silent screen comic Ben Turpin as a cross-eyed lackey, Russ Powell as the Afghan Ambassador and young Jean Harlow as one of a group of women applauding Chevalier at the theatre, all uncredited.",

                "text": "It was really the film that established Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald as a musical comedy team - the first one of the American talkie period. They would make four films in the end (THE LOVE PARADE, ONE HOUR WITH YOU, LOVE ME TONIGHT, and THE MERRY WIDOW). Four first rate early musicals... and they did not like each other! Jeanette rebuffed Chevalier's attempts at a closer relationship (she only liked Gene Raymond, whom she later married). He considered her a prude and hypocrite as a result. So, despite their stunning screen chemistry and string of successes their partnership faded. Nelson Eddy was waiting in the wings for her to find the proper partner.\n\nChevalier is a Count who has been returned from a diplomatic post for a sexual scandal. The country is ruled by Queen Jeanette, and when she meets the charming Maurice she falls for him. They marry, but he finds that (under the guidance of her Prime Minister - Lionel Belmore - and his cabinet) she puts him aside on matters of ruling the state. Chevalier, normally the aggressor in sexual matters and in putting his own ideas out, does not like the self-image of being the boy-toy husband of the ruler of his native country. His idea would be more like that of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, who became her chief adviser on political matters after their marriage. Here, however, while everyone is polite to him, they make it clear that constitutionally he is not to be involved in running the government.\n\nThe film is a charming one - full of those \"Lubitsch touches\". For example, Chevalier's growing anger and impatience at his political uselessness is first shown when he asks one of the courtiers (who has just politely put him in his place), \"Do you understand French?\" \"No, I'm afraid I don't.\", says the courtier. Chevalier, with perfect timing, shoots out a long, furious diatribe of French, which one can tell is gutter language, to show his fury at his position - much to the dismay of the courtier. Later on, when the Prime Minister also puts down Chevalier's attempts at advice, he smiles and asks the Prime Minister, \"Excuse me, but do you speak French?\" Belmore looks at him puzzled, \"Yes I do speak French.\" With an eat dirt smile, Chevalier says, \"What a pity!\" In the end, it is a financial crisis (which with typical Lubitsch humor can only depend on the foreign investors in Sylvanian securities, all of whom have to observe the reactions of the Afghan Ambassador - bearded Russ Powell - to a court function) that gives Chevalier his chance. Chevalier will only show his true love for his wife if she and the cabinet give him a voice in public affairs like Prince Albert had. And they give in.\n\nIt would not be the last visit Hollywood paid to Sylvania. Unlike other Balkan pseudo-states, it actually reappeared four years later, though under more \"sinister\" circumstances. In 1933 the Sylvanian Ambassador to a neighboring country tried to use underhanded means to bring about it's annexation by his homeland. However, Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) did not count upon the Dictator of Freedonia (Rufus T. Firefly - Groucho Marx) and his three brothers to force him to surrender in a barrage of vegetables and fruit in DUCK SOUP.",

When an errant military adjutant is recalled from Paris to face her censure she falls for his charms and he for hers, and they marry. But the Queen's new husband is unhappy in the role of obedient consort. Conflict arises but is eventually resolved, as we know it will be in operetta land. \n\nThis early Lubitsch musical rates about the same as MONTE CARLO made a year later. The highlight here is the performance of Maurice Chevalier as the consort, a sort of pre-Cary Grant Cary Grant, Gallic style. He has the same effortless magnetism and charm and a certain physical resemblance. Jeanette MacDonald is as good here as in MONTE CARLO, handling songs and dialogue with equal aplomb and looking gorgeous in her filmy gowns. As is usual with Lubitsch, there is a superior supporting cast, here including the formidable Lupino Lane as Chevalier's valet, a sassy and brassy Lillian Roth as Lane's love interest and Edgar Norton as the \"Master of Ceremonies,\" the personification of royal lackey. Another Lubitsch hallmark, the measured depiction of ritualistic daily activities, gets much display in the context of the protocols of a royal palace. The songs by Victor Schertzinger and Clifford Grey are only passable and the primitive sound recording doesn't help in getting them across but the tone of the whole enterprise is so frothy and pleasant that one doesn't mind not hearing all of the lyrics. \n\nWhen you compare this film to other musicals from the dawn of the sound era like Broadway MELODY the difference is glaring. Lubitsch's camera is liberated and fluid and we get an assortment of physical approaches to song and dance numbers which themselves vary in style from pompous operetta-military to musical hall slapstick to Gilbert-and- Sullivanesque call-and-repeat choral to intimate romantic duets. There is a hint of LOVE ME TONIGHT in some of the ensemble work, particularly with the palace staff. And the script is studded with witty observations and clever comic constructions, some via dialogue, some through pure visuals. THE LOVE PARADE illustrates that in 1929 Rouben Mamoulian (APPLAUSE) was not alone among film directors in recognizing the value of sound as an artistic element and in refusing to subordinate the freedom of the camera to the dictates of miking.",

As Lubitsch's first sound film, 'The Love Parade' would have closed out the 20's for us. This is my 5th Lubitsch film, and he has yet to disappoint me. Right from the start, Lubitsch has an excellent handle on how to utilize sound, dialogue, and music, but still gets plenty of mileage out of dialogue-free business, such as the opening scene. The two leads spark nearly as much chemistry as they would later in 'Love Me Tonight': Chevalier (in his second sound film) is charming as ever, and Jeanette McDonald (in her first film) is supremely sexy (really!), showing a lot more skin in several scenes than the Hays Code would have likely allowed. I thought the second half of the film lagged quite a bit; once the two are married, it's just a series of scenes of Alfred becoming miserable with his new life, suffering under the soul-crushing set-up of \"many duties and no rights.\" Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth add a lot of cuteness, spunk, and verve to the proceedings as Alfred and Louise's respective sidekicks/hired help; their performance of \"Let's Be Common\" was my favorite musical number of the piece. Judging by his footwork, I'm guessing Lane came off of vaudeville. Although I enjoyed this movie less than the other four Lubitsch comedies I've seen, I still recommend it.\n\nKEVIN: Going back to 1929 we have this royal battle of the sexes, Lubitsch-style! Though not an essential, this movie was definitely worth checking out. The always reliable Maurice Chevalier (in his second sound film), and the lovely singer Jeanette MacDonald (in her first film) star in The Love Parade, Ernst Lubitsch's teasing romantic musical. When a suave ambassador (Chevalier) gets in one too many scandals in his beloved Paris, he returns home to his native Silvania, where he catches the eye of the man-starved queen (MacDonald). But when they wed, he becomes not a king but the \"queen-consort,\" a position with many mundane duties but no responsibilities or power of any kind. That and his lovely new wife is more focused on her queenly duties. Naturally, he finds his new life more than a little unsatisfying. I found the struggle of Chevalier's character to be fresh and appealing, portraying a man who refuses to remain a trophy husband. There were several scenes where it felt as though the gender roles had been reversed, though the scene in the opera house where Chevalier basically taunts MacDonald into submission worried me some. But overall, the irresistible team of Chevalier & Lubitsch definitely met my expectations. The dialogue-free opening scene was a stitch. MacDonald manages to strike the right balance of lovelorn maiden and blue-blooded royal. Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth (who would appear the following year in Animal Crackers) make a great team and provide some fantastic sidekick laughs (and some of the more inventive dance numbers).\n\nLast film viewed: Wings (1927).

                "text": "The Love Parade which was Maurice Chevalier's second feature film is as fresh today as it was in 1929 when it garnered a whole flock of Academy Award nominations. It was Paramount's prestige film of the year, in fact I'm not sure if any other Paramount features got any nominations for anything that year.\n\nIt was Ernst Lubitsch's first sound feature film and apparently the man with the famed Lubitsch touch hit the ground running in the new medium with a bunch of players who were also fresh to cinema because of the coming of sound. This was Jeanette MacDonald's film debut and while she's not billed over the title as Chevalier was, her part is every bit as important and as big as his. \n\nMaurice Chevalier has been cutting a wide swath among the ladies of Paris where he's attached to the embassy of Sylvania. So much so that he's been recalled to Sylvania for a reprimand or so he thinks.\n\nJeanette MacDonald is the new young Queen of Sylvania and she's got to marry for reasons of state. As did many a female monarch, British ones like Victoria, Anne, and the two Marys all took husbands for reasons of state and the method they chose them was as much political as anything else. Only Elizabeth I managed to escape the marriage obligation.\n\nWhile her diplomats look askance on Chevalier's romantic antics, Jeanette sees in him one grand candidate for marriage. If she's got to get married for reasons of state by God she's going to pick a husband who's going to be ready to romp at a royal command.\n\nThe Love Parade's musical score was written by Victor Schertzinger and Clifford Grey. The first notes Jeanette MacDonald ever sang on screen were from her hit song, Dream Lover. It's not the same song as Bobby Darin had a hit in the Fifties from. Film fans will recognize it as the flying theme that Cecil B. DeMille used as background music when Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde were on the trapeze in The Greatest Show On Earth. Jeanette also sings March of the Grenadiers as she reviews her palace guard.\n\nChevalier's two big numbers were Paris Stays The Same and My Love Parade from whence the title comes. Both were written to suit his grand boulevardier style. Some comic numbers were written for Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth who are the second leads. Lupino is Chevalier's orderly and Roth is one of her maids. They make a cute pair with their impish behavior, aping their masters.\n\nThe Love Parade got six Oscar nominations, but did not win in any category and the categories were a lot fewer back in the day. It was up for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Maurice Chevalier, Best Sound Recording, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography. It also has a lot fewer overacted performances that were the norm in those early sound days. It was as if Ernst Lubitsch instinctively knew what to do with sound in film.\n\nThe story is about a Prince Consort and usually the model that is held up is that of Prince Albert for Queen Victoria. But that's not the road Chevalier wants to take. \n\nIt's a continental story and yet Lubitsch as he always did, made those stories appealing to American audiences. After 80 years, The Love Parade is still appealing.",

We're halfway through the first musical Ernst Lubitsch made in Hollywood, and a delight it is. It's Ruritanian operetta, or rather Sylvanian operetta, but it shows what Lubitsch was doing to bring an early Hollywood clich\u00e9 -- musicals filmed with cameras pointed straight at the stage-bound musical numbers -- into what the musicals, influenced by Lubitsch, became. The effervescent and amusing songs, with music by Victor Schertzinger and lyrics by Clifford Grey, for the most part come from the plot. The camera moves fluidly. The actors don't play to the camera except when Lubitsch deliberately has them do so.\n\nMost importantly, the movie is a delight. For a generation or two who uneasily know of Maurice Chevalier only as an old man telling us how much he loves little girls, Chevalier in his prime shows us why he became such an international star. The man is sexy, charming, worldly and likable. He has a self-deprecating sense of humor. His Alfred Renard is a womanizer of the old school\u0085 he doesn't love them and leave them, he loves them and leaves them smiling, as satisfied as he is. Jeannette MacDonald is a revelation for those most familiar with her trilling a song in duet with the wooden Nelson Eddy. She's quite good as a light comedienne and manages to keep Chevalier from overshadowing her.\n\nThe story? Renard is recalled from Paris because of his scandalous doings with wives, maids and duchesses. He returns to Sylvania, where the Queen is prepared not to be amused. But Queen Louise also dreams of having a husband who loves her as a woman, not a Queen. She is beautiful, a bit imperious, and agrees that any husband of hers will not become the king, only a prince consort. And after the two marry, a case it appears of true love, will the Queen be smart enough to distinguish between the role of a prince consort and the role of her husband. And will Alfred be able to teach Louise a thing or two about being a wife as well as a Queen. Well, remember this is an operetta and anything but a happy ending would be awful. In fact, Lubitsch gives us an ending that is a deliberate reverse of the first wooing scene between the Count and the Queen. It is so unexpected, so clever and so affectionate, the only thing you can do is smile in appreciation. \n\nAlong for the story is Alfred's man's man played by Lupino Lane and a maid of the Queen played by Lillian Roth. They have a couple of comic numbers and are first rate, especially Lane. He was a great comic star in England who built into his acts physical business that might make the Nicholas Brothers envious. (And he also was Ida Lupino's uncle.)\n\nThe Love Parade is pre-Code. That's another way of saying that, as a Lubitsch film, it's naughty and sophisticated. With the Count and the Queen, sex is as much a part of love as a kiss. You might have one without the other, but it wouldn't be half as much fun.",

                "text": "This is Ernst Lubitsch's first sound film and technically speaking, it's amazing. While the sound technology of the time was VERY primitive, Lubitsch was able to make the first really modern looking musical--with natural movements and a story that is NOT just another Gold Diggers sort of extravaganza (quite the rage at the time). Reading through the trivia on IMDb, I saw that it was the first or among the first musicals to be filmed this way--and that this was done by ignoring the speakers and re-dubbing the film after it was completed! All I know is that compared to other musicals of the day, it stands up very, very well---even if the singing of Jeanette MacDonald (in her first film) is a bit dated stylistically.\n\n\"The Love Parade\" starts out with a wonderfully clever scene that illustrates what a cool and confident lover Maurice Chevalier plays in this film. I could say more about it, but really think you need to see it. Chevalier's antics in Paris cause some problems with officials from his home country, Sylvania, and he is ordered back home to answer for his sexual shenanigans. However, instead of being punished, he meets the Queen (MacDonald) and the two soon fall in love--complete with LOTS of singing.\n\nConsidering how pretty and sweet MacDonald is, you'd think that Chevalier would be ecstatic when they marry. Well, that is NOT the case at all as he has nothing to do and no power. In essence, he's like a royal trophy husband. And, to make matters worse, MacDonald does just about everything she can to keep him emasculated. So, it's not at all a surprise when he walks. Can their love be rekindled or are they destined for separate lives? \n\nI will freely admit that this is not a perfect film or even close to it if you compare it to modern films---or even musicals from just a few years later. However, for 1929, it's just about perfect--exceptional in every way. So, if you can understand and appreciate the groundbreaking nature of the film, you'll no doubt enjoy it. Though, you will wonder why the Queen and her Consort have such amazingly different accents considering they both are Sylvanians! \n\nI noticed that Lupino Lane played Chevalier's funny butler. He did a great job in the film and it's one of the small number of sound films in which he appeared. Believe it or not, he was a prolific silent comedian--and a very funny one. You get a hint of this in the VERY physical song he and the maid perform at 65 minutes into the movie. I have seen him in a few of his silent films and can recommend you see one if you get the chance. In addition, silent comic Ben Turpin also makes a short cameo appearance.",

But The Love Parade still does manage as well to be, apart from some primitive sound quality, a great film and compares favourable within Lubitsch's mostly consistent(in a good way) filmography.\n\nThe costumes and sets in The Love Parade are wonderfully opulent and the photography is very stylishly done. Lubitsch's distinctive style is evident all through the film, bringing a huge amount of class, subtlety and elegance. What he also did brilliantly was making camera and sound effects more flexible counterpointing the music numbers, and also even for his first sound picture having a technical mastery already with apparently having two sets built for one number shot simultaneously with the orchestra off screen between the two sets, going back and forth in the editing, something that had never been done before. The songs are very pleasant and memorable at least, with the beautiful and catchy duet My Love Parade, the charmingly intimate Dream Lover and the hugely entertaining Let's Be Common faring the best. The choreography's elegant and poised and in other places witty and inventive, the highlight number in this regard being Let's Be Common.\n\nThe script was one of my favourite things about The Love Parade, it was very sophisticated and deliciously witty, particularly funny was the writing regarding the Count's political uselessness. There's even some sexual innuendo that was very ahead of its time back in 1929. The story is full of immense charm and sophisticated style with a seductive edge, not ever making the mistake of being dull or improbable(and if it did really it would not be as glaring as the story in Monte Carlo). The characters are very likable and the performances from all four leads do not disappoint at all. Noteworthy especially were MacDonald whose screen debut was a revelation being both sexy and regal and singing like an angel and Lupino Lane whose incredible physical comedy is enough to make one seethe with envy. Sassy Lillian Roth sparkles as Lane's partner and Chevalier is the epitome of Gallic warmth and charm. The chemistry between him and MacDonald beguiles and for two relatively different singing styles they blend remarkably well when singing together.\n\nOverall, a great film. While I may prefer The Merry Widow, Heaven Can Wait, The Shop Around the Corner and especially Trouble in Paradise over The Love Parade it is unsurprising that The Love Parade was a huge hit at the time and still wins over people now. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

He needed someone who was young, could sing and dance, look regal enough to be a Queen but ravishing enough to wear a skimpy nightgown. He had almost decided on Bebe Daniels but then saw a screen test of a former chorus girl who had been bought to Hollywood as a discovery of Richard Dix - Jeanette MacDonald. Her work consisted of a couple of second rate Broadway shows but with Lubitsch to guide her, she was perfection!!!\n\nWith champagne bottles, the Eiffel Tower and dancing showgirls as a montage, the scene is set in Paris as dashing playboy Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier) has a narrow escape from the husband of his latest mistress - \"She's terribly jealous\" Chevalier says, in a typical audience aside. He and his loyal valet (Lupino Lane) bid adieu to Paris \"Paris, Still Stay the Same\", as the song is carried on by his score of female admirers - even the dogs have a chorus!!!\n\nMeanwhile in Sylvania, beautiful Queen Louise (Jeanette MacDonald) is awakened from her sleep - \"Why am I always awakened from my dreams?\" - sweet lady-in-waiting (Virginia Bruce) asks \"What did my lady dream?\" That is Jeanette's cue to sing the beautiful \"Dream Lover\". The song takes her from her opulent bed to her bath!!! The most pressing concern for the country is the Queen's matrimonial state - she, for one, is sick of it!!! The Castle Band is forever playing the Wedding March!! The problem is the groom would only be a Prince Consort and not a King - and no red blooded male wants to take it on!!\n\nAlfred goes back to his home in Sylvania and when Louise meets him she is not impressed - until she reads the accounts of all his scandalous affairs - together they sing \"Anything to Please the Queen\". At dinner that night Alfred sings of his \"Love Parade\" of women, but that she has the charms of them all, rolled into one - \"the eyes of Dauphine, smile of Josephine\"!! The next scene is the marriage and Louise is absolutely gorgeous in one of the longest trains ever, but the ceremony is causing Alfred second thoughts - he wants his manhood back!!! Marriage proves tough for Alfred - Louise has her engagements during the day, she arranges tennis and bridge for Alfred, plus an afternoon nap \"to keep up his strength\"!! His valet is finding life more harmonious with Lulu (lively Lillian Roth) - they do a comic song and dance to \"Let's Be Common\" - one of the highlights of this wonderful movie. \n\nAlfred is so frustrated - he even sings a song about it - \"Nobody's Using Now\". In his spare time he has drawn up a budget to help the troubled country stay solvent but because he is only a Prince Consort his plans are not considered. When he is told that Sylvania is going ahead with a loan but it all depends on his behaviour during a night at the ballet - he takes a stand!! He walks into the performance late and amid cheers and claps manages to upstage Louise. Now the roles are reversed and Louise has a humiliating night as Alfred at last gets his manhood back!!\n\nThis is a dazzling film from the first scene of Lupino Lane deftly swishing a tablecloth out from under a set table as he sings \"Champagne\". The songs could almost tell the story on their own, each song was essential to the plot - unlike the Operetta tradition of the time which had characters bursting into song for no reason. There was also fluid camera movement ie when Victor Milmer sweeps his camera over the elaborate wedding and ballet sequences. Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth make a riotous \"common\" couple and compliment the more regal pair. Among the \"Lubitsch touches\" - an American tour group are driven through the beautiful Sylvania and are clearly not interested - however when they hear that the income is over $100,000,000 a year - they are all agog!! Silent comedian Ben Turpin also makes a cameo appearance as a crosseyed messenger - supposedly unlucky for Alfred!!!\n\nHighly, Highly Recommended.",

The early sound features could appear stilted and static, but with songs to carry the narrative along, the new medium could really come into its own.\n\nIt's sometimes been claimed that there were no \"integrated\" musicals - the ordinary-people-bursting-into-song type - before the 1940s. This is of course nonsense as any 30s musical buff should know, and in fact The Love Parade is the first example of such on the screen. But the tradition is older still, and this picture is only really a cinematic update of the operetta, a popular stage format most often associated with Europe. Appropriately enough The Love Parade has a light-hearted tone and Ruritanian backdrop, and is helmed by that most Ruritanian of directors, Mr Ernst Lubitsch. But this being the \"pre-code\" era, and Lubitsch being his usual sly self, it is also a rather modern and uninhibited affair. In this world, bed-hopping is the norm and marriage is the exception. It's all conveyed with crackling wit and subtlety, from the cheeky dialogue of Guy Bolton and Ernest Vajda (such as Chevalier's illegitimate descent from royalty being described as \"from a good family\") and Lubitsch's own smart little constructions with the implied rather than the stated.\n\nIn many ways The Love Parade harks back to Lubitsch's Berlin comedies from a decade earlier. It is filled with many of the absurd visual gags that characterised the director's German output, such as the unfeasibly large heap of apple cores that Chevalier has amassed during his garden sulk. It may be that with the coming of sound, Lubitsch was being careful to keep things image-based and not let too much verbal humour slow the story down. Whether or not this is the case, these silly sight gags are very welcome. Certainly, in the earliest scenes there seems to be a deliberate reference to this still being a primarily visual comedy. Even for viewers who don't speak French, the opening routine is very funny. Chevalier's occasional English asides, addressed directly to the camera, function like intertitles.\n\nBut the aim here is not to pretend the sound revolution isn't going on. After all, this is a musical! The Love Parade in fact makes the most of sound. We are treated to the heavenly melodies of composer Victor Schertzinger, who oddly enough had a day job as a film director. Lubitsch does not shoot the musical numbers with as much zip as Rouben Mamoulian would for the sublime Love Me Tonight, but he nevertheless shows some musical sensibilities, keeping the camera back when a song swells up, and showing off each character's performance within the song as if it were a dance.\n\nAnd of course with the coming of sound we get a wave of sound-friendly stars. Maurice Chevalier did not have the voice of a crooner, but he was a true performer. With superb control over his movements, inventive little twitches and fluorishes that make him uniquely interesting, and impeccable comic timing, he is like a cartoon character come to life. He is absolutely enchanting to watch and listen to. Jeanette MacDonald is more in the vein of an opera singer, and as such while her voice is beautiful her words are hard to pick out. Still, she can certainly act, and has the comedienne's touch, playing the queen as a spoiled little girl, a little like Miranda Richardson as Elizabeth I in Blackadder. It's just a pity, what with the misogynist plot, her character doesn't have the authority of Elizabeth. Chevalier's prince consort could do with being reminded of what happened to the Earl of Essex.\n\nAnd let us not forget the supporting roles played by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth. These two clowns are a delight to watch, although they do highlight the lack of confidence producers had in these early days of sound. The tendency was to turn these early talkies into a kind of variety show, packing diversions in between the chunks of plot. I don't begrudge Lupino and Roth's appearance because they are great entertainers who are now rarely seen, but their inclusion seems somewhat tacked on (Roth, despite playing the queen's maid, appears in no scenes with MacDonald) and Chevalier and MacDonald could easily have carried the picture unaided. Lubitsch and co. would realise this, and successive Paramount musicals are shorter and more streamlined, with just a little more substance.",

First - and perhaps foremost - the songs were integrated into the action and the plot beautifully. Unlike so many other \"talkathons\" of the time in which the camera stares at the characters' mouths all the time, we follow the characters as they go about their lives normally - while singing at the same time! Lubitsch didn't miss a step here. And although the two quite different styles of singing were in deep contrast, so were the characters! Although the country was about to be invaded by a Puritanical \"Code\" a bit later - and Prohibition in full swing - the film is in no way whatsoever crude or lewd. Neither was its director who could show more action filming a closed door than most others could depict in an entire film. I enjoyed this romp very much.",

                "text": "While I've previously seen the original To Be or Not to Be, part of me feels this might have been the first time I've seen a real Ernst Lubitsch film. That's because this one was made before the Production Code of 1934 that forbid certain material from being depicted for several decades was put into effect. So we get to see what the Maurice Chevalier character did to humiliate himself in the beginning scenes before being teamed romantically with the Queen of a fictional country. She's played by Jeanette MacDonald in her film debut. And while we don't hear anything graphic, it's quite clear what kind of material Ms. MacDonald is reading when she looks at the past exploits of Chevalier in her manuscript. This was another early talkie, in fact Lubitsch's first, that didn't have the stilted quality of many of those other ones made at this period and reading that this was shot silent first before the voices and sound were post-dubbed was fascinating to read on this site. While it took awhile, I did warm to the kind of give-and-take of the two leads though I felt the picture really came to life when the help, played by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth, were doing their own slapstick numbers in remarkable contrast to the more dignified singing of Chevalier and MacDonald though Chevalier himself also provided some lively moments both during his numbers and some of his solo scenes as well as those with Ms. MacDonald. Oh, and reading this was the first integrated movie musical was also a fascinating find for me since for the past several weeks, I've been reviewing this genre of movies in chronological order in order to prepare for the current release of the latest-Les Miserables. So on that note, The Love Parade was interesting to watch both historically and entertainment-wise.",

Mainly because in the last three decades it's never been shown on UK TV; their schedules are so packed with indispensable brilliant TV they couldn't find an empty 2 hour slot. Is it worth looking up? Well yes, it's a fascinating early talkie/musical, very redolent of the future Trouble In Paradise and One Hour With You (and Love Me Tonight), with lavish sets, sumptuous d\u00e9cor and elegant costumes and a bearable plot and music.\n\nThe Queen of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) with her many ministers urging is keen to get married, Count Alfred (Maurice Chevalier) blows in fresh from life and death romantic scandals in Paris and they fall for one another. Except that he eventually objects to being her Poodle Consort... There are quite a few pretty forgettable songs the best by miles being the title song which is reprised twice, although slapstick music hall artist Lupino Lane also gets to sing a witty ditty with Lillian Roth as butler and maid respectively. Mustachioed minister Eugene Palette's voice never sounded so razor-like! It's continually charming and witty in Lubitsch's best style, acting and singing fresh and stilted at the same time, interesting and even riveting in places \u0096 the print and sound are in fine condition considering it was made in 1929. By the way, does this mean that a few years later the Queen appointed dirty-necked Trentino (Louis Calhern) as Sylvanian Ambassador to Freedonia for Duck Soup?!\n\nIt's not Trouble In Paradise - nothing is, and at nearly 2 hours long it has a lot of padding to it, but as it opens up such a completely different and lovely world to us now it's well worth watching.",

That's what newleywed royal Maurice Chevalier wants to know as he is told by his wife (Queen of Sylvania) how to spend his day, then reminded to \"rest\" for obvious reasons. Originally, he was just to be her military attach\u00e9, to accompany her as a sort of bodyguard/companion, a la Queen Guenevere's \"Take Me to the Fair\" in \"Camelot\". Because of a rather sordid reputation (having been evicted from Paris after being discovered with a married woman), MacDonald begins to see Chevalier more as a baby maker than her companion, and what the throne needs is a male heir. No longer \"The Virgin Queen\", MacDonald goes about her daily royal duties while Chevalier is idle day after day.\n\nMacDonald's film debut is a total triumph, and made her a movie star. Chevalier, too, was new to Hollywood, and this was the first of four pairings for the two. There are arguments over whether Chevalier or Nelson Eddy was a better screen co-star, and I must pick Chevalier. This early talkie movie musical helped advance the technology of sound, and show only a slight creakiness. The extremely lavish production is helped by comic performances by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth who steal the film with their comic duet \"Let's Be Common\".\n\nThis film is remarkably feminist for its time. Chevalier's impish performance is a boyish wink at the audience of how he'll work things out, and MacDonald's womanly wiles could do more than the league of Nations tried and failed to do after World War I. It has a wonderfully witty screenplay that holds up extremely well more than 80 years later.",

                "text": "When Criterion released its Lubitsch Musicals set a few years ago, I watched and really loved the other three films, and meant to get around to a second viewing of The Love Parade. I failed to do that until now. Well, it's awesome. The best of those four films, and that's saying a Hell of a lot. This rivals my favorite Lubitsch film, Trouble in Paradise. He was one director who really understood right away how to use sound. This was his first talkie, and most consider it the first musical where the songs drive the plot, instead of the classic revue/Broadway show type of musical like The Broadway Melody or The Hollywood Revue of 1929, both of which were so impressive to people at the time that they were nominated for Best Picture (with The Broadway Melody winning, of course). The Love Parade was also nominated, but not until the next year, since it didn't get a Los Angeles release until January of 1930 (and it lost, of course, to All Quiet on the Western Front). Maurice Chevalier plays a philandering count who gets kicked out of Paris. He retreats to his homeland of Sylvania, whose queen (Jeanette MacDonald, in her film debut) is being pressured to marry by her cabinet (it will look good and perhaps convince other countries to give them loans). Chevalier isn't the marrying kind, but the queen is all kinds of beautiful, so he relents. Unfortunately, his new position holds no power whatsoever - he's a mere figurehead - and it upsets his male pride. This is an absolutely charming film. Chevalier and MacDonald are both hilarious, as are all the other characters (their servants, played by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth, who have a romance of their own, are particularly wonderful), the European royalty settings are gorgeous to look at and the songs are great. The only minor problem is that occasionally, given the primitive recording techniques, some of the dialogue and songs can be difficult to understand. Still, a masterpiece.",

It's a silly affair as most musicals of the day were but this being pre-code director Lubitsch takes every opportunity to invoke sexual innuendo and keep Ms. McDonald in diaphanous negligees.\n\nMuch to the disappointment of her ministers Queen Louise of Sylvania is resigned to the fact she will never find a suitable husband. Enter Count Renard who may not be suitable for affairs of state but irresistible in affairs of love. They marry and the free range rogue is quickly fenced in an ordered to act properly with his new title and responsibilities by Louise who pulls rank on him. Renaud soon begins to chafe at the trappings of royalty and what he sees as amounting to role reversal and decides to walk. Such a scandal could rock Sylvania to its foundation. A desperate Louise attempts to balance both issues without offending chauvinist Renaud's already wounded manhood.\n\nInane as place and premise may be Lubitsh keeps things racy throughout while taking satiric pokes at societal hypocrisy and royal obsequiousness. He magnifies and compares the royal duo's predicament of maintaining decorum and propriety while the help, energetically and acrobatically performed by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth, in unabashed declaration announce it's great to be a commoner.\n\nThe set design and the cinematography by Victor Milner gives the film a 14 carat opulence and Mo and Mac look dashing and ravishing most of the time in uniform and gown which allows this fairy tale of a musical to play itself out whimsically and seductively courtesy of Lubitsch's deft touch.",

The camera is perfectly content to sit for minutes at a time on one take while one or two people warble out a tune. No doubt the sound of that tune was enough to engage the interest of the audience watching the movie, and they didn't really need anything else.\n\nIt's that quality that makes \"The Love Parade\" an interesting historical document but an ever-so-slightly-dull film. The pacing is sluggish and the movie is far too long for the little plot it has to get through -- that's not a complaint I would ever level against one of Lubitsch's films from the late 1930s or 40s.\n\nMaurice Chevalier and Jeannette MacDonald make a winning pair, even if Chevalier's continental finesse too often comes across as effeminate. The plot is enough to turn a modern-day audience's hair on end: MacDonald plays a queen who's punished by the film for asserting her authority and only finds happiness when she allows her new husband to take control. But this was 1929, so let's not be too harsh on it.\n\nTwo of the film's mostly unknown (to me anyway) supporting actors, Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth, steal the show with a frisky comedy number in which Lane gets a chance to show off his acrobatic skills.\n\nOverall a rather boring film, but not in an unenjoyable way, if that makes any sense.

MGM tosses in some guests stars like William Haines, Robert Montgomery, Lionel Barrymore, Dorothy Sebastian, Karl Dane, Gwen Lee, John Miljan, William Collier, and directors like Fred Niblo and Cecl B. DeMille, who chats up yes men about his future leading lady: Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Marion Davies, or Bebe Daniels. Lots of MGM name dropping and studio in jokes. Keaton is actually very good in his transition to sound, but the film meanders away and around the bend. He's surprisingly good in a dance number with an excellent young woman (is she Marion Shilling?) to \"Free and Easy,\" which I like more every time I see it. Keaton could DANCE! And Ann Dvorak is in the chorus. Friganza steals several scenes. Page is beautiful. Montgomery gets his voice dubbed in a singing number. Niblo is hilarious as himself, but Buster Keaton, the great and wonderful silent comic, is the reason to watch Free and Easy. He's funny and light and tragic all at once. Was there anyone EVER like Buster Keaton? Around the time of filming he was being screwed by ex-wife Natalie Talmadge and her family as well as by MGM--the same studio that screwed William Haines, John Gilbert, Lillian Gish, Bessie Love, Anita Page and scores of others. See this film. Give it a chance and just watch BUSTER KEATON.",

He appears to be sufficiently alert, however the producer and writers have given him nothing to work with and there is clearly no opportunity for his trademark expertise at improvisation. Sad-eyed Buster's excessively shrill nemesis is a stage mother from Hell who steals all of their scenes together through sheer brute force by overacting, rendering Mr. Keaton's character pathetic and perpetually downtrodden. Then again, the viewer is also subjected to Robert Montgomery crooning so there really is plenty of blame to go around here from a production standpoint. Nevertheless, this is an important movie that features unique and valuable insights into Hollywood soon after the industry's changeover to sound. Billy Haines appears in a cameo as himself and he says a few words before wending his way down to the reserved seating section far forward in the Grauman's Chinese Theater--and the camera follows him! The POV includes panoramic scenes of the interior, as well as a close-up look at the Red Carpet outside of the theater as the glamorous stars of the day drove up, alighted from their magnificent cars and had a few words to say into the microphone before heading inside, framed by shots of the crowd that has gathered outside to witness the spectacle. Jackie Coogan is featured here as himself, and the story soon shifts to the MGM Studio where we are afforded further behind-the-scenes eyefuls of a sound stage with all the trappings, outbuildings, gated entrances and eavesdropping on the likes of Fred Niblo and Cecil B. DeMille as they candidly discuss Garbo, Crawford and Shearer! I have always prized MGM's The Jean Harlow Story, starring Jean Harlow--er, make that BOMBSHELL for the unique and rare glimpses that it provides of the Metro-Golden-Mayer studio circa 1933, but this movie was made three years earlier and the storyline is set at the studio. It is therefore particularly instructive for anyone who is similarly intrigued by sustained peeks at real, undesigning people and authentic settings of historical significance in Hollywood from some of the earliest days of its glorious Golden Age. There is some vintage lightning in a bottle here in this Keaton clunker, for anyone who cares to a take a look.",

                "text": "As a twist on the old 'innocent makes it big in the movies' theme, it's not a bad plot: a pretty blonde beauty queen from a sleepy provincial town comes to Hollywood in the chance of a lifetime... only, instead of Elvira winding up as a star, it is her Olympian harridan of a mother and incompetent booby of a would-be manager who end up with contracts -- as comic relief.\n\nTrixie Friganza provides a wonderful performance as the stage-door mother from hell, with the bonus of some very attractive costume routines in the film-within-a-film. Anita Page is naive and sweetly shy as the unambitious Elvira, establishing sympathy and character in a relatively small part. Robert Montgomery is competent but unremarkable as the caddish movie star she falls for, and who ultimately repents and offers her the prize of every good girl's virtue: marriage.\n\nBut the question one is inevitably left asking concerns the casting of Buster Keaton as 'Elmer Butts', the shambling idiot. Nominally, this is a \"Buster Keaton Production\"; but in fact, his character is probably the biggest reason not to watch it, since most of the time Elmer is just embarrassing. Once you hide 'the great stone face' under sad-clown makeup, so that he can't use it to act with, and conceal the trained grace and expression of his body under tent-like trousers or padded tights, so that he can't act with that either, and then give him semi-moronic dialogue to recite so that he can't even act with his voice -- you have to ask yourself: why hire the talents of Keaton, of all people, in the first place? \n\nPresumably, given a scene in which the character gets repeatedly hit in the face and flung to the ground by a succession of muscular ladies, it helps if you employ an actor who can take a fall without getting hurt. Keaton manages to work in a few trademark variations on the basic tumble during this tedious sequence, and elsewhere in the film there are a couple of acrobatic moments of note: when Elmer launches himself straight into a horizontal tackle at neck-height at Elvira's seducer, and the illusory dive into a shallow tank of water. In the final dance sequence he forgets to shamble, and gives us a glimpse of crisp vaudeville steps despite the obliterating handicap of the costume. Otherwise, the part doesn't appear to demand his particular skills at all.\n\nThe song and dance numbers raised a few -- I suspect not all intentional -- laughs, but tended to drag, an ongoing problem. Many of the dialogue scenes outstay their welcome, including the seduction sequence with its repeated cuts back to the chase, and almost all Elmer's allegedly amusing stand-up exchanges: I suspect you could shorten at least ten minutes out of this film and it would only be an improvement.\n\nComedy-wise, it's effective from time to time. I was surprised into a few genuine laughs, including a couple where Keaton gets to slip in a dry sotto-voce aside -- an acting style that would clearly have suited him much better than the verbose mumbling and misunderstandings he has to labour through in this script. I'm not familiar enough with Buster Keaton's voice to tell how much of the slurred delivery here was produced for 'comic' effect and how much was his natural vocal range... but frankly, in a number of scenes he sounds quite simply drunk, an effect that can't possibly have been wanted! \n\nThe ending, meanwhile, appears to lack effective resolution, and left me somewhat up in the air as to what message it was supposed to convey. Elvira marries her actor, as Elmer's stumbling attempts to confess his own love inadvertently contrive to bring together the estranged pair; but the film, mis-paced as ever, doesn't end at this point. Instead Elvira, still innocently unaware of Elmer's feelings for her, kisses him in gratitude, laughs at him, and sends him back out in front of the cameras to be comic (which, as ever, he fails in any noticeable degree to achieve)... and then we have yet another musical number, with the two love-birds caught up in each other's eyes, and Keaton just standing there immobile, grotesquely painted and (presumably) heartbroken.\n\nIs it supposed to be funny? Is it trying for some ironic depth hitherto unheralded by the rest of the film? Are we supposed to feel sorry for Elmer -- and if so, just what sort of a comedy ending is that? \n\n(Plus, an unpalatable point: if one of your actors has a mutilated forefinger, then don't have him fidgeting with the stump throughout in the foreground of a dialogue scene! In Buster's own films, spot-the-finger is an endearing game to be played by those in the know, with a complicit wink; here, it's painfully obvious.)\n\nThere were moments, at the beginning, when I thought this film might have potential; it was never going to be a classic, but it might have been an unpretentious contemporary spoof. The script needs tightening up throughout, often wasting its laughs by labouring the point instead of cutting out a line or two in favour of a reaction shot. But the outcome is basically doomed from the moment that the plot starts dressing the miscast Keaton up: he might just have carried Elmer off as a deadpan role in ordinary clothing, but in third-rate pier end farce he hasn't got a hope. And no amount of proclaiming on screen that the result is the biggest thing in comedy is going to help.",

It worked fine for Glenn Hunter on stage and Stu Erwin on the screen. The lead in Free And Easy was a part that was perfect for Eddie Cantor. But Buster Keaton got it and it wasn't quite right for him.\n\nKeaton, known in Hollywood as the Great Stone Face, was one of the greatest pantomimists the screen ever knew. Why you would star someone in a film that has musical numbers, though you would not classify it as a musical is beyond me. That title song which Keaton croaks would have been perfect for Eddie Cantor.\n\nIn watching it I thought I recognized the plot of this film. It was part of the story line of Pepe, the great Cantinfas all star production from thirty years later. Keaton is in love with young Anita Page who is the young screen hopeful from his home town. But she's got eyes for the flawed young movie star Robert Montgomery.\n\nLike Pepe, a number of folks on the MGM lot made guest appearances as themselves. One of the most interesting was William Haines who at that time competing with Robert Montgomery for juvenile parts. Haines of course was one of the first film stars outted as gay and his fall was a lucky break for Montgomery's career.\n\nBest in the film is Trixie Friganza, a great vaudeville star who played Page's number. She really harries and harasses poor Keaton. Page has won some kind of contest and for reasons I can't explain the Chamber of Commerce of their hometown has appointed Keaton as her agent and manager.

                "text": "In 1928 Buster Keaton was convinced to sign a contract with MGM in which they would produce his films. As the first film under this contract was THE CAMERAMAN, which is a good Keaton film, it seemed to be a good idea. But Keaton's key man at M-G-M was Joseph Schenck, his brother-in-law. Schenck died. The head of M-G-M, Louis B. Mayer, never liked comedians, whom he felt were there to just be funny with whatever material they were given. As Keaton had family problems (his wife would take away his children in a messy divorce) and a growing drinking problem did not endear Mayer to him at all.\n\nKeaton had specific ideas about the use of sound in movies - he felt that most films were too talky (he was right), and talking should be used sparingly. Sound effects were a better idea. But by 1929 all the leading stars in Hollywood (exceptions included Keaton, Lloyd, Chaplin, Garbo, and Lon Chaney Sr.) had started to turn towards talking films. Some with disastrous results - one, by the way, in this film. Keaton had no problem with his voice (a kind of flat baritone), but it was not something that really added to his planned zaniness. \n\nMayer could hardly care for Keaton's feelings. He gave him the script for FREE AND EASY as his entry into sound movies. Typically for Mayer he gave Keaton a lousy comedy, with an oddly sad ending.\n\nThroughout his M-G-M films in the early 1930s, Keaton was saddled with characters with the same first name: Elmer. Here he was Elmer Butts, from Gopher City, Kansas. He is sent by that town's chamber of commerce to be the agent for the winner of a beauty contest, Anita Page (as Elvira Plunkett). This leads poor Buster into repeated collisions with Page's battle ax of a mother (Ma Plunkett - played by Trixie Friganza),who liked other overly ambitious star-making mothers (\"Mama Rose\" in GYPSY comes to mind) can't understand why Elmer is there at all.\n\nOn the train to California Elvira meets Larry Mitchell (Robert Montgomery), one of the leading stars at M-G-M. He is quite interested in the young woman, though honorably or not is up in the air (at this time Montgomery played mostly fashionable cads or weaklings in his films). He invites the trio to see the shooting of his current film at M-G-M. It is a costume musical set in a \"Ruritanian\" setting.\n\nI won't go into all the details of the improbable script here. Keaton does have a few opportunities to show his put-upon situations (looking for a parking spot while he misses a Hollywood premiere he's been invited to); demolishing several film sets and shootings under directors Fred Niblo and Lionel Barrymore, as well as involving him with such figures as actor John Miljan and comedian Karl Dane*. He also tries to influence a less than interested Cecil B. De Mille in his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. And such luminaries as Jackie Coogan, William Haines, and William Collier Sr. pop up at the premiere.\n\n(*When I mentioned \"disastrous results\" due to the coming of sound, I had poor Dane in mind - he eventually shot himself when his once high career as a film comic went under due to his thick Danish accent.)\n\nHe's wasted - positively wasted as a seasoning for the wretched plot about whether Montgomery really loves Page beyond a pretty evening of sex. In the end the audience knows Keaton does love Page (despite her mother), but is too shy to fully come out and say it. Instead, in the final moments of a film that is comic, Keaton's heart is left broken (with a degree of irony as he is dressed up like a clown). It is the oddest ending of any film he ever appeared in.\n\nHe does sing (two songs - one being the title song which is also a dance). So does Montgomery, whose singing is adequate and no more (it also weakens the film - why waste a star in singing in some ridiculous musical?). \n\nI give the film a total of \"6\" because I am a fan of Buster Keaton and of Robert Montgomery, and it gives one a rare opportunity to see all those other film figures like Niblo, Barrymore, DeMille, Coogan, Miljan, Haines, Dane,and Collier. I also feel the rest of the film cast is trying (note too the dependable Ed Brophy, as Niblo's assistant who is fed up with Keaton).

And it is indeed a wreck -- the wreck of Buster Keaton's career.\n\nBuster Keaton liked to take a strong beginning and ending and let the middle work itself out as he and his crew played with the sets and props. \"Free and Easy\" provides a premise Buster could have worked with: Bungling hayseed Elmer Butz is assigned to manage the Hollywood career of hopeful prairie blossom Miss Gopher City (a girl he secretly loves), but she is actually an unassuming and modest maiden being pushed by her battle-axe of a stage mother. The ending -- in which Buster gets a Hollywood contract but loses the girl -- was a departure from typical Keaton, but as we saw in \"Cops,\" losing the girl was something Keaton could twist into a dark, shuddering laugh. There was plenty there for Keaton to work with. It's a shame nobody let him.\n\nAt every turn, the Keaton fan sees missed opportunities, starting with the opening scene in which Elmer ends up on the caboose of a train. Only in the perverse machinations of the MGM system could Buster Keaton + Train = Zilch. It's like presenting Chico Marx with a piano but not letting him touch a single key. MGM didn't even milk Keaton + Train - Stunts = Zilch for the irony. It's as if they were totally unaware that Buster had ever done a thing with trains in his entire career.\n\nThe chase -- which critics inexplicably single out as somehow a bit of gold this celluloid junk heap -- falls totally flat. MGM never really allows Keaton to run, dodge, or leap. The guard who is chasing him, in fact, gets the two most vivid physical moments. The idea of Buster Keaton being pursued through a movie studio was ripe with possibilities, but instead each of the scenes he stumbles into is over-elaborately set up when an economy of set-up would have been funnier, completely breaking the rhythm and pace of what could have been an exciting, exhilarating romp in Buster's able hands.\n\nThen there's the matter of Buster himself. Not only is his nimble, athletic body not put to much use, it's obscured in padded tights and enormous clown pants. Though Buster dances adeptly in the contrived musical scene, the costume obscures and upstages his performance. In another move that leaves the viewer wondering if anybody at MGM had actually watched Buster's silent work, his richly but subtly expressive face is obscured with bizarre makeup, effectively obliterating his large, soulful eyes right at the most potentially poignant part of the entire film, in which he inadvertently delivers the girl he loves into the arms of his rival. \n\nKeaton manages to slip in a few tiny moments -- catching his hat behind his back when it falls off, skidding to a bemused stop when he momentarily shakes his pursuers -- but virtually every other possibility slips by unexploited. The mind boggles at the sheer scale of the gap between what MGM made and what Keaton could have done with the same raw material.\n\nThe finale involves turning Keaton into an enormous clown puppet, jerked about by thick, unbreakable strings. As biographer Edward McPherson noted, \"the story concerns a man who goes to MGM, is made into a misunderstood clown, then has his heart broken.\" \"Free and Easy\" could serve as a tragic metaphorical documentary about Keaton's career.",

His hangdog, sadsack expression never alters - and I don't think he was acting! \n\nI must say I was surprised that Buster didn't get the girl in the end.

But no, the cad reforms and somehow we're supposed to believe they fell in love sometime when the cameras weren't on them or something. What the heck?

Chaplin, wisely, did not jump into talkies--choosing to take his time making his kind of pictures. As a result, his first sound film, CITY LIGHTS, is considered a classic. Harold Lloyd made some very, very good sound films but the public reaction was surprisingly rather underwhelming (FEET FIRST and MOVIE CRAZY were wonderful and should be remembered). Of the big three silent comedians, Buster Keaton made, in hindsight, the worst career moves at this time--allowing MGM to put him into vehicles that in no way played to his strengths as a comedian. \n\nIn this film, FREE AND EASY, much of the film is a musical!!! A musical for a wonderful visual and very physical comedian?! And, unfortunately, it got much worse during the 1930s--as MGM paired him with Jimmy Durante--who the the complete opposite of Keaton in every way. Keaton was quiet, sweet and physically adept, while Durante was loud, brash and just plain annoying! Why, oh why did Keaton allow this to happen?! Why did VERBAL humor come to predominate in his films when this was by far his weakest point as an actor? Oh, I guess I should stop complaining and just address this film. \n\nFREE AND EASY was a very odd film because unlike his earlier starring roles, he was just one of many characters in the film and far less of the movie's focus was on him. Instead, a plot involving Anita Page (as \"Miss Gopher Falls\") and her mother as they travel to Hollywood is the main thrust of the film--and Keaton is just along for the ride. Later, naturally, the film involves much more of Keaton, but for about the first third, he was definitely a secondary character.\n\nWhen in Hollywood, Miss Page met up with an aspiring young actor (Robert Montgomery--who, unlike the other Hollywood stars and directors does NOT play himself but a fictional star). This part of the film I liked best, as there were may behind the scenes clips where you got to see some great actors in seemingly casual scenes (such as William Haines, Lionel Barrymore and Jackie Coogan). Additionally, super-important directors like Fred Niblo (who directed many of the great early MGM films) and Cecil B. DeMille were on hand. Unfortunately, while these scenes were very interesting to film fans like myself, they weren't all that funny.\n\nAs for the rest of the film, it was very disappointing because there just weren't many laughs. Plus, placing Keaton in the musical portion was sad indeed. His Pagliacci-style character with sad makeup just seemed pathetic and overly based in pathos--which was Chaplin's style, not Keaton's. The ending was in many ways also a knockoff of Chaplin's THE CIRCUS, as Keaton professes his love but loses the girl. To make matters worse, this wasn't set up well at all--and his confession seemed to come completely out of left field.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film was NOT Keaton but was like another person stuck in Buster's body.

Nearly 80 years on it is not funny but very sad. For the first time Buster didn't end up with the girl (and I so hoped he would). Even though he was the star, he ended up as Robert Montgomery's amiable side kick. On the plus side it is an invaluable look at Hollywood life behind the scenes.\n\nElvira Plunkett (the beautiful Anita Page, who didn't have much to do) has won a \"Miss Gopher Prairie\" beauty contest and is on her way to make good in Hollywood, along with her battleaxe mother (Trixie Friganza). Elmer Butts (Buster Keaton) Elvira's manager, is in charge of tickets and money but due to a mix up (he is in the caboose and can't get through the train) they are almost thrown off. They meet Larry (Robert Montgomery) a big Hollywood star who is visiting his home town.\n\nElvira's party attend a premiere at which Jackie Coogan gives a little speech. William Collier Snr. is the Master of Ceremonies and William Haines is also in the audience. There is a funny bit where Mr. Haines is upstaged by Elmer but appreciates the joke. Elvira and her mother are invited on set and watch a pretty appalling number \"It Must Be You\" featuring Robert Montgomery and a chorus of dancing soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile Elmer is trying to get through the studio gates. The prolonged chase is the funniest sequence in the film. He accidentally detonates a mine in a scene with Dorothy Sebastian and Karl Dane - he crashes a conversation between Cecil B. DeMille and some others on who the leading lady should be on their next movie. Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo are names suggested, Elmer throws in Elvira Plunkett. The funniest gag is when Lionel Barrymore is directing John Miljan and Gwen Lee in a dramatic bedroom scene - Elmer, thinking the scene is real, comes out of the closet hands raised. \"Where did you come from!!!!\" \"Gopher Prairie\". Everyone seems genuinely surprised. \n\nAfter wrecking the chorus line - Elmer is given a job. The gags end there and the film turns into a conventional romance between Elvira and Larry. Larry and Elmer find they knew each other when kids and Larry then gets Elmer the comedy lead in the song \"The Free and Easy\". It is a very catchy song and Elmer is teamed with a cute dancer (Estelle Moran). It is pretty hard to miss a much prettier dancer in the front row of the chorus - Ann Dvorak. Keaton is a really good dancer - it may be because of his acrobatic training. \n\nAlthough Elmer is now the comedy lead he has lost Elvira to Larry - he doesn't even get the girl in the dance. Poor Buster!!!!\n\nOnly Recommended.",

If you're looking for competition with Buster's great silents of the 20's look away and elsewhere. It's a 9 if you are in the first category, a 5 if you are in the second. I average the two together to get my rating of 7.\n\nThe story is a simple one - Anita Page is a small-town beauty contest winner from the Midwest - Elvira Plunkett. She and her mother (Trixie Friganza) along with Elvira's agent, Elmer Butts (Keaton) are taking the train out west where Elvira will seek a career in movies ... with no contacts ... and no name recognition. What follows are their adventures on the train and in Hollywood once they arrive at their destination. Probably nothing would have happened if not for the fact that Elvira and her mother wind up running into movie star Larry Mitchell (Robert Montgomery) on the train. Larry takes a shine to Elvira and thus gets her invited to his studio - MGM of course - for a look at how films are made.\n\nThis is the fascinating part. You get to see the actual MGM movie factory during the transition to sound. You see a completely inane and awful musical number - maybe intentionally so but I doubt it - that is exhibit A in why audiences rebelled against the early musicals. Poor Robert Montgomery is forced to dress up like a cossack and sing a duet. As Buster is chased through MGM by security guards you get a look at Lionel Barrymore directing a film - he did so for just a few years at MGM - complete with the camera blimps that allowed the cameras to emerge from the static booths and enabled more fluid motion in movies. You also get to see some of MGM's prominent directors of the time in conference, including Cecil B. De Mille who was employed there briefly at the dawn of sound.\n\nNow for the bad part. Buster is forced into a grueling \"who's on first\" kind of verbal comedy scene at the middle of the film that simply didn't suit him, is generally depicted as a bumbler when he had always been the innovative problem solver in his silent films, and during the finale musical number his beautiful face is covered in ridiculous clown makeup. The finale musical number is actually pretty good with a catchy tune and Keaton dancing about like a pro, doing his familiar \"Highland Fling\" if you've seen some of his silents. However, at the very end of the number he emerges as a puppet on a string - emblematic of Keaton's career at MGM. At least the studio let Keaton speak his first film words in front of a train - his favorite film prop.\n\nIf you see this make sure you watch the documentary \"So Funny It Hurt: Buster Keaton & MGM\". It really helps put Keaton's MGM career in context and explains, as narrator James Karen says, \"how Buster Keaton came to MGM as one of the greatest comics in the whole world, and ended up being regarded as totally unemployable just five years later.\"",

This mush of a film is yet another perfect example of when the \"front office boys\", who have no real talent themselves except how to calculate costs and profits in their tiny minds, mess around and essentially sabotage an otherwise brilliant comedian and his work. Louis B. Mayer, as it is well known, had absolutely no sense of humor or appreciation for others who did. He was a \"money man\", constantly worried about profit margins and box office returns. Nuts to the genius he had working for him, as the Marx Brothers realized for themselves about six years later when they came to MGM. \"Free & Easy\" is anything but. It helped to cost Buster his reputation as a creative force and certainly does not appear to have been an easy script for him to endure. He is presented as a buffoon of a man who is merely a doormat for the world. Nothing like his persona in his own artistically controlled shorts and features where he ends up on the plus side of whatever adversity he's faced. Apparently, as with all comedians in this situation, he had a contractual obligation to be filled and he filled it to the best of his ability, even though obviously constrained and repressed from any valuable input. Ironically, the critics at the time actually preferred this type of Buster to his own persona that he had originally created and the box office apparently did too. Who in the world knows why? Chaplin never succumbed to outside pressure and was always on top. So why didn't this work for Keaton? This picture is a travesty of talent wasted on an inane script with poor musical numbers and a juvenile Robert Montgomery.

It really wasn't Keaton's fault for this - Keaton had an acceptable speaking voice, and he actually did welcome the move from silents to sound because he correctly saw that adding sound to movies added to the gag potential of movie comedies. The fault was that MGM at this point pretty much took away all of Keaton's creative control, as well as the fact that the directors and writers Keaton was now working with didn't have his comic genius. What we have is a creaky story, which must have seemed very familiar to audiences even in 1930. The gags on display for the most part are also lame and predictable. Keaton does try hard under these circumstances, and occasionally you see a glimmer of what he showed in his silent movies. But other than a few moments like those, Keaton is very wasted. He almost becomes a secondary character, as a matter of fact, since the filmmakers don't really seem to know at times what to do with him. The thin story also unfolds at a really slow pace, lacking the fast pace and energy of Keaton's silents. And the relentless self-promotion for MGM throughout the movie is downright embarrassing. It's hard to believe that this movie was a moneymaker while some of Keaton's classic silents (like \"The General\") didn't do nearly as well at the box office.

                "text": "FREE AND EASY (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1930), directed by Edward Sedgwick, like many early sound films, happens to be a musical. And like many early sound films, this one, too, stars one of many from the silent screen era making a transition into the new phase known as \"the \"talkies.\" Not counting the all-star musical extravaganza appropriately titled \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\" (MGM, 1929), FREE AND EASY marks the talking debut of Buster Keaton. As with so many silent movie comedians, ranging from Harold Lloyd to Harry Langdon being heard on screen for the first time, wondering whether or not their careers would resume in the same capacity as before, only Charlie Chaplin chose to remain silent a little while longer. For Buster, it wasn't how he spoke that slowly declined his promising career, but how the powers that be over at MGM used or misused his talents as both comedian and leading man. The selection of having Keaton's talking debut set mostly inside a movie studio is a sound idea, yet one wonders how the movie in general might have been had it been scripted and completely supervised by Keaton himself.\n\nThe basic plot involves Elmer J. Butts (Buster Keaton), a garage owner of Golpher City, Kansas, chosen by the Chamber of Commerce, to act as manager for Elvira Plunkett (Anita Page), winner of the \"Miss Gopher City\" contest. On their railroad trip to Hollywood, they are escorted by Elvira's overbearing mother (Trixie Friganza) who has a very low opinion of Elmer. Following a farewell committee at the station, Elvira encounters Larry Mitchell (Robert Montgomery), formerly Hymie Schwartz also of Kansas, now motion picture star on his way to attend the premiere of his latest motion picture, \"The Love Call\" at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Following a series of unexpected mishaps on the MGM lot while movie making is in progress, Elmer somehow is offered a position in the studio while Elvira encounters more than just a possible movie assignment and coping with her mother's constant insults against Elmer.\n\nSong selections by Roy Turk, Fred E. Ahlert and William Kernell include\" \"It Must Be You\" (sung by Robert Montgomery, sequence used in 1974's documentary of MGM Musicals, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT); \"It Must Be You\" (reprise), \"Penitenary Blues,\" \"Ah King, Ah Queen\" (performed by Buster Keaton and Trixie Friganza); \"Free and Easy\" (sung by Buster Keaton),\" \"Free and Easy\" (sung by chorus); and \"It Must Be You.\"\n\nThough some song interludes weaken the promising concept of the story, FREE AND EASY benefits greatly from its assortment of MGM guest stars appearing as themselves, including that of child star Jackie Coogan, wiseacre comedian William Haines, Dorothy Sebastian (who co-starred opposite Keaton in 1929's SPITE MARRIAGE); Karl Dane in Cave Scene; John Miljan and Gwen Lee in Bedroom Scene. William Collier Sr. appears acting as master of ceremonies during the motion picture premiere segment. Notable directors participate considerably into the storyline as well, including Fred Niblo; Lionel Barrymore (actor then turned director before returning to acting again); the legendary Cecil B. DeMille and David Burton. A pity that there wasn't consideration for some now prominent names as Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, John Gilbert in cameo appearances as well.\n\nHaving watched FREE AND EASY numerous times whether it be on VHS, DVD, or one of many broadcasts from Turner Classic Movies, it's my guess that circulating prints appear to be missing some material mostly during the first half hour. There's really no plot development pertaining to the central characters (though whom they are and their background are briefly mentioned). The film simply opens at a train station with its central characters where the story gets going from there. A train sequence where Elvira talks to her mother about her meeting with actor Larry Mitchell ends abruptly, immediately followed by a movie premiere rather than a logical choice of the trio's arrival in Hollywood and what occurs next. Some sources list this at 106 minutes while other clock it to the current length of 93 minutes.\n\nAs much as some may claim the Keaton comedies for MGM cannot compare to those he starred in during the silent era, FREE AND EASY does contain some laughable moments, including one where his Elmer drives to a premiere but is unable to find a place to park his car until miles away near a cow pasture; and another where Elmer tries desperately memorizing his lines for a movie, driving director Fred Niblo and assistant director (Edward Brophy) to a point of mental exhaustion. Had FREE AND EASY been remade in the 1940s, chances are its leading players might have been Red Skelton, Gloria Graham, Frank Sinatra and Marjorie Main in place of Keaton, Page, Montgomery and Friganza. \n\nFinal notes: Television prints for FREE AND EASY were changed to \"Easy Go,\" so not to confuse with MGM's non-remake 1941 comedy FREE AND EASY starring Robert Cummings and Judith Anderson. Though TNT and TCM formerly presented this long forgotten Keaton comedy as \"Easy Go\" in the past, the original title and has been restored. While Keaton played Elmer J. Butts again in WHAT, NO BEER! (MGM, 1933), whether it's the same character or another bearing the same name played by the same actor is anyone's free and easy guess. (***)",

Igenlode Wordsmith's lovely March 2006 review makes a point about an engaging scenario left unrealized by weak screen writing. This is true, but for me the worst example of lost potential is the star. Keaton isn't any good in his speaking scenes here, talking as he does in a kind of daze and overplaying Elmer's idiocy in a way he never did in his silent films but would do too often afterwards.\n\nClearly M-G-M wasn't helping matters. Buster's introduction to sound film involves him being told to shut up by Friganza, then interrupted by a band as he tries to deliver a speech. From one extreme to another; by film's end he's singing a brutal ditty called \"The Free And Easy\" where neither of those adjectives apply.\n\nAnd what an ending!

In spite of what others say, his voice suits him and had he still been independent of the studio system, I believe he would have made the transition from silent films to talkies quite well. Alas, he was not independent of the studio system at this point in his career and thus had no control over the films he was obliged to make. Had he had such control, there was no way Keaton would have ever made a film as dismally unfunny as Free and Easy.\n\nI'll try to give a plot summary: an idiot named Elmer is manager to an aspiring actress named Elvira. He accompanies her and her overbearing mother to Hollywood in the hopes that he can make the girl a star. They meet a matin\u00e9e idol named Larry, who takes a liking to Elvira, which irks Elmer since he's in love with her as well. In between useless cameos and gaudy music numbers, Elvira never even gets a screen test, Elmer runs around the lot like a moron and somehow lands a contract, and then stars opposite Elvira's mother in a stagey \"comic opera\". Larry attempts to seduce Elvira; the plan backfires when she discovers he has no intentions of marrying her and she leaves him, however, they're both still madly in love (?!) and Larry changes his ways. He proposes marriage to Elvira, and she accepts, breaking old Elmer's heart in two. The final shot lingers on his sad, heartbroken face.\n\nI would say this is the worst of the talkies he made with MGM in the early 1930s. While he gave a worse performance in the infamous What! No Beer (1933), at least that film had an actual plot and structure. Free and Easy meanders from unfunny scene to unfunny scene, whether they be filled with lame verbal humor, needless musical numbers, or Elmer bumbling about the set. It's all dreadfully boring.\n\nAnd don't get me started on that insipid ending! The film is nothing but an idiotic farce all the way through, right until we get to the end, then it decides to go Chaplin on us by attempting to drench Elmer in pathos. It's like ending Bringing Up Baby with Cary Grant's character getting mauled by the leopard and having him die in Katharine Hepburn's arms. It makes no sense whatsoever and does not mesh with the rest of the film.\n\nDefinitely a skip unless you're a huge Keaton fan, and even then, you're only likely to watch it once.",

I just think audiences at the time felt they were old fashioned relics, and thus the movies have faded from memory. That said, Free and Easy isn't one of Keaton's better movies. It has its moments, and Keaton himself doesn't do anything wrong, but it's poorly cobbled together and, with the primitive sound recording, it's difficult to understand the dialogue (a recurring problem when watching the talkies of this year). The film offers a cool view of Hollywood at the time. Keaton plays a small-town manager who is accompanying a talent contest winner (Anita Page) and her overprotective mother (Trixie Friganza) to Hollywood. All three of them immediately get lost in the bustle of Hollywood. We see a lot of cool, behind-the-scenes type stuff, and meet stars like Jackie Coogan and director Fred Niblo. The problem is, little of it is funny, and there are a lot of lame musical numbers inserted (although Keaton does have one killer, comic dance near the end). There are some very funny moments, though, like when a director is supposedly giving Keaton simple directions on acting, but they keep getting more and more complex (the look on his face speaks more clearly than his voice ever could).

                "text": "At a time when Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and other great silent comedy stars were struggling to deal with the new technology of sound recording, Laurel & Hardy were doing some of the best work of their career simply by continuing to make the sort of movie they'd been making all along. Hog Wild, a highly enjoyable talkie short released in the spring of 1930, is a case in point. The premise is that the boys must install the Hardys' new radio aerial on the roof before Mrs. Hardy will allow them to go out-- it seems that she wants to \"get Japan\" --and needless to say, the work doesn't go all that smoothly. Just the sight of these guys setting up a ladder on the back of Mr. Laurel's car is enough to get the chuckles started. But where film-making technique is concerned the team could have made substantially the same movie as a silent short a year or two earlier without changing much. Most of the action, after all, consists of sight gags and slapstick up on the roof of the Hardy home, topped with a wild ride in a runaway car through the streets of Culver City, one of L&H's all-time best finales. Dialog is kept to a minimum, and what dialog there is between Stan and Ollie and Ollie's wife is simple and straightforward, without any of the strained wisecracks we hear in some other early talkies featuring other performers.\n\nBut although the material is primarily visual, I'm glad this film was made with sound for a couple of reasons. Ollie and his wife (Fay Holderness) have a spirited verbal tiff at the beginning concerning the whereabouts of Ollie's hat, and this sequence wouldn't be nearly as effective if we were reading the dialog on title cards. Oliver Hardy had a terrific voice, and he uses it to nice effect in this exchange, blasting his wife with heavy sarcasm . . . until he realizes that the hat in question has been sitting on his own head all along, at which point -- after directing one of his patented 'looks' into the camera -- he attempts to brazen it out by claiming he's just found the hat under the bed! Stan Laurel doesn't speak much here, but as ever the contrast between his soft Lancashire accent and Ollie's earthier tone achieves a mysteriously perfect blend. The boys were lucky; Lloyd and Keaton had voices that didn't seem to suit their looks, and limited what they could do in talkies, while Stan and Ollie were blessed with voices that suited their screen characters perfectly and guaranteed they would thrive in the new medium. The other reason I'm glad Hog Wild has a soundtrack is that this movie features some of the liveliest L&H musical themes, those incredibly catchy little tunes so familiar from the Hal Roach comedies of the '30s. The scenes of Stan and Ollie puttering away on the roof (and plummeting to the ground) are just made for this music, which serves as icing on the cake for their fans.\n\nHog Wild is a real treat, and that climactic sequence with the car, the ladder, and the double-decker bus can hold its own with the funniest and best-edited chase sequences devised by any of Laurel & Hardy's contemporaries.",

Stan comes round and is enticed by the chance to hear Japan that he offers to help put the aerial up on the roof.  However with two men on the job the chances of accidents doubles!\n\nAfter a seemingly pointless and confusing start this short settles down to be a very enjoyable film that has good routines that sound basic but are very well executed and are, more importantly, very funny.  The opening title card talks about Hardy losing his memory and Laurel never having had one to lose.  There is then a short scene where hardy can't find his hat and then the whole amnesia thing is forgotten as the film moves to the aerial plot.  It gets much better at this point and is very funny.\n\nAlthough really it is simply a list of ways for one of the characters to fall down - it is done well and some of the bits are clever.  The final sequence of the film is the best and must have been the most difficult to film.  As always it is the delivery of the lead duo who make the material work (and last over decades).  They do sterling work here \u0096 as always my favourite is Hardy.  In this short more than others you can see him when he jumps up in frustration and points his fingers into the air \u0096 it reminds me so much of modern characters (such as George from Seinfeld) and it shows what an influence they have had.\n\nAlthough on paper this doesn't sound that inspired I assure you that, if you enjoy the comedy of Laurel and Hardy, that you'll find much to enjoy here.  But even if you are yet to discover them this is a fine example of their talents before they progressed from shorts into features.",

You can guess the kinds of mishaps that follow.\n\nEventually, they decide to place the ladder on top of Stan's car. Bad idea. While Oliver is climbing the ladder, Stan mistakenly starts the car, and they go whizzing through the city streets. Stan cries, Ollie hangs on for dear life.\n\nWhen they come up alongside a double decker bus, the women on the upper deck are stunned to see a man on a ladder going by. Oliver, ever the gentleman, tips his hat to them.\n\nWell, eventually Oliver is safely on the ground, where his tearful wife informs him that she is crying not because of his horrible experience, but because the finance man has taken the radio away! Oliver squares his shoulders and resolutely marches over to the car where Stan waits.\n\nThe preceding is funny, but what's coming up is sublime. Stan can't get the car to start. He tinkers. He fidgets. He moves levers, including one that causes the car to backfire with a noise like a sonic boom. Oliver sits there expressionless, while his wife continues to cry over the loss of her radio.\n\nStan keeps working on getting the car to go, including blasting the horn several times. Multiple backfires ring out, to no avail.\n\nNo matter how many times I've seen this, I laugh myself silly. Stan is so willing to please but incapable, while Ollie is simply above it all as he sits wordlessly.\n\nEventually a streetcar bashes into them, crushing the car into a bizarre vehicle in which the front and back wheels almost touch. The streetcar conductor who has hit them doesn't ask if they are OK. Rather, in an enormous voice he roars for them to get out of the way! Ollie merely looks at him, and then silently motions for Stan to move along. And wonder of wonders -- the destroyed car starts on the first try. Stan signals that he is turning on to the road, toots the horn, and pulls out. Oliver is stoic. His necktie flaps in the breeze.\n\nI love Laurel and Hardy, and I'm not sure I can explain why. Perhaps it's their undaunted spirit. In this case, they destroyed Oliver's house for nothing, since the radio was taken away. They now have a destroyed car, which ironically runs better now than it did when it was whole.\n\nStan has yet again helped to ruin everything that Oliver owned, but he is content to continue striving, even in a ravaged car that supposedly will take them back to the remnants of the Hardy house.\n\nMeanwhile, Oliver has not a word to say. Broken, but not beaten.\n\nThe world is a better place because they lived.",

For starters, the roof begins to fall apart due to the carelessness of the men, and eventually results in an epic (for the time), collision, sending the boys into a complete tailspin of idiocy.\n\nHog Wild is standard slapstick Laurel and Hardy fare, but it provides for a certain kind of \"one thing leads to another\" setup that keeps it going longer than if it was just an assortment of gags (which it still is at times). The verbal banter between the two men is downplayed, and the only real kind of situational gag imposed is at the very beginning of the film, where Hardy is searching for his hat that he is scolding his wife (Fay Holderness) for misplacing when it is already on his head. Certain gags like this feel like cop-outs and deliberate distractions from the fact that the film has nothing going on under its head (sort of like Laurel and Hardy themselves).\n\nThe short turns a bit more captivating towards the end, when all hell really starts breaking loose. Laurel and Hardy shorts have a traditional potboiler effect to their drama, where events escalate faster than the audience can keep up in the best way possible. Hog Wild has that effect in a low-key sense, making it at least marginally interesting even if the action and the wit isn't as substantial as it could be.

But the boys continued to work. They got the aerial hooked up. Stan tied the wire to the chimney and when both falling off the roof, the chimney fell apart and bricks landed on them. Ollie was very determined to get that thing working if it was the last thing he does, but when going up the ladder again, Stan's foot accidentally hits the starter and the car drives into town with Ollie on the ladder. He's nearly run over by a bus, then sobbing Mrs. Hardy informs him that a man took away the radio. They join Stan in the car, which he parked on the trolley tracks.

First of all is the weaknesses: The story starts with Ollie suffering from amnesia and he can`t find his hat - You`ll never guess where it is ! - but this plot line is forgotten when he realises it`s be on his head all along . The running gag of trying to put up a radio arial is very repetitive when you stop to examine the script , but the repetitive nature perhaps isn`t a criticism because it shows us the slapstick duo at their very best . Ollie spends most of the short getting into serious mishaps and screams \" OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH \" a lot while Stan runs around panicking and making screeching whining noises . It goes without saying that Stan only adds more misery to Ollie`s situation\n\n\nOn paper HOG WILD probably comes across as being silly , repetitive and perhaps a little sadistic but on screen these two lovable clowns had me in fits of laughter . Many of the reviewers rate this as one of the very best L&H shorts . I couldn`t agree more  ",

This is a nice little short from the duo that manages to have several laughs. Most of the laughs come from the physical type with Hardy constantly falling off the roof and landing in a small pond. The best gag of the film happens towards the end when Hardy, stuck on a ladder that's on Laurel's car, takes off for a wild ride through the streets of Culver City. The constant screams from the two are the best moments of the film especially the wild, over the top screech from Laurel. Another funny sequence involves an early fight between Hardy and his wife. Hardy thinks his wife has hidden his hat but he's too dumb to realize that it's just on his head. While this is a good short I don't think it ranks among the duo's best but even a middle ground short from Laurel and Hardy is still better than most.",

                "text": "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is having a little amnesia thinking he's lost his hat, and demanding his wife (Fay Holderness) and giggly Tillie, Maid (Dorothy Granger) to know where it is, and when he does realise he hides it. Ollie says he has an appointment with Stan, but Mrs. Hardy is demanding he put up the aerial to get the radio work (which it hasn't for three months), and when Stan comes along he offers to help. After soaking Ollie putting out a car exhaust burn on his backside, Stan moves his car and they get a board to heighten the ladder to the roof. They get on the roof, and almost fall off, but Stan balancing the aerial pole like a trapeze artist, but he knocks Ollie over with the other end of the pole into the pond below. When he gets back up, Ollie nails in the first pole and trips on the aerial cable going in the pond again. On the roof again Ollie ties a rope to the chimney to stay on, and Stan gets on his back to plug in the cable on the wire, and even after doing it they both slip down into the pond, with the chimney collapsing and bricks going all over them. Stan goes into the house to connect the other end of the aerial cable, while Ollie gets on the roof, and he gets electrocuted when Stan plugs it in, making him fall down the chimney hole into the fireplace. Seeing all the trouble they are having the wife says to leave it, but Ollie is insisting they will finish. After Ollie threatens Stan, he climbs back up the ladder, and Stan accidentally starts the car. They go speeding down the road, Stan stuck in the middle of the car and Ollie up the ladder. After leaning on a passing bus, Ollie eventually falls of the ladder, and Mrs. Hardy comes along crying about losing the radio. They all get in the car, but Stan can't get it started as they are in the middle of the tram track, and they get crushed in between two trams, but they drive away in the crushed car. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Worth watching!",

The real problem is the acting.It seems as if the actors and director must have decided that if the pantomime style was OK for silents it would be OK for sound.As a result the actors in general ,but in particular the one who plays the murderer go completely over the top.Eyes rolling,moaning,writhing.Like he was playing to the back row of the gallery.Sybil Thorndike is a bit more restrained but even she overdoes it at times.so a real curiosity.",

In the case of drifters Robert Armstrong and James Gleason, they seem to be lucky in that aspect with the exception of whom they encounter as far as other drifters. This swell early talkie is filled with lots of moving train action, starting off with a fight on top of the moving train, then moves into a rough but romantic direction when Armstrong and Gleason settle into a town called Linda. There they meet two hard-boiled waitresses (Patricia Caron and Zasu Pitts) who strike their fancy, and vice versa. The film culminates with the same villains from the first reel once again fighting with Armstrong and Gleason, with the car they are on top of all of a sudden becoming loose and heading towards a passenger train. It's up to Caron and Pitts to rescue them, with Zasu ironically getting to the switch hopefully in the nick of time. As speedy as a moving train, this only suffers a little bit for its creakiness, while some of the situations (especially the sped-up fight scenes) are unintentionally funny. It marks an interesting early directing credit for Tay Garnett who has directed many classics but is unfortunately a forgotten name among the great directors of the golden age of cinema.",

On the other hand, I didn't think the reviewer called enough attention to the movie's good points, particularly the great performance delivered by Patricia Caron. She had an extremely difficult role, but nonetheless she managed to make the character wholly convincing, despite the fact that both the director and the film editor were seemingly in love with her as they keep repeating slight variations of her smiling face an inordinate number of times, both in season and out. Despite this over-attentiveness, Miss Caron delivered her role with such expertise that in early scene she actually brought tears to my eyes! Available on a quite watchable Alpha DVD.",

Where as Kurosawa's better known films seem to deal with larger themes, war, societal strife, etc, Ozu seems to be more concerned with the family unit and the sensitive interpersonal relationships that we all go through.  His astute focus on emotion both from his actors and as seen through his use of the camera is a joy to watch and I only hope that more of his films become available on DVD. ",

It runs for only 58 minutes, but it seems more like 158 minutes when you are actually watching its almost non-existent plot slowly, inexorably and repetitiously unfold. As said, the script is a nothing. Admittedly, there's plenty of dialogue and a lot of extremely repetitious running around. Production values are rather slim. The direction is also non-existent. It's credited to Fred C. Newmeyer who did such a good job on Seven Keys to Baldpate (1925). Fred obviously slept through this one and simply allowed the sound man to direct it. All the actors say their boring lines clearly, that's for sure. The star, Alan Hale, even has one boring scene in which he shoots off his mouth but says actually nothing of importance for at least five minutes. And the lovely Sally Eilers is disguised for most of the running time by a ridiculous hat. \n\nGrapevine Video presents the movie in two versions, namely the original all-talking theatrical release and a special non-talkie for those theaters that had not yet converted to sound. Both versions run for 58 minutes, despite the insertion of numerous sub-titles in the no- sound print. Fortunately, both prints have survived. Needless to say, the no-sound print is better to watch, as most of the talkie-talkie- talkie dialogue has been scratched and has not been converted to dialogue cards!",

It's an early musical starring John boles and Laura Laplante.But it turned out to be disappointing.It was advertise as 83 minutes. It was advertised as an musical,But guess what? It was the silent version of the talking classic,Like john Barrymore first talkie,that exist only as an silent. It was a silent print for theater that did not have the talking equipment yet.Everyone is acting normal ,no mime. But with card titles.Not hearing in Laura singing with her voice dubbed,Not hearing Johns Nasal twang voice.Whether the talking version is lost or no that's a question mark. Whether m.c.a. owns the copyrights of the talking version and are too greedy to release it , resulting the silent version having public domain, that's a question mark.The story was pretty good as Laura playing Marie ,who aids the sick and and the wounded ,who are over throwing the court of Versailles. John Boles played the music teacher Rouge De Lisle, whom the real one wrote the french Anthem, is hire by her father ,played by James a Marcus, to become a member of the court.But as the court of Versailles kill her father later on she turns against Marie Antoinette, played by Evelyn Hall,and the rest of the court.The disappointing thing is that being silent the musical number are cut out except for the shorter ones.I hope the talkie version is not lost and it losses it's copy rights ,if that's the problem , and it's sold by smaller business so I can upgrade this silent print. 04/14/12",

The family convinces Fred to give up the girl in exchange for increased position and income in the company. But Fred's lapse is momentary, and he again pursues Lia.

Other than one uncomfortable gag in which Farina almost hangs himself by the neck before Jackie tells him to put the rope around his waist instead, there was nothing truly objectionable here (A later gag when Farina is threatened with a sharp knife by Davidson if he didn't \"eat\" his \"food\" wasn't so bad to me.)

Sadly, Davidson isn't given a whole lot to do in this film other than to act crazy--which was a waste of his considerable talents (he could be VERY funny).\n\nNice Officer Kennedy is a friend to all the kids. He tells them that when he was a kid, he and his friends liked to go look for buried treasure. So, the Gang heads over to a nearby haunted house to dig for treasure in the basement. However, instead of actually being haunted there is a crazed but harmless nut-job living there--who takes considerable pleasure in scaring the kids. Eventually, Kennedy comes to the rescue, but the nut takes extra efforts scare Kennedy.\n\nAll in all, a very contrived and not particularly inspired film. It lacks subtlety and isn't all that funny.

                "text": "\n\"Railroadin'\", the second \"Our Gang\" talkie, was believed to exist only in silent form prior to the late 1970s.  In 1929, sound on disc, rather than sound on film, was the more widely accepted method of making talking pictures.  As a result, many early talkies suffer from the hiss and scratches and pops associated with sound discs.  Also, over time, these sound discs could be broken or lost, resulting in the talkie becoming a silent film forever. For almost fifty years, the sound discs to \"Railroadin'\" were believed to have met this fate.\n\nHappily, this was not to be the case with \"Railroadin'.\"  Blackhawk had prepared a silent version with titles for home movie use, but in the late 1970s, a \"Railroadin'\" sound disc was discovered and synched with the film by Blackhawk, and later released on video.\n\n\"Railroadin's\" sound disc does show the wear and tear of time, and some of the dialogue is difficult to discern.  That does not deter from the enjoyment of the film, however.  \"Railroadin'\" is thoroughly enjoyable and its fun to watch the kids cavort in a railroad roundhouse.\n\n\nWhat is amazing about \"Railroadin'\" is that in some scenes, the train seems to actually run over Farina!  In distance shots a dummy was used, but in the close ups it's really Farina.  These scenes were probably filmed with the train moving over him very slowly, and Farina was probably in a small pit. The scenes, though, are very realistic.\n\n\"Railroadin'\" is as good as the 1929-30 talkie \"Our Gang\" films get. Solid and clean entertainment for the whole family.  8 out of 10.",

In addition to the long-time member of the Gang, Joe Cobb, this film marks the introduction of Chubby Chaney--who plays Joe's brother.\n\nThe kids are all playing around the railroad yard (the dynamite factory and acid vats at the nearby chemical plants must have been closed). Joe and Chubby's father is an engineer and with all the railroad noise I had no idea what was being said much of the time. Joe begins bragging and pretends that he knows everything about trains--and even invites some of the kids aboard the engine. However, an evil hobo comes along and deliberately sets the train in motion--and it's soon out of control. At this point, the film gets a bit stupid--and the train keeps nearly killing poor Farina. Who thought all this was funny?! Plus, the special effects were pretty poor--and almost none of this looked very convincing. You'd have to see all this to know what I am talking about here. However, after all these close calls around the rail yard, the train takes off on a trip through the Los Angeles countryside--and they miraculously survived. It's all very diverting but the effects sure could have been improved--even for 1929 they were weak.\n\nThe morals of this story seem to be that Joe and Chubby have the worst father in history AND you shouldn't trust crazy hobos! Also, I didn't rate this one any higher as it's essentially a remake of the Our Gang silent film \"The Sun Down Limited\"--which starred Joe and Mickey Daniels are the INSANE kids to take a train joy-riding.",

Once again the technical difficulties of the early sound era plays a big part in this short as none of the actors seem that comfortable with sound. It also doesn't help but the sound discs were considered lost for quite sometime and this leaves a lot to be desired in the audio department. The biggest problem is once again the screenplay, which really doesn't have too many funny lines as not much happens. We see the train go back and forth and crash into a few things but none of it is funny. The film also has a rather ugly moment when the train keeps running over Farina who has his foot stuck in the rails. I'm guessing this was meant to be funny back in 1929 but it's comes off quite unpleasant today and that's not even getting into a debate on why this joke was played on the black kid.",

Tim McCoy is appropriately daring, heroic, and tender by turns. I'm not sure if he needed the orchestra backing him up in the one romantic scene, but is was an interesting early example of music in what are usually very \"silent\" early talking westerns.\n\nI wanted to wring Wilbur McGaugh's (the villain) neck, so he did a fine job in his last acting role. Allene Ray, sadly, was almost a non-entity, and Edmund Cobb did fine yeoman's duty as McCoy's pal. It's interesting that Cobb's two-reelers for Universal came to an end in 1930. If this was an attempt to build him up for future starring work, it must not have worked, because Cobb rarely headlined a film again, which is unfortunate because he has a very sincere presence. Don't even ask about the \"pals in buckskin\";I wanted to take aim at the interlocutor every time he mentioned it when he was summarizing the plot at the commencement of each chapter.\n\nSo, this one is worth your time; it is involving, and a good effort from a major studio (Universal) that had lots of experience in westerns. Why they jettisoned them, let Gibson and Maynard go that year, and then picked back up with Tom Mix in 1932 is a mystery. Their production values are superb.\n\nOne last thing: the credit sequence for each chapter super-imposed over a shot of advancing Indians is really quite stunning. Let their war-whoops guide you through each succeeding chapter.",

                "text": "In his lifetime Victor Fleming was recognized as one of Hollywood's top directors, proficient in every genre and a molder of top stars. He was also something of a star himself: handsome, dashing, and a man's man as well as a lady's man. Today he's best known as director (in part) of both The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, shot back-to-back in the course of that miraculous Hollywood year of 1939. Yet somehow, despite his vivid personality and impressive track record, Fleming himself has all but vanished from film history. For a number of reasons he has never been as celebrated as such contemporaries as Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh. At long last, however, that situation is changing. The first full-length biography of Fleming (written by Michael Sragow) was published in 2008, and in March 2010 Film Forum in NYC devoted a two-week festival to the director's work. It was at Film Forum that I was fortunate enough to see Fleming's The Wolf Song, a rare late silent feature starring Gary Cooper and Lupe Velez.\n\nOn its original release in March 1929 this film was primarily silent with a few talkie sequences in which Cooper, Velez, and crooner Russ Colombo speak and sing. Unfortunately, the sound sequences do not survive. The sole surviving negative of The Wolf Song, held by the Library of Congress (and from which the print shown at Film Forum was made) is entirely silent and runs about an hour. It's rough in places, with stretches of visible decomposition and a couple of continuity jumps along the way, but the story is straightforward and easy to follow.\n\nThe time is 1840. Cooper plays a young adventurer named Sam Lash who heads west -- one step ahead of a shotgun wedding -- and becomes a trapper, roughing it in the mountains with two grizzled cohorts. (One of them, a plug-ugly named Gullion, is played by Louis Wolheim, who was so memorable as the tough sergeant in All Quiet on the Western Front.) In Taos Sam encounters a beautiful, well-bred but restless woman named Lola (Lupe Velez), who is tired of living with her over- protective parents. Sam and Lola meet at a dance, and, like Romeo and Juliet, fall in love instantly. Naturally, her parents object, and just as naturally, the young couple choose to elope. They marry and set up housekeeping together, but soon Sam is the restless one, for he hears \"the wolf song\" of the mountains calling. He deserts Lola and heads for the hills, but after some harrowing adventures returns to her full of remorse, having learned the hard way that love is stronger than the lure of the wilderness.\n\nThe story could hardly be simpler, and in bare outline may not sound especially interesting, but The Wolf Song exerts a strong pull. Despite the battered condition of the surviving material it's clear that the cinematography was first-rate, not only in capturing the western vistas, but for preserving the extraordinary beauty of both Lupe Velez and Gary Cooper. They certainly made an attractive couple (off-screen and on), and their first dance together is mesmerizing. They truly heat up the screen. Cooper also appears nude, seen mostly from behind, in a skinny-dipping sequence that wouldn't have made it past the Breen Office a few years later. Velez is so gorgeous it's hard to believe that her husband would even consider leaving her to hang out in the mountains with two ugly old geezers, but it's a credit to Cooper's underrated abilities as an actor that he manages to convey a genuine sense of personal turmoil over this decision. Director Fleming boosts this central, internal conflict with a well-handled visual effect: after Sam leaves Lola and is sleeping alone at his campsite, obviously troubled and missing her, a ghostly Lola joins him, snuggles alongside him and nuzzles her face against his -- and then vanishes. Sam immediately resolves to return to her and seek her forgiveness. And we can see why! Fleming brings an unusual degree of intensity to the love scenes that carries over to the fights: a barroom brawl between Wolheim and his sidekick (Constantine Romanoff) is surprisingly violent, though neither seems much worse for the wear when it's over.\n\nIt's unfortunate that The Wolf Song is incomplete; this becomes especially noticeable towards the end, as Sam journeys back from the mountains. He arrives in Taos without his horse and visibly wounded, but it's not clear how this happened. (From what I gather Sam is attacked by Indians in the woods en route to Taos, but that scene is among the missing.) Additionally, supporting player Russ Colombo is not visible at all in the surviving print, so it may be that he appeared only in the lost sound sequences. Still, what survives is an interesting drama that bolsters the contention of biographer Sragow that Fleming had a crucial influence on Cooper's screen persona and subsequent career. Cooper exudes star presence here. It's all the more baffling that one contemporary review, by the anonymous critic from Motion Picture News, asserts that \"Gary is far from being a lady killer in his make-up in this offering and it is difficult to visualize this picture adding to his lists of conquests among the fair fans.\" I must disagree: Cooper looks great in The Wolf Song, and I'd imagine he set more than a few hearts a-flutter when this film went into release. Perhaps the critic from Motion Picture News stepped out for popcorn during the skinny-dipping sequence? In any case, after this project, the director and his male lead re-teamed for the all-talkie Western The Virginian, a smash hit that firmly set Gary Cooper's course forever after. We can thank Victor Fleming, and it's good to know that he's finally getting recognition for his valuable contribution to the movies, not only in his best known works but also such neglected yet worthy films as The Wolf Song.",

When there are no picture problems, the image is pristine and glowing, but there is a lot of nitrate decomposition, mostly during intertitles. And it's only about 55 minutes- the part-talkie version, since lost, apparently had Coper and perhaps his buddies singing (campfire songs?) A Paramount film + Lib of Congress only = no one ever sees this- get a TCM channel of your own already, Paramount! And don't suck like Fox Movie Channel! The plot summary at the top of IMDb's entry is accurate. Lupe Velez is pale and lovely and there are many shots of her bosom heaving rapidly as she is confronted with the proximate Cooper. There are nice love scenes and a dance scene when they meet. Cooper is bronzed and a little younger than we usually see him and photographed more crisply and lovingly than in THE VIRGINIAN of the same year. He wears an unusual curved-up cowboy hat and his upper torso is seen from behind as he shaves by a stream- but certainly not full-frontally in this print at least, as suggested in IMDb's entry. It's a nice film to get to see for the first time but there isn't that much to it, especially at such a short running time.",

                "text": "No wolves are seen nor heard in \"The Wolf Song\". Supposedly, this phrase refers to the lure of the wilderness. In fact, during Hollywood's transition from silence to sound, many part-talkies were given auditory titles: \"The Bat Whispers\", \"The Ghost Speaks\". This is one more noisy title.\n\n\"Wolf Song\" was originally released in two versions: silent and part-talkie. The talkie version added a character played by handsome crooner Russ Columbo, and two songs: \"Mi Amado\" (sung by Lupe Velez) and \"'Yo Te Amo' Means 'I Love You'\" warbled by Velez, Columbo and Gary Cooper! No prints of the talkie version are known to survive. Columbo wasn't in the silent version.\n\nI viewed the Library of Congress's poorly-restored dupe of a silent print which was severely damaged and incomplete. Enough survives to show that this film was nobody's finest hour.\n\nCooper, only 28, is so gaunt here he looks like Clint Eastwood! He's extremely handsome in this film, though lumbered with a bizarre frizzy hairstyle. Cooper is seen entirely nude as he shaves and washes in a river: from the neck down, he seems to be totally hairless. He gives a mostly excellent performance, although in the later scenes -- wounded by hostile natives -- his character becomes strangely masochistic: a characterisation Cooper wouldn't repeat until \"They Came to Cordura\", 30 years later.\n\nI find Lupe Velez sexy in some of her 1930s films, but not in the 1920s. Here, she's doll-pretty rather than woman-pretty. Her eyebrows are plucked beyond all redemption, her cupid's-bow lips are framed by ludicrous spitcurls. (The Mexican Spitcurl?) She wears elaborate tiered dresses which make her resemble that ridiculous doll some people use as a toilet-roll cover. In one scene, Velez runs in a wedding-cake dress while the undercranked camera speeds up her movements: I laughed as if watching a slapstick comedy. Reportedly, Velez and Cooper were lovers offscreen ... yet they show no sexual chemistry in their scenes here. Cooper is more erotic here in an earlier scene, as he lifts little Leone Lane onto a table. Velez's role should have been played by Dolores Del Rio.\n\nThe best performance here is given by Constantine Romanoff as one of Cooper's two partners. (Louis Wolheim is marginally less excellent as the other.) I dislike it when actors in period movies display modern dentition: as a frontiersman in 1840, Romanoff shows off his grotty teeth to splendid advantage.\n\nSPOILERS NOW. Here's the whole plot. In 1840, rough-hewn trapper Cooper meets Velez, the patrician daughter of a Mexican nobleman. Cooper and Velez are instantly attracted to each other. Defying her father, she runs off with Cooper. The film takes pains to show them deferring their sexual urges until a priest marries them in church and we see Cooper slipping a ring onto Velez's finger. (We see this shot TWICE.) But Cooper can't settle down; the wilderness is calling. Velez warns him: if he leaves her, she won't take him back. He leaves, and she returns to her father. The local Amerindians kill Cooper's horse and abandon him in the desert. He staggers a laughably long distance to Velez's father's hacienda, where Cooper's and Velez's love for each other overcome all obstacles. Fade out. Hoo boy.\n\nThere are a few good moments. I liked one erotic image: Cooper is lying down on his bedroll, alone, then a double-exposure image of Velez quietly joins him. Earlier, there's a deft flashback to establish Cooper's character, but this was done better a couple of years earlier in \"Legion of the Condemned\". Some of the outdoor scenes here are quite beautiful.\n\n\"The Wolf Song\" is simply a poor film, made during Hollywood's very awkward transition from silents to talkies. I would be pleased if a print of the part-talkie version surfaces, but this movie is proof that not every \"lost\" film is a masterpiece. My rating for this one is just 2 out of 10.",

                "text": "Before we were shown this film at the Museum of Modern Art this evening, it was described as Mizoguchi's first sound film. All too soon, however, it became apparent it was not a sound film, but a part-talky, with a synchronized score of largely western music for the silent sequences. At the end, however, the score concluded with a version of Rodgers & Hart's \"Falling in Love With Love\". This song was introduced in the 1938 production of THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE. The version of the movie we saw was a compilation of sequences from the sound and silent versions of original movie, produced a significant length of time later.\n\nTherefore it does not reflect the intentions of the movie makers at the time they originally made it. Drawing conclusions about the excellence of the movie by contemporary and modern standards is impossible because I didn't see the movie. Its value in the documentation of the evolution of Mizoguchi and Japanese cinema is about as great as using six random petrified bones from a dig to draw conclusions on the dinosaur's sexual habits and skin color. I would require the original movie to come to conclusions. Anything else is speculation. Even though a lot of \"serious\" film criticism seems to be talking about what someone wrote about what someone said about some one who actually saw a different movie by the same film maker -- or perhaps the film maker's brother -- I don't do that.\n\nBear with me while I pour myself a drink.\n\nThe plot of the movie is as described in the IMDb. It's a fairly standard sort of plot from various national cinemas and it's interesting that the choice of the male lead is Yoshie Fujiwara, whose father was English, even though the character -- and the actor -- were thoroughly Japanese. Although the nominal highlights of the film are his singing in the sound sequences -- and you can tell the sound sections because you can see the actors' breaths -- most of the acting is by those around him. Shizue Natsukawa plays his semi-abandoned wife and notice the way she is shot.\n\nWhile the camera moves constantly and edgily in sequences she is not present in --there is a silent party sequence which I thought borrowed heavily from the Folies Bergere sequence in WINGS -- when Miss Natsukawa is one of the subjects, the camera stops and we are treated to some fine portrait work. The implication is that motion and change are constant, but that Miss Natsukawa suffers and endures. It's an interesting technique, although it's impossible to tell if this is how the movie was originally released.\n\nThe version I saw offers no satisfactory answers to any of the questions I ask when I see a movie. I cannot even speculate satisfactorily based on other movies Mizoguchi directed about this time; as far as what's available to someone living in New York today, he might as well have sprung out of the earth just in time to direct THE FORTY-SEVEN RONIN. If you're trying to make appraisals of this movie and its place in Mizoguchi's career, you will be frustrated.",

It's even more disconcerting to hear during the opening credits an instrumental version of \"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody,\" but nonetheless the writer experienced these while viewing \"The Old Hometown.\"\n\nThe version in question is a part-talkie, like \"The Jazz Singer\" or \"Lonesome.\" About half the film is shot silent. There are plenty of songs performed by the star, Anglo-Japanese tenor Yoshie Fujiwara, and the recording quality of these is excellent.\n\nThe film itself is hard to categorize, part tearjerker, part romantic comedy. The main interest lies in seeing an early effort by Mizoguchi. As usual, the director encourages the audience to empathize with the female characters. The visuals betray the influence of the German school of cinema, with sequences seemingly modeled after Lang, Lubitsch, and especially in a scene shot with a hand-held camera, Murnau's \"The Last Laugh.\" It seems to this writer, no expert on Mizoguchi, that these influences did not carry over into his mature style. However, the mise en scene did strike me as similar to that of \"Sansho the Bailiff\" and \"The Forty-Seven Ronin,\" the two works of this master with which I am most familiar.\n\nThe film is modestly entertaining and interesting to look at, but its main value is as an historical artifact.

The most strange and surprising things were liable to turn up at any time, despite the fact that most people only had 8 to 12 channels to choose from. Alas, with the advent of syndication and cable, those days have virtually disappeared. Now, we are blessed with 500 channels of bland, cookie cutter pap. Which brings me to the case at hand.\n\nI saw \"Conspiracy\" at 3:05 CDT this morning. It ran on WLS Ch.7 in Chicago. Ch.7 - bless 'em! - is one of the last stations in existence to maintain a film library stocked with treasures that, in some cases, may not have been seen in the last 50 years. \"Conspiracy\" was one of those rare treats that TV used to be all about. It's a true oddity even for it's time ( 1930 ). Starring the redoubtable Ned Sparks, an actor once well enough known that Warner based a cartoon character - ( a suspender wearing rooster ) - upon him, it's about a woman in peril ( Bessie Love ), an intrepid reporter ( Hugh Trevor ) and a bizarre crime novelist named Winthrop Clavering who, for some reason, goes by the nickname of Little Nemo. Oh, and it's based upon a play, which helps explain some of the, at times, stilted dialogue.\n\nAs for details of the story; well, there really isn't much need to go into them. Oh, OK; a girl murders a mobster who is out to get her brother and spends the rest of the film dealing with the characters mentioned above, as well as trying to protect the brother from mob vengeance. Mostly the movie deals with the oddball Nemo, a cantankerous coot who is convinced he can outsmart the cops and solve the mystery. Still with me? The fascination of obscurities such as \"Conspiracy\" is that they give us a glimpse into a world that is so alien to most of us that it is positively breathtaking. These are characters that even a 60 year old codger such as myself find totally unfamiliar. For example, the heroin is clad in a fox stole that would give PETA the screaming heebie jeebies. I mean, this thing is so complete - head, tail and feet - that you almost expect it to start talking. Other period touches include a Black maid with a smart mouth, and assorted exotic villains who speak in indeterminate foreign accents and wear odd jewelry.\n\nNow, if all this sounds as intriguing to you as it was to me, then I urge you to seek out \"Conspiracy\" at all costs. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. Perhaps a better idea would be to give your \"local\" cable company bloody heck for not having more programming such as this readily available.

Wrong, she did it, but there is much more to the story than her looking embarrassingly guilty of cold blooded murder.\n\nMargaret escapes down the fire escape before she can be discovered and goes to a neighborhood house - what passed for social services before there really was such a thing and seeks a job under an alias claiming she's a traveler who has lost her purse and thus all of her money. Unfortunately for her the police know who she is, know what she looks like, and know she was in the room. She'd be caught in no time if not for two people. First, a reporter that figures out who she is and how she figures in the crime but loves the girl at first sight and decides to help her. Second is irritable author \"Little Nemo\" alias Winthrop Clavering (Ned Sparks). The reporter gets Margaret a job as Clavering's stenographer since Clavering is such a hermit when he's working nobody will ever look for her in his home. The complicating factor here - Clavering is a crime author who is proud of his record of solving every crime he puts his mind to, and his new crusade is to solve and write about the murder Margaret just committed before the police figure it out. This leaves Margaret with the distasteful job of transcribing the details of her own crime. I'll let you watch and see how this all unravels.\n\nLike the other reviewer, you just can't help but be struck by two things - both concerning Bessie Love. First there is that fur, which is actually the entire animal, wrapped around her neck. It looks like she just clubbed the poor beast ten minutes ago and hung it there. Secondly is the over emoting Bessie Love is doing during the entire film. If I hadn't already seen Love in earlier talkies over at MGM and had seen her talent in talking film, I'd have my doubts about her, but given past performances I'll have to chalk this one up to probable bad direction. At the film's midpoint it gets so tedious you want someone to tell the girl to switch to decaf if there was such a thing in 1930.\n\nThe real drawing point of the film though, is the irascible Ned Sparks as Little Nemo. This has got to be his weirdest role ever and he just makes the film. He is made up so strangely with that disheveled hair and those dark glasses that if it wasn't for his trademark voice it would be hard to recognize him. He steals the film and I highly recommend that you watch his larceny.",

Hearing folks outside the deceased's hotel room, Ms. Love takes the fire escape to elude arrest. Young newspaper reporter Hugh Trevor (as Jack Howell) is on the scene and falls in Love. He learns the victim was a big-time narcotics pusher who had abducted Love's brother. Her brother is a district attorney. Investigating the crime is cantankerous mystery novelist Ned Sparks (as Winthrop \"Little Nemo\" Clavering). To make it easy, Love goes to work for Mr. Sparks, who lives in a mansion with slavish Gertrude Howard (as Martha)...\n\nThis is a re-make of a Broadway play and \"silent\" movie starring John Emerson. It should have been left there. Top-billed Love, who worked with Mr. Emerson and director Christy Cabanne in the 'teens, had a career resurgence in \"talking\" pictures. Appearing uncomfortable herein, Love most notably wears a fox fur that is complete, from head to tail. Too bad her character is not a ventriloquist. It's probably a good thing Love plays second-fiddle to Sparks, who is the actual leading player in the story. While it's good to see Sparks in a rare starring role, his character is annoying throughout. Those looking for racial stereotypes in old films should find Ms. Howard's \"Martha\" of interest.\n\n*** Conspiracy (8/3/30) Christy Cabanne ~ Ned Sparks, Bessie Love, Hugh Trevor, Gertrude Howard",

It's not even a movie I would recommend to anyone except rabid fans of Bessie Love and Ned Sparks \u0096 and even they would probably not be impressed. Bessie Love plays a murderess. Although she could plead self-defense (and the gangster she kills deserved a bullet anyway), she is a wake-up to New York's corrupt police force and knows only too well that she wouldn't even last a night in their \"custody\". So she flees and somehow manages to find sanctuary with a really weird oddball who fancies himself as a mystery writer and solver of all capital crimes, both real and imaginary. The oddball is played \u0096 in an outlandish disguise that he never removes \u0096 by Ned Sparks who totally forgets \u0096 and when I say \"totally\", I mean \"TOTALLY\" \u0096 that he's making a movie on a sound stage, not treading the boards at the Belasco. In a hammy, disguised voice, he shouts every word of his lines to penetrate the furthest rows of the Gallery. And what was the director doing while Ned was sparking away? Nothing! Poor old Christy Cabanne didn't have a clue how to direct a sound film \u0096 this was his first, although sound effects and a music score were added to his Annapolis (1928) \u0096 and that lack of expertise is painfully obvious. RKO had such little faith in the movie, they couldn't even nail down a release date for me, although it would have to be either August 3 or August 10. Nor was there any record that the movie had even played in New York (where the story is actually set), but I was able to tell them the movie opened in Los Angeles on September 3, 1930. RKO did have a synopsis in their files, but most of the first half of the plot does not appear on the screen at all. Either it was cut before the movie was released or it was never filmed at all. Available on an excellent Warner Archive DVD. \n\nFor completists, an excellent print is now available on a cut-price Alpha DVD. The best thing about it is the superb cover which reproduces the original theatrical one-sheet poster. The poster is great -- one of the most startling I've ever seen -- but the movie is not. In fact, the poster is totally misleading. I'd describe the film as a ham and eggs movie. The ham is supplied by Bessie Love and Ned Sparks, both of them easy winners of 1930's top awards for the year's hammiest performances. Sparks is obviously under the impression that movie acting is the same as stage acting. He shouts every line -- and I mean EVERY line -- at the top of his voice. Worse still, the movie is all talk and very little action. Even the climax disappoints and the lovely Rita La Roy has only a tiny role.",

Bessie Love frantically tries to escape the room where a man's corpse lies.\n\nLove had been around since the teen years and it was her dynamic portrayal of Hank in \"The Broadway Melody\" that gave her career a boost. \"Conspiracy\" was made in the middle of her revival although the next year she made her last American movie for 20 years. Co-starring with her was the zany Ned Sparks, always a terrific asset to any movie he appeared in and also Hugh Trevor. Trevor was a reluctant star who had come to the attention of a relative who worked at Radio. He was considered handsome and could carry a song so he was given the male lead in \"The Cuckoos\". He ended up in a few crime movies before drifting back to the insurance profession.\n\nThis is a terrific little crime movie with Bessie in an all stops out, highly dramatic performance, proving her emoting in \"The Broadway Melody\" was no fluke. It has you reeled in instantly as Love, going by the name of Martha Hunter (one of the many aliases she goes by in this movie) flees to the local Neighbourhood House where she concocts a story of being an \"innocent alone in a big city\" and in desperate need of a job (anything that will take her out of circulation)!!! The manageress takes pity on her but in her younger days she was also a \"sob sister\", so she also feels pity for a young news hound Jack Howell (Trevor) who comes searching for a young girl he helped out of a jam earlier that evening. You guessed it - it's Martha and finally the truth comes out - she is the sister of a missing crusading D.A. and she is trying her best to expose gangster Romano's drug empire. With her it is personal: she has seen too many of the girls she worked with go down that road. Her story proves a sensation and when eccentric amateur criminologist Winthrop Clavering requires a stenographer - Martha is hired. But Clavering seems to have a first hand knowledge of the recent crime... it's Ned Sparks and rarely has he had a role where he is centre stage!! The role gives full vent to his raspy voice and oddball sense of dry humour. I kept on expecting him to whip off his old man's disguise and chuckle \"I fooled you all - it's really me, Ned\"!! Playing the terrible trio of crooks were Ivan Lebedeff, the beautiful Rita La Roy and growly Walter Long.\n\n\"Conspiracy\" first saw light of day as a long running stage play from 1912-1914 written by John Emerson who along with his wife Anita Loos, was responsible for many of the scintillating scripts for the silent movies!!",

                "text": "During the twenties of the last century, the Weimar Republic was beset by continuous social and political conflicts. Demonstrations and riots were common and were staged by all political factions: the right, ultra conservatives, socialists and communists. This was the result of out of control inflation and high unemployment.\n\nDuring those troubled times, an important new film company was created; the \"Prometheus Film-Verleih und Vertriebs GmbH\" (1926-1931) . This was the work of the German communist party and the films were clearly influenced by the revolutionary Soviet films of that epoch. The company was also a reaction against the more conventional, and during the last twenties, more conservative UFA silent productions. \"Prometheus\" was a very active and combative film company that produced a few very remarkable proletarian silent oeuvres wherein those Weimar political and social troublesome times were reflected.\n\n\"Jenseits der Stasse: Eine Trag\u00f6die des Alltags\" ( Harbor Drift: A Tragedy of Everyday Life\") (1929) was one of them and for this German count it is one of the best silent films produced by the \"Prometheus\" film collective. The tragedy of the unemployment in Deutschland and the deplorable situation that this caused in the population, is superbly depicted.\n\nThe film tells the story of an old beggar ( Herr Paul Rehkopf ) and an unemployed young man ( Herr Fritz Genschow ). They meet each other while wandering through suburbia and their lives will change drastically when a woman loses a valuable necklace in the crowded city streets. The beggar picks up the jewel and this is witnessed by a nearby prostitute ( Frau Lissy Arna ). The finding of the necklace is not necessarily good luck for the beggar.\n\nThe film is a sad portrait of those grim, depressing times and accurately reports those deplorable conditions suffered by the German people. However, in comparison with other film productions of that film collective company, \"Jenseits der Strasse\u0085\" has a careful aesthetic.\n\nThe film was directed by Herr Leo Mittler who, since he was actor before becoming a director, was well acquainted with acting technique and draws excellent performances from his three leads that create convincing social portraits of individuals forced to live in dire conditions in the most sordid part of the city.\n\nThe rhythm and the movement of the city street sequences are accelerated, frantic and very modern; artistic shots filmed from various angles capture the rush and atmosphere of the crowded streets and there is the rapid editing that was so characteristic of the very influential revolutionary Soviet silent films.\n\nIn contrast with the rush of the city, the film has also industrial shots of the city harbour ( those scenes were shot in Hamburg exteriors ) where the young man tries in vain to find a job. This gives a documentary feel to the film which of course suits its social themes (real people looking for work are shown in these scenes). At the same time, there are dizzying, shining and fascinating scenes that stand in counterpoint to the darkness the characters experience. The desperation of the beggar, jobless man and the prostitute are symbolic of the situation in Germany. These three characters will do anything to get the necklace even at the cost of compassion and self respect. Likewise the beleaguered citizens of Germany will do anything they have to do in order to survive even if the most desperate means bring only temporary relief.\n\nAnd now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must buy a necklace for one of his Teutonic heiress.",

                "text": "\nIt's always a tragedy when a potentially important motion picture is lost and, therefore, can no longer be seen. An even worse tragedy is when an important film DOES survive, and yet is rarely shown. Such is the case of REDSKIN, a superb drama from the late silent era that currently exists in the film archives of the Library of Congress.\n\nThe title of the film is not meant to be degrading to American Indian.  It refers to the film's hero, Wing Foot (Richard Dix), who is a Navaho educated at the school of white man.  In the course of the story he experiences prejudice from both the whites (because of his race) and the Navahos (who disown him because of his upbringing.  Thus, Wing Foot is looked upon as neither Indian nor white, but simply a \"redskin.\"\n\nI've only seen this film twice: The first more than ten years ago at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the second in 1999 at UCLA.  Other than these extremely rare screenings, REDSKIN seems to have been giving very little exposure to contemporary audiences.  To my knowledge, it has never been shown on television, even in this age of cable and satellite channels.  Nor has it been made available on videocassette, laser disc, or DVD.\n\nWhat a tragedy!  REDSKIN is an excellent film in many ways - from its production values, to its well-written story, to the effective performance by Richard Dix, the film's talented and now woefully neglected star.\n\nWhat impressed me when I saw it the first time - an impression reinforced by the second time - was that here was a film that dealt sympathetically with the American Indians in an era of filmmaking that far too many people THINK was one where Indians were shown as murderous savages.\n\nNot only does REDSKIN avoid this stereotype, but it also sidesteps the more contemporary, \"politically correct\" stereotype offered in LITTLE BIG MAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES.  In those films the Indians are generally depicted as being mainly peaceful and morally right, while the whites (save the main protagonist) are seen as the bloodthirsty savages - greedy bigots with little or no redeeming values.  Instead of showing the red man as evil and the white man good - or vice versa - REDSKIN presents good and bad in both.  The government agent who beats Wing Foot in the beginning of the picture eventually emerges as a decent man - some one who made a mistake and later regretted it.  At the end he redeems himself by aiding Wing Foot in his attempt to register his oil claim.\n\nWant more?  REDSKIN presents not only the conflict between whites and Indians, but also BETWEEN the Indian races (Navajos and Pueblos are shown to dislike each other).  How many other films do this?\n\nIf all this isn't enough, REDSKIN is important for its use of Technicolor photography.  Roughly two-thirds of this film used color.  Although at the time Technicolor had only a two-strip process which could not register the blue spectrum (skies appear white), the red spectrum was fully present, and quite breathtaking in capturing the ruddy hues of the Arizona locations. Color was used for the scenes taking place on the Indians' land, while black and white was used only in the scenes in the white man's world.\n\nREDSKIN has been praised by the late William K. Everson in his book THE HOLLYWOOD WESTERN, while in THE WAR, THE WEST, AND THE WILDERNESS, author Kevin Brownlow states that it is a film \"long overdue for rediscovery.\"   ",

Non-Magnascope portions of \"Old Ironsides\" were projected with a 7-inch lens. An illusion of gradual image enlargement was produced by the movement of black masking on the top, bottom, and sides of the screen to reveal more and more of the enlarged projected image.\" (http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/1999/59/rivoli/theatre.htm) ...however the aspect ratio of Magnascope was still 4:3. \n\nThe first and only road that serves as the access to the top of Acoma Pueblo's 370' Mesa was constructed in 1929 by the Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation for this production.",

This almost forgotten film utilizes Technicolor for 62 minutes of its 82 minute running time (only two back to back reels encompassing 20 minutes utilized sepia and this was to compare the washed out life of the white man with the Technicolor life of the Native American).\n\nThe tones are beautiful and almost all of the Technicolor footage is exterior location work. Light blue, reds, greens are predominant. The new DVD is impeccable in that the Paramount print is near mint- clear sharp images and beautifully reproduced color tones. The original sound discs for reels 1, 3 and 8 survive and are optional for the soundtrack of the DVD presentation, which also utilizes a full length new piano score.\n\nWe noted the title song and main theme bear a marked resemblance to the four note title song RIO RITA but without credit.\n\nThe story is told elsewhere in these reviews, but the script, direction and performances must be very highly praised. The plea for tolerance, education and the improvement of living conditions makes this a real message film, but the low key deliverance of these messages also makes this a great film.\n\nThis was another of Richard Dix's Native American performances - see also THE VANISHING American (1925). He was most at home and is very effective, as are all cast members.\n\nThis is a true gem - we are grateful it has survived and is once again available to the public.",

The fourth disk (where you'll find this one) is about ethnic issues in particular.\n\nParamount Studios pulled out the stops for this film--at least initially. In a rare move, the studio filmed this in Two-Color Technicolor--an expensive film process that may not look fantastic today, but was quite an innovation in the 1920s. Fortunately, the color was restored to its original vividness. All too often, these old films actually lose all their color and become indistinguishable from regular black & white films. However, despite spending a lot of money for this, apparently they ran short of funds and only the initially filmed portions were done in color. Also, white the film is essentially a silent, sound disks with accompanying music and effects do exist for several of the reels--making viewing an unusual but doable process.\n\nThe film stars Richard Dix as a Navajo who was taken as a boy from the reservation and educated at an Indian school established by White America. He is forced to go to this school and his native culture is not so much celebrated as there is an attempt to make him like the rest of the Americans--the standard policy of the day.\n\nLater, when he graduates, he attends a regular college where he's a track star. However, he's called home when his mother is ill and now he's torn because he sees his old girlfriend and doesn't want to leave her. However, he does and once back at school, he's treated more like an oddity or mascot than a man. It's especially evident when he was told that the only reason he's tolerated is because the track team needs him! Sick of this mistreatment, he vows to leave.\n\nAt the same time, when Dix's girlfriend (Corn Blossom) is summoned back home to her reservation from school, her family announce that they are tired of her learning the White men's ways AND they hate that she's in love with a Navajo. Apparently they are from tribes that are traditionally enemies--making their chances of success as a couple very slim.\n\nWhen Dix arrives home, instead of being happy to see him, the tribe (like hers) is distrustful of him because they fear he's become acculturated into the White man's world. When he tries to teach them good things learned from White schools, the tribe disowns him and he leaves to live on his own.\n\nNow, the Pueblo Indians try to force Corn Flower to marry within her tribe. However, she pretends to poison herself and escapes. In the meantime, two oil men show up on Dix's land and try to steal his claim. So, using his great running skills, he runs all the way to the claims office. Once there, an angry Pueblo man AND the two oil men show up but Dix manages to avoid their deadly intent. Now, with the claim registered, he's a rich man and gives the wealth to both the Pueblo and Navajo tribes--ensuring friendship and prosperity for all. And, of course, he can now wed Corn Flower.\n\nWhile some might find the film a bit patronizing today, it was a very sincere and enjoyable effort--much like THE SQUAW MAN. Entertaining, enlightening and very balanced--a very nice film and probably the last great silent film.",

                "text": "Redskin (1929) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nHistorically important film from Paramount was the studios last silent film but it was also their first attempt at Technicolor. The majority of the film is in Technicolor but there are a few sequences, which are in B&W and this was done after the film's backers realized that it was costing too much to shoot in color so they immediately switched over to B&W. It's also worth noting that the film was originally shown in a 70mm process known as Magnascope but that version is now lost and all that survives is the 35mm version.\n\nRichard Dix plays Wing Foot, a Navajo Indian who is forced as a child to attend a white man's school where he is constantly harassed due to this race. It's at this school where he meets the eventual love of his life, Corn Blossom (Julie Carter), a Pueblo Indian. After the harassment gets to be too much, Wing Foot returns home to see that his people have now turned their backs on him, calling him a Redskin because he's not one of theirs anymore. Even worse is that his love for Corn Blossom is causing problems in her tribe because the Navajo and Pueblo tribes hate one another. As you can tell, race is a very big factor in this film, which I think bites off a little bit more than it can chew. There are a lot of difficult questions asked and the film offers up some unique thoughts but the really bad ending comes out of no where and happens much to fast for all these questions to really be answered. The film runs 82-minutes but I think it needed to be at least twenty-minutes longer just to try and tie up some of the loose ends. Even with that said, this is a very solid little picture that manages to be funny at times but for the most part things are handled very seriously. Dix turns in a wonderful performance as the man caught between two races and another battle with another tribe. This is the first time I've seen him in a silent picture and he actually comes off very good. Carter is decent in her role but not up to Dix's league. I've read that Louise Brooks shot three weeks of footage before being fired and going to Germany so it's a shame she wasn't able to finish the film. There's some very nice cinematography and there's even some nice suspense during the ending even though it's pretty stupid and far fetched. The Technicolor process on this film looked incredible and really seemed a lot better than some of the early Technicolor films that would come out in the early 1930s. While this is a historically important film, it isn't as great as I was hoping for but there's still plenty to enjoy here.",

                "text": "Comic drag routines are a matter of taste, and despite the skill of the comedian involved such sequences can easily cross the line into vulgarity, but for my money the silent two-reeler That's My Wife offers the best of Laurel & Hardy's female impersonation scenarios, thanks to the skill of Stan Laurel and the Hal Roach Studio's crack team of gag writers. The premise that constitutes the plot (i.e. Ollie's uncle will leave him a fortune only if he is happily married) is familiar from many a comedy of stage and screen, and is far-fetched to put it mildly, but the creative team was drawing upon basic elements of stage farce: an absurd demand provokes panic and a hastily contrived deception, which in turn causes bigger complications, which eventually snowballs into disaster. When this formula works as well as it does here, the pay-off is rich.\n\nWe know from the opening sequence that Mrs. Hardy (Viven Oakland) is sick and tired of dealing with Stan, her perennial house-guest. She leaves in a huff, just as Ollie receives word that his Uncle Bernal (William Courtwright) is coming for a visit. The eccentric old man has vowed to leave the Hardys enough money for a fine new home\u0097IF they are happily married. Since his uncle has never met Mrs. Hardy, Ollie figures that Stan can play the role for one evening. Stan isn't happy about the scheme, but goes along with it. To dismay of both men, however, Uncle Bernal insists on taking them out to the Pink Pup nightclub, where the masquerade must continue in a public setting.\n\nStan Laurel ventured into drag on several other occasions, but never so amusingly as in That's My Wife. His reactions throughout are priceless. After a somewhat slow opening the gags in the film's second half are non-stop, and the laxity of the censors in those days before the Breen Office was established allows for some surprisingly risqu\u00e9 material. Case in point: the extended running gag in the nightclub, when jewelry has been dropped down the back of Stan's dress and Ollie attempts to retrieve it. Despite the boys' efforts to be discreet, they are interrupted again and again by other patrons in increasingly embarrassing positions, reminiscent of the repeatedly interrupted pants-switching routine in 'Liberty.' This climaxes in a spectacular humiliation when they accidentally wind up on stage before the entire assemblage, instead of the advertised floor show \"Garrick and Lucille in The Pageant of Love.\" The result? Two middle-aged men, one obviously in drag with wig askew, grappling on the floor doing God knows what. Even today, a startling sight. And yet despite it all, Stan and Ollie retain their childlike innocence, even when engaged in a blatantly dishonest scheme to grab money that, according to the uncle's stipulation, they don't deserve.\n\nCasting note: the drunk in the restaurant who flirts with Stan is played by Jimmy Aubrey, a one-time colleague of both Stan and Charlie Chaplin in the Fred Karno troupe of English music hall players. Subsequently Aubrey starred in his own series of short comedies, which often featured Oliver Hardy in support, but by the late 1920s he was no longer a top-billed comedy star. He has a nice featured role in this film, but worked only sporadically at the Roach Studio. (He's a drunken lodge brother who gets paddled in L&H's 1933 feature Sons of the Desert.) He wound up playing sidekicks in Westerns and doing comic bits in movies for decades. Aubrey lived a very long life, dying at the age of 94 in 1983. Unfortunately he was embittered in his later years, and had nothing good to say about any of his onetime colleagues, including Stan and Ollie!",

In the end, the Uncle finds out the truth, and says he will give the money to a dog and cat home, and the picture ends with Ollie getting a bowl of soup on his head from the Drunk. Also starring Charlie Hall as Waiter (possibly the one that keeps having his face going into cakes). Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a silent black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!",

                "text": "Wrong Again was one of the last silent films to feature Laurel & Hardy, made at a time when the Hal Roach Studio was gearing up for 100% sound production, but there's nothing half-hearted or perfunctory about the effort put into this comedy. I feel it stands with the very best shorts the guys ever made: laugh-filled, clever, and unusual. And when we consider the high level of achievement they attained during this same period in such terrific late silents as That's My Wife and Big Business, and in their best early talkies such as Men O' War and Perfect Day, 1929 looks like the team's Golden Year. Wrong Again is perhaps not as well known as some of the others, at least in part because it doesn't readily lend itself to being excerpted; that is, the highlights don't work well when seen as brief clips. The plot is more convoluted than usual, although everything unfolds logically enough, given the misunderstanding at the heart of the story, yet the primary business at hand -- the placement of a horse upon a piano -- makes no sense when viewed out of context. In context however, when Stan and Ollie act in the sincere though erroneous belief that the horse's wealthy owner wants this done, their bizarre activity is oddly touching, surprisingly suspenseful, and genuinely funny.\n\nBlue Boy the horse, by the way, appears calm, dignified, and self-possessed throughout. He earned his paycheck, whatever it was.\n\nIn addition to the unusually detailed plotting, Wrong Again relies more heavily on verbal humor via title cards than was typical for the team, but that's not a drawback in this case, for the dialog itself is witty and adds to the fun. The greater amount of verbiage could have been a result of the writers' anticipation of talkies looming ahead. We might wonder how this film would have differed if it had been made somewhat later with sound, but my feeling is that the silent screen was the ideal medium for this kind of 'naturalistic surrealism,' like Keaton's Sherlock Jr., which couldn't have been improved upon with sound, either. Viewing these silent images we relish the extended close-ups, first of Ollie, then of Stan, as they register shock, wonder, confusion, etc., concerning the task at hand. And it's worth mentioning that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy give first-rate performances here. Some viewers may not think of them as actors at all, but watch how they process each surprising piece of information they pick up along the way: their expressions reveal precisely what they're thinking. Clowns they were, but consummate actors first and foremost.\n\nTwo more things I like about Wrong Again: the supporting players are allotted a few gags of their own, and the biggest laughs are saved until the last couple of minutes. This comedy doesn't peter out, it ends on a high note with a perfect \"topper.\" It's such a pleasure to watch real professionals do what they do best, when they were all working at the top of their game!",

The horse they are taking care of is named Blue Boy so they think they'll get a fat reward when they return him. The problem is that the Blue Boy they heard about is the painting and Stan and Ollie proceed to take a full-grown horse into the millionaire's home. He's upstairs and just tells the boys to \"stick it on the piano\"--at which point they try to get the horse on the piano! It is a sight to see and a terrific stunt--particularly when the piano falls and seems to be resting on Ollie's back--with the horse STILL on the instrument! The film ends with a great scene where there are two exceptional sight gags--particularly the one involving the police man.\n\nI think this silent comedy is a little better than its current rating and is an above average effort from the team.

In this one, Stan and Ollie are stablemates at a horses ranch of which one of them is named Blue Boy. Meanwhile, police have arrested the thieves of the Blue Boy painting and are bringing it back to the rightful home. So when the boys overhear someone discussing the burglary, they decide to \"return\" the horse there as well. I'll stop there and just say how hilarious the short increasingly becomes when the two come in the mansion what with a female statue, a turn of the wrist to indicate how different some people are, where the owner wants Blue Boy to be put on, Stan's hat, and a piano leg. So if you're reading this and is curious about what happens, what are you waiting for? Go see Wrong Again. P.S.

Before such an atmosphere is created, viewers get to see them as ordinary people like you and I. In the beginning, they are seen as workers in a stable whose task is to take good care of an important horse who is called \"Blue Boy\". However, once they get hold of something comic, daring, both of them make a point to launch an all out attack using their comical methods. For \"Wrong Again\", Laurel and Hardy get into trouble as they are unable to decipher the message correctly from a group of people.

                "text": "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. At the fashionable Piping Rock Riding Academy a man (William Gillespie) plans to give his horse Blue Boy as a birthday present to his daughter, and then we see Stan and Ollie causing trouble doing their farm work, including a hose pipe. After this the boys are told by two men that the famous Blue Boy has been stolen, and there is a $5,000 reward, and they assume that the report is about the horse, so they take it to the owner's address, 46 Collingwood Place. We find out that Blue Boy is actually a painting that has been stolen, and the authorities manage to catch the thieves and phone the owner (Dell Henderson) to tell him that they are returning it as soon as possible. Stan and Ollie turn up at the owner's house with Blue Bloy the horse round the side, and the owner tells them he wants \"him\" inside the house, and even though they are confused, they take it inside with he key. Entering the house with the horse, Ollie trips on a step making a statue fall over and break into three pieces, and when he puts it back together, he manages to put its backside the wrong way round. Stan is still confused about the horse being inside the house, but Ollie says millionaires are peculiar and like things to be in reverse, or backwards. Their confusion grows when the owner, busy upstairs, wants Blue Boy on top of the piano, so they scratch their heads wondering how to do that. It does jump on momentarily with Stan holding a plant on top for it to want to munch, and he and Ollie end up running around from the horse wanting the plant. After confusing the owner with a backwards gesture, Stan pulls what he thinks is the horse's tail to put it on the piano, but Ollie has managed to do this, and Stan was in fact pulling a curtain rope. Resting, Stan has his hat being knocked off by the horse, and he assumes it is Ollie, and after it stops and Stan sits on the piano, it collapses and they try to get the leg back underneath. While trying to do this the horse keeps knocking Stan's hat off (really repetitive ten times), but he does put the leg back, underneath Ollie's chin, and then correctly after that. Then the authorities arrive with the owner's mother (Josephine Crowell) and the real Blue Boy, so the owner is very beady-eyed about what Stan and Ollie have brought him, and they walk out with the horse realising they've made a mistake. The owner runs after them with a long barrelled shot gun, knocking one of the policemen's heads into the painting, looking like he has the body, and a policeman walks in with the owner, having powder burns on his backside. Also starring Charlie Hall as Neighbor. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white silent film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!",

The weakest link here is Wellman favorite Richard Arlen, even more awkward than he was in WINGS; playing Heyst as Joe College in a tropical white suit, who just happens to enjoy living alone on an island, he drains the central role of conflict and complexity.\n\nIn this company, the villains have ample room to shine: Warner Oland works hard at threatening the leading lady's virtue (as does most of the cast), but only Gustav von Seyffertitz, in a stylish black cloak and using Bela Lugosi's vowels, suggests the corruption and wit of Conrad's creation.\n\nThe tropical flavor of Surabaya comes down to hula dancers and Hawaiian music, but  Archie Stout provides some effective lighting and keeps his shaky-cam moving.

One of the very popular Vaudeville acts for over twenty years was that of Charles Murray and Lucien Littlefield playing respectively Clancy the Irishman and MacIntosh the Scotsman. They made a film in 1930 called \"Clancy in Wall Street\" which showcased their Vaudeville characters. Filled with Depression humor about Wall Street - and funny lines about Wall Street in general! - this is a very appealing little comedy about types and a time that certainly are no more. When this film began appearing at movie festivals in the late 1990's there were comments about its sound track. Well, nothing's changed there. The sound track still has a hiss in it, and it's loud at a few other times. Never so distracting, however, to interrupt the enjoyment.\n\nGrand old fashioned entertainment. Well worth a look see. Lucien Littlefield made over 250 movies in a career that lasted a lifetime. He only lived 65 years, but was a performer from childhood until the day he died. Many will remember him as Ira Lazar in \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927) or a foil for Laurel and Hardy, but his career with Charles Murray in Vaudeville was memorable, too. Charles Murray made over 275 movies, many of them shorts, so his filmography today is nearly unknown. How unfortunate! Also in this film are Elliott Nugent, Miriam Seegar, Reed Howes, and Aggie Herring.\n\nMy print's from Grapevine, and the quality is what you get, but it's the only print, as far as anyone knows. You get what you get, skips and jumps and hisses, none of which, believe it or not, interferes with the watching much.",

The Irish Michael Clancy buys stock on margin when on a plumbing job with his partner, Scotsman Andy MacIntosh. No problems until the stock starts to fall and the salesman who originally sold it to Clancy keeps coming around for checks to cover margin calls. When Clancy runs out of his own money he uses the firm's money to cover the final call. This infuriates the thrifty Andy, and the two bust up their partnership...and then Clancy gets the call that the stock has gone through the roof and he's rich.\n\nIn the background there's the budding romance between Clancy's daughter and MacIntosh's son. Even that is being messed up by the fighting between the parents and the jealousy of Mac's son over the sudden attention the Wall Street salesman is paying Clancy's daughter.\n\nThere's a final scene between Clancy and stock salesman, Freddie, that reminds you that some things never change. In the midst of the big crash, Clancy goes to Freddie as a patient would go to a doctor and finds out he's just another number to this guy as he's coldly dismissed as small potatoes.\n\nIt's largely humorous though dated stuff, but given what was just around the corner in 1930 I can see why this film fell into obscurity until just recently. I'm sure that in the Great Depression a comedy about playing the stock market on margin probably didn't get many laughs.",

                "text": "So OK this film has little to do with the real story of Billy the Kid, but director King Vidor gets the Lincoln County war (over land and cattle) pretty right. The location shooting for this talkie looks like New Mexico but not like the town of Lincoln. But Vidor captures the lawlessness and viciousness that drove the real-life events.\n\nJohnny Mack Brown (a big star at MGM) was still finding his way in talkies when he was cast here (against Vidor's wishes) as Billy. Brown was 26 years old, the veteran and more than a dozen silent films (working with MGM's top stars like Greta Garbo, Marion Davies, and Joan Crawford), and coming off one big hit talkie (COQUETTE with Mary Picford) and one flop (MONTANA MOON with Crawford). His Alabama accent would soon consign him pretty much to hundreds of westerns in film and on TV til the mid-60s.\n\nBut here, Brown is a lanky, friendly, and brutally honest Billy who only kills when it's the right thing to do. His horror at the brutal murders of the unarmed McSween and Tunston drives his sense of right and honor. He's also sorta sweet on the would-be bride of Tunston (Kay Johnson).\n\nPat Garrett (Wallace Beery) likes Billy but becomes sheriff. He knows his duty but he also knows the Billy the Kid legend is baloney. There's a terrific, long sequence when Garrett and his bunch burn out Billy and his men and pick them off one by one as they run from the burning house. It's a chilling scene but one can't doubt the honesty of it.\n\nSupporting players are an interesting mix here with Karl Dane as a cowboy who grunts a few unintelligible words, Roscoe Ates without his stutter, Russell Simpson, Frank Reicher, Chris-Pin Martin, and Blanche Frederici as the Widow McSween.\n\nBut Brown and Beery take center stage and they are a terrific team. Beery is more subdued here than in many of his later talkies, and his rapport with Brown seems real. Brown is so likable as Billy it almost doesn't matter that as biography this is the bunk. Brown's dancing sequence is a highlight.",

Johnny Mack Brown, even in 1930, was a bit old for the lead, and Wallace Beery considerably too old for Pat Garrett. The romance between Kay Johnson's character and Billy is unknown to history, and the ending is a jaw-dropper as well.\n\nAgainst this, though, the film looks *terrific*, almost as if previously unknown contemporary documentary footage of the Lincoln County War had suddenly been found in some New Mexican attic. The sets are realistic, and realistically grubby, and the supporting cast are absolutely the scruffiest, most realistic-looking set of pre-Peckinpah westerners you'll ever see anywhere. (I think there may be more bald heads than average for the old west, but who knows? Those guys always kept their hats on.)\n\nTurner Classic Movies dusts this one off every few years (it's scheduled for 6/15/2000), and despite every justified quibble about the casting and the script, it is worth watching just to correct the visual impression you may have received from all the slicker and glossier versions of this story made since 1930.

The acting is good and the authentic outdoor locations are expansive & eye-catching.\n\nIn one of his best roles, Johnny Mack Brown portrays Billy as a\nquiet, dependable fellow, deadly with a gun but reluctant to boast or brag, attractive to the ladies and a determined seeker for justice over evil. Everything one could want in a Cowboy Hero. He's also just a little bit dull. This allows Wallace Beery, as Billy's friendly nemesis Pat Garrett, to steal the film, using his doughy face and shapeless body to great effect. Beery was right on the edge of becoming a major movie star and it was roles like this that would push him over the edge.\n\nLovely Kay Johnson is on hand as the wife of unfortunate Russell Simpson, one of the men Billy initially defends, but the demands of her role are few and she gets to do little besides look worried. Silent comic star Karl Dane & champion stutterer Roscoe Ates portray friends of Simpson & Billy, and they are both welcome additions to the film. Dane, however, is given very little screen time, his thick accent obviously a problem for MGM.\n\nSilent screen cowboy William S. Hart acted as creative consultant on the film, but his only contribution seems to have been the loan to Johnny Mack Brown of a pistol which had once belonged to Billy.\n\nBILLY THE KID was originally filmed in the 70 mm widescreen Realife process (no copies are known to remain) with two very different endings - one for American theaters in which Billy eludes capture and one in which he is shot dead, for European audiences.\n\n***********************************\n\nIn the film's written prologue, New Mexico's Governor R. C. Dillon admits to the movie's \u0091liberties' with the truth. Indeed, there are few true facts in the film. Most radically altered is the character of Billy himself, who in reality seems to have been a particularly loathsome human specimen, unsavory & disagreeable in almost every way. But early in production MGM's Irving Thalberg realized the studio would have a hard time promoting a film about a\ndisgusting murderer and he ordered a radical rewrite on Billy's biography, turning him into a pleasant, noble hombre. Good entertainment, bad history.\n\nThere are a lot of ambiguities about Billy. We know he was born in New York City on 23 November, but both 1859 & 1860 have been cited for the year. We don't even know the guy's real name. Was it William H. Bonney, Jr., or Henry McCarty? (For awhile he muddied the waters further by calling himself Kid Antrim.) Billy's family had moved West, and after the death of his father Billy had travelled with his mother's new husband to the territory of New Mexico, ending up at Silver City in 1873.\n\nWe may never know what toxic mixture of heredity & environment stained Billy's soul, but we do know that he became a hellion young. He claimed to have committed his first murder at the age of 12 - he would kill at least 27 men during his lifetime. Billy became involved in an outlaw gang that created havoc on both sides of the Mexican border, with robbery, murder & cattle rustling all part of the routine. At the end of the decade, Billy became a gun for hire in the so-called Lincoln County War, that particularly nasty confrontation between cattlemen, townsfolk &\ncorrupt law officers.\n\nBilly ran a gang that killed a sheriff and a deputy, for which he was arrested by Pat Garrett in December of 1880. Billy was sentenced to hang, but during a daring escape on 28 April 1881, Billy murdered two more deputies before hightailing it out of town. After weeks on his trail, Garrett finally tracked Billy to a\nranch house near Fort Sumner, N.M. and on 14 July Garrett killed him there. The punk was dead, but the legend was born.\n\nPatrick Floyd Garrett (born 5 June 1850) had been a cowboy &\nbuffalo hunter in his youth and moved to Lincoln County in 1879, where he became deputy and then sheriff. After he killed Billy, Garrett became a rancher near Roswell, N.M. from 1882 until 1896. Returning to law enforcement, he became first the deputy and then the sheriff of Dona Ana County from 1896 until 1902. He was the collector of customs in El Paso, Texas from 1902-1906. Garrett then bought a horse ranch near Las Cruces, N.M., but a\nviolent dispute over a lease left him gunned down in the road on 29 February 1908. A fellow named Wayne Brazel claimed Garrett drew on him first, a witness agreed it was self defense, and Brazel was let go. Garrett was 57 years old. It was a nasty way to die for the man who got Billy the Kid.",

They probably should have changed the names along with the facts but there was marketing potential in promoting it as the story of William Bonny.\n\nThe title character is played by a young Johnny Mack Brown, just a couple years after his 1926 MVP performance for the victorious University of Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Mack was called \"The Dothan Antelope\" from his high school football days in Dothan Alabama. Watch for signs of his athletic prowess throughout the film, especially at the end where he mounts a horse and rides sidesaddle into the sunset while wearing handcuffs and leg irons.\n\nKing Vidor's \"Billy the Kid\" was quite a production for its day, probably the first major production filmed in a widescreen format. Although most likely you will have to view it in the 4 x 3 Hollywood format in which it was simultaneously filmed. \n\nBrown's co-star was Wallace Beery (playing Pat Garrett) and their scenes together are excellent, the two manage a nice chemistry with different yet very complementary acting styles.

(\"Say, he can't outgun me.\") But visually, crude as it is, it's not at all painful.\n\nFor one thing, limited use is made of the typical \"Western\" ranches and towns that we see constantly on television and in films like \"High Noon.\" There's a town here alright, but it's just a couple of ramshackle buildings, evidently built for the purpose in Northridge, California, where you can still find dilapidated buildings. Some of the important scenes are shot on locations, including two national parks.\n\nFor another, it sticks fairly closely to historical reality, at least until the ending, when the virtuous Billy the Kid (Johnny Mack Brown) gallops off into the sunset with his girl friend. I have only an elementary grasp of the Johnson County wars, but my understanding is concurrent with the plot. At least I recognized some of the important names -- McSween and Tunston, for instance.\n\nThe acting is all over the place, dominated by the need to shout lines so they'll be picked up by the hidden microphones. Wallace Beery,as Pat Garett, is his usual hammy self; this time he's a sheriff determined to keep the law but he has a soft heart when it's called for. The bad guys are really BAD. Johnny Mack Brown in the principal role looks okay, I guess, although perhaps a bit older than he might be, but he can't utter a believable line. Russell Simpson does pretty well by the Scotsman McSween.\n\nBut the values promoted by the film are problematic. Billy the Kid takes it upon himself to murder those who murdered his friends and employers. The most evil of the evildoers is killed in cold blood. This is a reflection of the chivalric code of the aristocratic plantation owners of the South, the Cavaliers who believed that a man settled his own problems. That's what the sociologist Max Weber called \"traditional authority,\" not the \"rational/legal authority\" that civilization now lives under. Mix that element of Southern values with the greed and ruthlessness of the Northern Robber Barons and you get land wars with vengeful shoot outs.\n\nIt's a curious blend, still in evidence today.",

Brutality and tenderness each try to crowd the other out. Somebody dies, and minutes later everyone's smiling again. I think the Western/Cowboy genre was still developing in Hollywood at the time (even after all those silent Westerns), and the addition of sound just threw another monkey wrench into the works. Nevertheless, you can tick off all the Western conventions and clich\u00e9s as the film unfolds; they're all there. But it's like they're on steroids or something -- you never know when they're going to take on a life of their own. They just don't add up.

After his boss and friend is murdered, Billy swears vengeance on any man who helped kill him. Along with his friends, Billy sets out for revenge only to find himself trapped inside a building in a long stand off. It's funny that this film starts off with a message from the then governor of New Mexico talking about how great Billy the Kid was and how this film was \"mostly\" truthful. This film was famous for being shot 1.20:1 but also in the 70mm Realife widescreen format but sadly all known prints of this are now lost. The film was also shot with two endings and the one I viewed was beyond silly and goes against what the governor said. With that out of the way, I found this film pretty hard to get through so I'm somewhat shocked at how many great reviews this one has out there. Being an early talkie I was surprised at how good the film sounded and that included all the dialogue plus the various sound effects. What shocked me was how old fashioned the film looked because just seeing the \"style\" of this picture made me wonder how much Vidor really directed and if this full screen version was second thought to everyone on the set. The movie is incredibly ugly with mostly medium shots that really don't do anything for the film. The ugly and still fashion of the film really takes it toll on the action in the film because it makes it just as boring. Even worse are some of the performance that suffer because of this. I though Brown and Beery were both decent in their roles but certainly nothing to write home about. Kay Johnson was rather bland as the love interest but future FREAKS cast member Roscoe Ates steals the film as the comedy relief.",

Consisting in large part of a series of often hilarious sight gags, it proves Lloyd's mastery of the new medium. Quickly learning how to make sound work for him, Harold firmly embraced the technology which ruined the careers of many other stars. He also benefited from using the same writers, directors, gag men & character actors who had made his silent films such a success. Appreciating their skills & loyalty, Lloyd's production company kept these individuals on the payroll even when making only one picture every other year, a routine he would begin starting with FEET FIRST.\n\nEver generous, Harold took his cast & crew to Hawaii, thus allowing for the filming of some very funny sequences on board the ship at sea. Interestingly, while the opening scenes of the film are presumably set in Honolulu, absolutely nothing is done to create an Hawaiian ambiance with the sets or characters in any way.\n\nThe movie's climactic moments involve forcing Harold to dangle from the side of a very tall Los Angeles building. This will invite invariable comparisons with his classic human fly sequence in SAFETY LAST (1923). This is somewhat unfair, as the scenes in FEET FIRST are wonderfully funny and vertiginous all on their own. Even with the assist in the long shots from master stuntman Harvey Parry, there was real danger involved for Lloyd (notice that there's only a couple of seconds of rear projection used and that's during Harold's final fall) who once again gets to display his remarkable athletic agility.\n\nPretty Barbara Kent plays the object of Harold's affections. Robert McWade is her grumpy boss, with plump Lillian Leighton playing his suspicious wife. Noah Young, a welcome face from Lloyd's silent days, portrays a hapless sailor. Arthur Housman gets to play (what else?) a humorous inebriate and slow-moving Willie Best is marvelously adept in hindering Harold's progress up the side of the building.\n\nMovie mavens will recognize an unbilled James Finlayson, long the nemesis of Laurel & Hardy, as one of the painters on top of the skyscraper.",

The audience roared and ROARED with laughter and excitement.  It was the funniest, most thrilling thing I had ever seen in movies (I was 21) and I never forgot it.\n\n What surprised me when I finally saw the whole of FEET FIRST recently, after seeing nearly all of Lloyd's silents (including SAFETY LAST) in the intervening period, is not only how well the final building-climbing sequence still holds up, but how inventive and funny the entire film is. There's a long sequence of Harold as a shoe salesman that's as hilarious and creative as anything in his silents, and there are just no dull spots at all.\n\n The final long sequence on the side of a building is in NO WAY just a rehash of the SAFETY LAST sequence.  I doubt if there's a single gag in it that repeats anything in the earlier film.  It's every bit as imaginative and hair-raising as SAFETY LAST, a real tour de force.  The bumbling Willie Best is a bothersome racial caricature, certainly, yet in terms of comedy, his \"unflappable\" casual unconcern is a perfect foil for Lloyd's kinetic, action-filled, dangerous gags, and he has one of the funniest lines in the picture.\n\n Keaton and Laurel & Hardy (in their features) lost creative control of their work in the sound era, Langdon never made a starring-vehicle sound film, and Chaplin didn't make a talking film until 1940.  Lloyd's sound films were not so successful at the box office, and a reasonable assumption would be that they, too, lacked whatever mysterious element had made the silent comedians great.  In the case of Lloyd, at least as regards to his three pre-Code era films designed for sound, this is dead wrong!  FEET FIRST, MOVIE CRAZY, and THE CAT'S PAW are all top-notch comedies (and his three films that came after them aren't bad either).\n\n As with all of Lloyd, this is best seen with an audience, but even on TV it's a funny, funny film.",

Compared to many of Laurel and Hardy's features, for example, the film seems good. While it's not up to the quality of Stan and Ollie's SONS OF THE DESERT, it's about as good as THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or SWISS MISS. And, it is better than or as good as a couple of Lloyd's silent features.

The only drawback is the heavily stereotyped character played by Willie Best, which distracts your attention away from the good comedy material.

                "text": "The coming of sound is erroneously said to have destroyed the careers of the great silent comedians. Not quite true, though some truth to it. Chaplin did not go fully into sound until 1940 with the generally excellent THE GREAT DICTATOR. Keaton actually went into the sound period with a final great silent film (THE CAMERAMAN) but problems with an unsympathetic (even hostile) Louis B. Mayer, divorce problems with his wife, and (unfortunately) alcoholism caused a serious collapse in his career. But he recovered slowly to be a fixture on television and in movies to the end of his career. Laurel & Hardy did better with sound than with silent films (including getting into feature films). W.C.Fields also did better in sound films (and so did the Marx Brothers after their fitful silent production(s)). After years in the wilderness due to scandal, Fatty Arbuckle was making a come-back when he died in 1933. The only real casualties were Larry Semon (who died in 1928, presumably in part due to the collapse of his production company after some film failures), Raymond Griffith (who was unable to speak loudly due to a physical problem - but would play his best remembered part as the dying French soldier in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, and then have a great career in film production), and Harry Langdon (whose career toppled over his egomania, according to Frank Capra). Langdon still managed to occasionally appear in films (HALLELUJAH, I'M A BUM, ZENOBIA) and did work as a gag writer for Hal Roach.\n\nHarold Lloyd found the coming of sound relatively easy. Unlike Keaton he did not have domestic problems or drinking problems that interfered with his career. Like Chaplin he had invested his sizable income into a wide variety of different businesses, and was rich enough to pick and choose his vehicles. \n\nBut he made mistakes in his first two films that managed to show what was no longer possible. Lloyd's comedy was the comedy of suspense and danger. Lloyd's characters, whatever their social class, always had to overcome death defying or dangerous problems to reach their goals. This included winning a football match (in THE FRESHMAN) or capturing a murderer to free his father and brothers (in THE KID BROTHER). His best remembered sequence of danger and humor was the climb up the side of the department store in the aptly titled SAFETY LAST! \n\nSAFETY LAST! appeared in 1922. Eight years later Lloyd repeated the climbing sequence in FEET FIRST, his second talky, and his second error at trying to repeat the successful formula. The first film was a crime melodrama/comedy WELCOME DANGER, which was too long and complicated to be successful. The sections dealing with potential dangers were not well handled - some reversed the whole concept of sound films by having Lloyd and others talking in the dark (sort of making the movie the equivalent of a radio). Lloyd apparently was trying to return to the success of SAFETY LAST!, but failed to notice one aspect of the first talkie. Audiences were not thrilled to hear people in peril screaming for help. As a result the audiences were confused about what their responses to the \"comedy\" was to be.\n\nSAFETY LAST! had a natural build-up to the last half hour of Harold's climb up the side of the department store to win $1,000.00 and get married to his girlfriend. FEET FIRST was also tied to a romance. Harold is working in a shoe store in Honolulu, when he meets a female customer who is the daughter of the store's owner. They are taking a boat back to the U.S. and Harold is accidentally made a stowaway. He has tried to impress the girl that he is a millionaire too. So now he is romancing the girl as a rich man, and also trying to avoid being thrown into the brig as a stowaway.\n\nAt the end of the film the ship is in San Francisco, and Harold gets off the boat by hiding in a mail bag. But he is taken to an office building, and accidentally pulled up the side of the building (in the bag) many stories above the street. Harold cuts his way out of the bag, but he is soon struggling to get to safety. Here, unlike SAFETY LAST!, he is heard yelling for help. This actually makes his danger all the more real. But it keeps the audience from enjoying Harold's predicament. \n\nAn audience today would also resent the humor of Stepin' Fetchit (here called \"Sleep 'N Eat\") as the only person who tries to assist Harold - but moving and acting in stereotypical manner (i.e., when he sees Lloyd has fallen a few floors down, he asks, \"Whatcha doin' down there?\"). To be fair one sequence has both men frightened by a stuffed gorilla, but it is not enough to undue the bad taste of the racism. \n\nSome of the jokes are definitely based on originals from the silent film - when Harold reached the top in SAFETY LAST! he got hit on the head by a machine. Here he reaches the roof, only to breath in some ether that makes him woozy. He also does fall off the roof at the end and actually ends up within feet of the street pavement. It's a neat switch, but it makes the climb upward seem meaningless at the conclusion.\n\nIndividual scenes and sight gags are funny (Lloyd as stowaway hiding behind a lifeboat, and a gull lies on his head). But the total effect is mediocre Lloyd at best. Fortunately Lloyd learned from his error. His next two films were both good (MOVIE CRAZY and THE MILKY WAY) showing he had learned a bit from the misfires of the first two films.",

                "text": "Like the other great silent clowns, Harold Lloyd struggled to adapt to the advent of sound. This early all-talkie effort demonstrates why.\n\nHarold Horne (Lloyd) is a lowly Honolulu shoe-store clerk who aspires to better himself and achieve his share of the American dream, not to mention the attentions of an attractive woman he mistakes for the daughter of Mr. Turner, his boss. But a disastrous experience with the boss's wife forces him to endanger himself at sea and on land in order to get the girl.\n\nIt's the classic Harold Lloyd scenario, except this time he must also contend with verbal humor that too often falls flat.\n\n\"His face bothers me,\" says the boss's wife, who recognizes but doesn't remember the clerk who upset her so when she meets him again on a ship bound for California.\n\n\"You were born bothered!\" her husband replies.\n\n\"Oh, really!\" she snorts, whereupon the scene ends, in \"Feet First's\" signature flat manner.\n\nHarold himself is pretty flat, too. He had a good voice, but he was better when he didn't have to use it so much. His delivery here is halting. Instead of crisp movement, he is stuck with dialogue that hobbles him and slows down his comic rhythm and timing.\n\nA scene where he runs around the ship stealing magazines (he has discovered he is featured in the magazine in an ad that reveals his lowly status, at a time when he is trying to pass himself off as a tycoon) has promise. He carries a stack of magazines to the ship's rail to throw them overboard, only for them to blow back on the ship. Before this can happen, though, we hear the wind gusting across the deck, spoiling the surprise.\n\nSimilarly, \"Feet First's\" most remembered sequence, showing Harold climbing the outside of a tall building much like he did in the silent classic \"Safety Last,\" is made less brilliant by the poor man's grunting and cries for help. No doubt he did a lot of grunting in \"Safety Last\" too, only you couldn't hear him. Here, you are forced to notice the exertion more than you do the gravity-defying grace so impressive in the earlier film.\n\nThere are a couple of better Harold bits in this movie. One, when he tries to pull one of those ads he is featured in off the backside of a female passenger, has her spin around and catch him in mid-reach. Taking advantage of an on-board musical performance, Harold goes into a dance without missing a beat, and executes a backward pratfall for good measure.\n\nBut such scenes are few and far between in a 90-minute movie that feels twice as long. Harold's efforts to avoid discovery as a stowaway come off as mean and embarrassing rather than funny. Harold was always getting into these scrapes in silent films, but there you weren't required to take his antics as real the way you are here.\n\nThere is much criticism of Willie Best's turn as a dopey janitor who tries to help Harold as he's clinging to a building. Best, who went by the moniker \"Sleep 'n' Eat,\" was a black comedian who took roles when he could find them in a socially restrictive time. Harold calls him \"Charcoal,\" which is unfortunate and obscures the fact he gave Best a rare chance to do some comedy in an A-picture. Best's no more dopey than the white sailor \"Elmer\" (Noah Young) whom Harold tangles with on the ship, but it's still a weight on account of his race, not to mention that dopiness is a lazy form of comedy too often employed here.\n\nDirector Clyde Bruckman, like Lloyd, made his name in great silent comedies, notably Buster Keaton's \"The General\" and the classic Laurel and Hardy short \"Putting Pants On Philip.\" Here he seems as lost as Lloyd reworking silent comic tropes for a less-forgiving medium.\n\nOverall, I found \"Feet First\" a labored exercise, brightened only by occasional reminders of Lloyd's silent greatness. It's a fascinating showcase of why silent comedy was special, albeit mostly in the form of a negative example.",

The transition to sound for him wouldn't be easy, as it wouldn't for any silent comedian. I did enjoy this flick, it was pretty easy-going, but as has been pointed out here elsewhere, the greats, the Marx Bros, Laurel and Hardy etc were definitely the yardstick that all talkies/comedy would be measured against for the 'thirties. Harold hadn't progressed further, it's evident here , but there are some good moments in it, although there is a repeat of his 'Safety Last' routine. Willie Best (otherwise known as 'sleep 'n' eat') has been mentioned a lot here, and rightly so, as there's an engaging stereotype of him. Although it is that, at times, of the gangly black man, gormlessly strutting his way through the movie, it's still funny, not because of the stereotype but he lends a 'dumb ass' to the proceedings, or a stooge to Harold. Calling him 'Charcoal' wasn't exactly tactful, but I'm sure the people of the deep south just loved it. A re-issue in 1960 had Harold dub over, in his own voice, the name of 'Charcoal' with 'Charlie'. Not a bad film, but that's all, it lost its way at times, but watchable, nonetheless.",

                "text": "\nBy 1930, silent pictures were definitely a thing of the past. Harold Lloyd, one of the ultimate masters of silent comedy, was forced to adapt his style to sound. This was not as easy as one would think - \"Welcome Danger\", his first all-talking picture, displayed very little of his usual sight-gag style, instead relying on verbal quips and one-liners and, consequently, being vastly inferior to his silent masterpieces. Fortunately, Lloyd realized this and \"Feet First\", his second sound film, is again on par with his greatest silents - for the most part. Although totally lacking of something like a story, \"Feet First\" keeps the one-liner rate at an absolute minimum, instead abounding with sight-gags.\n\nSo how come that this movie is never counted among Lloyd's masterpieces? Some people consider it a total rip-off of his silents; it generally is not, it just follows the same pattern. The only letdown is the last reel; the house-climbing episode desperately tries to copy and improve Lloyd's earlier dare-devil climbing scenes but it fails to deliver, partly because of the poor editing and pacing (compared to \"Safety Last\"), partly because of the stereotype racist portrayal of the janitor, played by Willie \"Sleep'n'Eat\" Best.\n\nApart from that last reel, however, \"Feet First\" ranks among Lloyd's funniest, if not his best pictures (it simply lacks a bit of the beauty of \"The Kid Brother\" or the pace of \"Safety Last\" to rival with those two) and certainly among his prime talkies.",

First of all those gags are more suitable for silent pictures, secondly  the thrill wears out if you saw it before.  In this film this problem is most noticeable because it is conceptually a sound remake of Safety Last.  To be fair, it has its moments-especially when Harold tried to get his breakfast; the newspaper gag worked well, too.  But the Harold Horne character is simply not as likeable or as sympathetic as The Boy in Safety Last.  Those contrived, saying-ridden dialogue doesn't help, either.  The biggest let-down is really what was supposed to be the highlight-the building climbing scene, which is just a reverse of the same scene minus the clock in Safety Last.  Technically the climbing is as challenging as in Safety Last, but for viewers it is definitely a lot less thrilling, because we already saw it before, done by the same person.  I strongly recommend anyone who gets to see this movie to just press mute to better `enjoy' this sequence,  since the so-called sound effect is just Lloyd panting, shouting some ugly racial slurs and serves no other purpose than annoying.",

            "King Louis XIII of France is thrilled to have born to him a son - an heir to the throne. But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll."

                "text": "THE IRON MASK (United Artists, 1929), directed by Allan Dwan, based on \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" by Alexander Dumas, a sequel to Dumas's THE THREE MUSKETEERS (United Artists, 1921), both starring Douglas Fairbanks as D'Artagnan and Marguerite De La Motte as Constance, is a worthy farewell to Fairbanks making his final silent screen adventure.\n\nThose familiar with the plot, which was remade several times on screen and television, including THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK (United Artists, 1939) with Louis Hayward, and/ or the most recent and satisfactory 1998 featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeremy Irons, will find the story here not much different, but only shorter in its basic format, as is with its title. The story begins with King Louis XIII of France (Rolfe Sedan) receiving the news of the birth of his son, the future heir to the throne. The only problem is that the heir also has a twin. Since there cannot be two heirs, this news must be kept in utmost secrecy and anyone involved must be put away forever. Constance Beaucieux (Marguerite De La Motte), D'Artagnan's (Douglas Fairbanks), beloved, who was the midwife during the birth, is immediately put away in the Convent of Martes by orders of Count De Rochefort (Ullrich Haupt). Unaware of the secret, D'Artagnan tries to rescue Constance from being held prisoner against her will, but arrives too late. She has been stabbed by Milady De Winter (Dorothy Revier) after discovering the secret mark on her shoulder, the brand of a common criminal. Before Constance dies in D'Artagnan's arms, she utters her final words to him, \"the other one ...\" The death of Constance leaves D'Artagnan feeling empty and bitter. D'Artagnan, who has been reunited with his colleagues, The Three Musketeers, later saves them from being executed by orders of the Cardinal Richelieu (Nigel De Brulier). After D'Artagnan rescues Richelieu from De Rochefort's men, the Musketeers are pardoned, but find they must part company once more when D'Artagnan is appointed as guardian to the newborn infant and sent to Spain while the actual heir to the throne remains in France. Some twenty years later, the evil twin brother (William Bakewell), a spoiled young man, eventually learns his true identity and of his twin brother holding the throne in France from the villainous De Rochefort. The evil twin plots to take over the throne by having his brother abducted, and banishing him by having him locked in a dungeon with his face sealed in an iron mask for all eternity, and being given food from the guards from under the door, and with strict orders for him not to ever have any visitors. While taking control of the throne, the evil twin meets with his mother, Queen Anne (Belle Bennett), who immediately realizes what's happening. It is then up to the D'Artagnan and his musketeers, now older men, to reunite and save the day.\n\nFeatured in the supporting cast are Stanley Sanford as Porthos; Leon Bary as Athos; Gino Corrado as Aramis; Vera Lewis as Madame Peronne and Gordon Thorpe playing the boy prince and his evil twin.\n\nA satisfactory version that becomes a bit slow going at times due to a couple of flashbacks, but then picks up speed again with a memorable swashbuckling conclusion. THE IRON MASK was first introduced as part of the 12-week series on public television's THE SILENT YEARS (1975), hosted by Lillian Gish. Because this was Fairbanks' final silent adventure, released the final year of the silent era (1929), THE IRON MASK became the film chosen as the closing chapter to this series. Accompanied with an original piano score by William J. Perry, from the Paul Killiam collection, and running at the length of about 87 minutes, THE IRON MASK also consisted of color tinted scenes. Reportedly distributed theatrically with talking sequences, sound effects and an original musical score (which may still exist today), THE IRON MASK was later reissued in 1952 through Odyssey Pictures, eliminating the original title cards, replaced with narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and accompanied by a new orchestral score. Available with the excellent Perry piano score on video cassette through Blackhawk Films in the 1980s, current video copies distributed in the 1990s present THE IRON MASK with its 1952 72 minute reissue format, the version which formerly aired on American Movie Classics from 1997-1998. Although the difference being the length and clearer picture quality, with the narration giving a better outlook and understanding to the storyline, silent film buffs would prefer to see THE IRON MASK restored to its original silent format. Thanks to KINO video, it's own copy has been restored with sound prologue with Doug Fairbanks himself as well as an orchestral score by Carl Davis. HO-LA! (***)",

                "text": "\nWith his head encased in THE IRON MASK that hides his identity, the true king of France waits for the elderly D'Artagnan & the Three Musketeers to come to his rescue...\n\nDouglas Fairbanks, silent cinema's greatest swashbuckling hero, bid farewell to the glory days of the silent screen with this joyous romp of a film. As a sequel to Fairbanks' earlier THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1921), it more than surpasses its predecessor in lavish production values, good acting & nonstop action.\n\nNow 46, Fairbanks seems none the worse for wear and his muscular athleticism is still called upon to win the girl, beat the foe & thrill the audience. Fairbanks had a natural spontaneity &\nauthentic joie de vivre, both in his private life and in his screen persona, which audiences of the 1920's found absolutely irresistible. He was unique - unforgettable - utterly irreplaceable.\n\nFairbanks is supported once again by a fine cast: lovely Marguerite De La Motte as the faithful Constance; Dorothy Revier as the treacherous Milady de Winter; William Bakewell in the dual role of the two princes; Lon Poff as the sinister Father Joseph. That's the excellent character actress Vera Lewis in the tiny role of the Royal Midwife.\n\nThe Three Musketeers themselves are rather more finely delineated than in the previous film. L\u00e9on Bary as Athos, Tiny Sandford as Porthos & Gino Corrado as Aramis all give good account of themselves throughout the flurry & turmoil of the lively plot.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of British actor Nigel de Brulier, once again playing the rapacious Cardinal Richelieu. Even though the character disappears half way into the film, de Brulier still manages to invest the Churchman with more than just villainy. He helps the viewer to glimpse the real person behind the facade and to understand some of the reasons for his tyrannical behavior.\n\nOne of the versions in which this film is available has all the title cards removed & a rousing narrative read by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. substituted in their place.\n\n**************************\n\nThe opening credits state that the film's narrative was based on the story by Elton Thomas (a pseudonym for Fairbanks), which was in turn based on Alexander Dumas' \u0091The Three Musketeers' & \u0091Twenty Years After.' This is true, but all of the Man in the Iron Mask elements actually came from Dumas' novel \u0091Ten Years Later; or, The Vicomte de Bragelonne,' (1848-50). Thus, the events in the latter half of THE IRON MASK take place 30 years after the events in THE THREE MUSKETEERS.\n\nThe first film is set in 1625; the second film starts in 1638. Since important plot elements are not handled in THE THREE MUSKETEERS - for instance, Milady's evil behavior towards Constance - they are somewhat incongruously left dangling for 13 years until the beginning of THE IRON MASK. And some of the most fascinating elements of the later books - such as the Musketeers' clash with Milady's malevolent son & the machinations of Richelieu's successor, the wily Cardinal Mazarin - are completely ignored altogether.\n\nBut this is a mere quibble and should not detract from the immense enjoyment of a very fine film. It might be helpful to note, in passing, a few historical dates which deal directly with the plot: \n\nLouis XIV born September 15, 1638.\n\nCardinal Richelieu dies December 4, 1642.\n\nLouis XIII dies May 14, 1643.\n\nLouis XIV is crowned King in 1654, after attaining maturity.",

                "text": "\nIn Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's extraordinary 1980 documentary about the silent era \"Hollywood\" the final sequence of \"The Iron Mask\" is described as Fairbanks' farewell to the silent film.  And it is.\n\nGenerally this is an inferior film to the amazing 1921 \"Three Musketeers\". Allan Dwan is not the visual stylist that Fred Niblo is, and so \"The Iron Mask\" becomes much more of a straightforward action film.  But as such it is splendid.  I think we tend to forget what a good actor Fairbanks was.  His emotional journey here is quite powerful as he faces the death of his lady and of his friends - and he ages convincingly as well.\n\nMost of the cast is different to the \"Three Musketeers\" but Margueritte de la Motte returns as Constance and the unforgettable Nigel de Brulier again plays Richilieu with extreme venom.\n\nFairbanks has an athletic field day as well.  There seem to be a number of versions of this film around.  The one I saw ran 95 minutes and had tinted sequences.  I've seen some advertised as having talking sequences, and others with narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr - the one i saw had neither of these.\n\nIt was probably the last large scale silent feature made in Hollywood. And that is what gives those gorgeous last minutes such power.  The silent era was truly the golden years of Hollywood and Fairbanks was its king - in this film he sadly abdicates.",

After some years, Mr. Fairbanks' main job becomes protecting the French King's good son. Unbeknownst to most everyone (except the movie audience), the Prince and heir to the throne, William Bakewell (as Prince Louis XIV), has an evil twin brother; the identical twosome were separated-at-birth, in order to assure one King ascended to the throne, without incident. However, \"good\" Prince Bakewell is abducted, and locked up in \"The Iron Mask\"; then, \"bad\" Prince Bakewell takes his place. Fairbanks and his musketeer pals must set things right.\n\nWith its superb acting, brilliant pace, and stunning photography, this is the one Douglas Fairbanks film you must see, if you only see one. \"The Iron Mask\" is among the best films in the swashbuckler and silent film genres. It's also (probably) Fairbanks' best performance as an actor. His quintessential performance, and film, might have been overlooked for \"Academy Award\" consideration due to Fairbanks being, at the time, President of the Academy. It was also apparent, to Fairbanks and others, that the popularity of talking pictures would soon silence the older style, despite the artful late 1920s silent film productions.\n\n\"The Iron Mask\" featured a spoken word introduction (with Fairbanks in fine voice); currently, it is the rarer version. As the Fairbanks' introductory words invite viewers into the \"shadows of the past\", of a different \"age\", it's worth seeking out the original introduction. Another version featured Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s narration, replacing intertitles; this version is interesting, to a point. Note, eventually, the \"narration\" version becomes distracting and obvious.\n\nFairbanks, with director Allan Dwan and photographer Henry Sharp, came up with an ending so memorable it's been said to symbolize the approaching end of its star's career, and the end of silent films in general. They could hardly have had a more suitable ending. For Douglas Fairbanks and company, \"The Iron Mask\" was a perfect fit. \n\n********** The Iron Mask (2/21/29) Allan Dwan ~ Douglas Fairbanks, William Bakewell, Nigel de Brulier, L\u00e9on Bary",

                "text": "Monday August 28, 7:00pm, The Paramount Theater\n\nDumas amuck \u0085\n\nAmong the most popular works of literature adapted for film, Alexander Dumas' D'Artagnan Romances, have seen no less than ninety versions produced for the screen, from Biograph's abbreviated, Fencing Contest from 'The Three Musketeers' (1898), to French and Latvian features released in 2005. Dumas' trilogy, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne, have been reincarnated as animated characters, French Legionnaires, secret agents, troubadours and even Texas Rangers!\n\nA Modern Musketeer ...\n\nD'Artagnan was perfect casting for an excessively energetic Douglas Fairbanks in A Modern Musketeer (1917). The film offered a glimpse of the young swordsman as a fantasy sequence within a modern story. It also served as a seed of inspiration when Fairbanks launched into the final decade of his silent film career with a series of costume dramas including The Three Musketeers (1921). The art direction, production design and originality of these films, which include Robin Hood (1923), The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and The Gaucho (1928) remains unsurpassed today. As his finale to the silent era, Fairbanks returned to Dumas and D'Artagnan's further adventures in The Iron Mask (1929). Along with Fairbanks, returning from the 1921 film were Marguerite De La Motte as Constance, Nigel De Brulier as Cardinal Richelieu (a character he played four times), Lon Poff as Father Joseph, Charles Stevens as Planchet, D'Artagnan's servant, Leon Bary as Athos and screenwriter Lotta Woods. Fairbanks also gave a nod to the coming of sound by including a Vitaphone sound-on-disk synchronized musical score which included a spoken prologue and bridge between the end of the Musketeers and Twenty Years After. In 1929, the film was released with both sound and silent versions, as was often the case.\n\n\"It is sometimes more difficult for Kings to return \u0085 Than to make an exit.\"\n\nThis was the last and final time Fairbanks would buckle his swash and the culmination of a lifetime playing humorous and high-spirited action heroes. For it's sheer brilliance of concept, its fluid movement from one scene to the next with the continuous flow of narrative, the initial introduction of characters and setup of the story in this film is unequaled. The film begins with the entrance of King Louis XIII at St. Germain as he anxiously awaits the birth of an heir. The quality of set design, thousands of costumed extras used, monumental production scale and painstaking detail of craftsmanship could never be undertaken today. From the palace, the action moves to D'Artagnan beckoning Constance from the street, below her window. She must hurry to the waiting Queen's coach, and in a sequence of almost balletic beauty she and D'Artagnan hurry from place to place, in search of a moment's privacy, and a kiss. At forty-five, Fairbanks shows every bit of the athletic grace seen in earlier films as he and De La Motte glide over a garden wall and back again. Fairbanks gives his character just the right amount of boyish mischief to balance a flawless performance. D'Artagnon literally rides into the next scene as he jumps from the coach to the aid of his fellow musketeers. They challenge the Cardinal's Guards, then seamlessly move into a wonderful display of humorous camaraderie as the four link arms in a tug-of-war between the much larger Porthos (Stanley J. Stanford) and D'Artagnan that ends as they pull a cartload of barrels into a tavern. Only Fairbanks could transform something as simple as catching a tossed breadroll into a captivating display of skill. The Musketeers are left to pass the time as the action returns to the palace and Louis presenting his newborn son to the cheering sea of humanity below (and that ain't cgi!). And then of course, there is \" \u0085the other one \u0085\" As in all Fairbanks' films, the swordplay is spectacular, this time using Belgian fencing master Fred Cavens as coach and consultant. Overall production was supervised by Maurice Leloir, \"\u0085 the acknowledged authority on the period depicted. With The Iron Mask , Fairbanks offers a combination of action, romance and humor showcasing the skills that he developed over years as he literally defined the genre. It's hard to imagine having a better time at any movie.",

                "text": "One of the best versions of The Man in the Iron Mask and one of Douglas Fairbanks' best films too. Details-wise, The Iron Mask might deviate from the book but the spirit of the story still remains, and in a much better way than most of the versions that followed it. It does feel rushed at times, and William Bakewell does do much better as the good twin than the evil twin, as the good twin he is sincere but as the evil twin he does over-egg the pudding too much. The sets and costumes are beautiful with the attention to detail authentic, while the photography is equally effective like the shadowy effects in the prison scenes that are most atmospheric. Carl Davis' score fits the action very well and sounds sweeping in an appropriate way. The film is written in a snappy way, the story is as fun, energetic, exciting and tense as the story of The Man in the Iron Mask is, the ending is genuinely moving(and not just mildly, this is emotional stuff) and the action is rousing and leaves you at the edge of your seat biting your nails and cheering for the heroes. Douglas Fairbanks is an as ever lively presence, with stunts and athletic moves that are the envy of anybody regardless of their age, but brings also pathos to his performance as well. In support, everybody is very good but Nigel De Brulier is broadly venomous, Margarite De LaMotte will leave you really identifying with Constance and rooting for her and Ulrich Haupt is a sinister Rochefort but with somewhat a charm of his own. All in all, well worth looking out for, Fairbanks' touted farewell to silent swash-bucklers is an excellent film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

He did, despite rumors, have a very nice voice and was perfect for the role of narrator. I would have much preferred to see the movie in its original form, as viewing it this way was a bit odd. It was like watching a silent and having someone talk throughout\u0097acting out some of the parts and describing the action. Many of the descriptions (such as \"the dice are kind\" as D'Artagnon wins at playing dice) are completely unnecessary and detract from the film.\n\nThis sort of reissuing of a silent with narration and sound is not unheard of, as Chaplin did this with THE GOLD RUSH. About 20 years after its initial silent release, Chaplin re-released it with his narration and a musical score he wrote himself. Many complained about this as a bastardization of the original, but I actually like both versions about equally\u0097they are indeed classics. I assume Chaplin got this idea, in part, from the re-release of IRON MASK.\n\nThe film begins with some irrelevant scenes where the four Musketeers get into trouble and have fun. When the actual important part of the story begins, Louis XIII is excited because his wife just had a son! He is thrilled to have an heir. But, unexpectedly, shortly after the baby's birth, the Queen gives birth to another boy\u0097an identical twin! Cardinal Richelieu and his sidekick begin their scheming\u0097and their rival, Rochefort, finds out their plans. Richelieu's plan is to have the other child raised as a commoner along the Spanish frontier\u0097why, exactly, he's doing this is unknown. It's interesting that in this version, Rochefort is a scoundrel much like Richelieu is in later ones\u0097as in later versions (such as the Louis Hayward and Richard Chamberlain films) Rochefort was a good guy and worked with the Musketeers for France's best interests and Richelieu was a scheming jerk. Here, the roles are reversed and the entire story is changed. Instead of removing a bad king (Louis XIV) and substituting a good twin brother, the plan of Rochefort is to get rid of the good one and install the more malleable and evil one in his place.\n\nYears have passed and Rochefort has gotten a hold of the twin\u0097turning him evil and selfish. On the other hand, the Prince has grown into a decent guy and able ruler\u0097due, in part, to the able tutelage by D'Artagnon. Rochefort plans to have the evil twin substituted in place of good King Louis XIV. Who will win this battle of wits? Watch it for yourself and see.\n\nLike most of Fairbanks' other silents, this one in which he starred was a high-budget film\u0097with great sets and costumes. Considering he was the biggest swashbuckling star of the era, this isn't surprising and it looks great. While the story is a bit jumbled as well as hurried in the process, it's a pretty good movie\u0097though I strongly recommend you try to find the original version if you can\u0097Fairbanks just talks too much in this one and you lose some of the beauty of this well-acted film.",

But at age 46 he could still bound and leap and climb and buckle a swash better than the best men half his age, better, in fact, than almost any man of any age. And what an actor! Just his smile could make his audience joyful. His tenderness, his sincerity, and his depth were irresistible convincing, capturing every emotion he wished to convey. Although this was his last silent film, it contained a brief sound introduction to Part 1 and another to Part 2, both with shots of Fairbanks narrating in a stirring, proud voice. A few elements of the film are dated, most notably the shots of the evil royal twin, who emoted in the hammiest sense. Little items like that do not detract from the appeal of The Iron Mask. This was the first time I'd watched it. I will watch it again.",

                "text": "Let me begin by stating that I am reviewing the 1952 re-release version with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr's narration (written, I might add, by Richard Llewellyn of \"How Green Was My Valley\" fame). Fairbanks the younger's delivery of Llewellyn's words is shear poetry! I know this version has been cut and usually I prefer films as they were originally intended, but in this case I'll make an exception since DFJ's narration really makes the film for me. (Still, it would be nice to see how the original \"talkie\" bits sounded in the elder Fairbank's voice. I might have to catch the restored original too.) Aside from the joy of listening to DFJ's beautiful voice bring his father's work to life for me, I must say I really enjoyed the picture itself. I've seen both the 1939 version with Louis Hayward and the 1977 version with Richard Chamberlain, and while both of those are very good, this one might be the best of the three. Thanks to Fairbanks, Sr. of course it probably has the best action sequences, but the over all acting is also quite wonderful. I must say I was especially impressed with William Blakewell in the duel role of the twins, Nigel De Brulier as Richelieu, and Ullrich Haupt as the villain De Rochefort. This was Fairbanks' final silent film, and his acting here is at its best. He makes a perfect D'Artagnan! The sets and costumes are also magnificent here! Fairbanks pretty much wrote the script too--even though he disguised that fact somewhat by using his middle names in the credits. The credits read story by Elton Thomas; Fairbanks' full birth name was Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman. Maybe he figured that having his name in the credits as both star and producer was enough. And although the storyline varies in many important ways in the Haywood version 10 years later, in other ways it follows Fairbanks' ending quite closely. (It's been years since I saw the 1977 version, but I think its plot is not as close. I do remember it had some marvelous acting in it, but considering it starred Richard Chamberlain, Sir Ralph Richardson, Louis Jourdan, and Patrick McGoohan, how could it not?) Anyway back to the 1929 version--I've seen more than my share of Three Musketeers films and this is one of the best!",

It was certainly a worthy farewell.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks probably could have continued his career in talkies and he did make a few films in that medium. But silent films were perfect for his boisterous personality. Neither he or Mary Pickford every really learned to dial it down a bit for sound. I like to think of this rather than The Private Life Of Don Juan as his real farewell picture.\n\nActually a bit of The Three Musketeers plot is brought in to set the stage for the twin sons of Louis XIII who threatened a dynastic crisis for the Bourbons in France. Rocheford the villain who dies in The Three Musketeers lives here in the person of Ulrich Haupt who takes over the raising of the second born twin in obscurity in the Pyrenees over the Spanish border. Rocheford works on the kid, but being abandoned by his parents will work on you psychologically no matter what the circumstances.\n\nWhen the time is right Haupt strikes and substitutes one twin for the other, both played by William Bakewell. It's bad karma to kill royalty outright so Haupt devises this iron mask to imprison the real Louis XIV so no one knows who he is and thinks him a mad man. \n\nOf course the plot is foiled and Fairbanks repeating the role of D'Artagnan does the foiling together with his musketeer companions of days gone by as they ride one last time for the honor of France.\n\nThe version I saw eschewed subtitles and had a narration supplied by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. who did the dialog with proper \u00e9lan and reverence for his father.

In the course of this drama, director E.A. DuPont devises several more such clock-stopping moments as the star poses behind an etched glass screen or stretches her body in a geometrically beaded gown.\n\nWhen Wong makes her debut before the nightclub audience-- sporting an ersatz Thai get-up and fluttering her fingers this way and that---it is clear that she really can't dance at all, ironically making DuPont's contribution seem even more impressive . When this performance causes an unlikely sensation, rival dancer Gilda Gray gets so jealous that she faints in a heap of feathers. [Famed as the actual creator of the shimmy, Gray demonstrates it here with lots of vigorous jiggling.]\n\nParalleling her rise to dance stardom, Wong's wardrobe gets increasingly elegant, while the conflicts mount: quarreling over nightclub impresario Jameson Thomas [a nicely subtle performance], Gray argues \"He's too old for you!\" and Wong ripostes \"You're too old for him.\" Both have a point. Eventually, with the help of some Limehouse ruffians, a gun, and a dagger, it all ends in a courtoom.\n\nApart from a brief appearance by Charles Laughton as a fastidious diner, DuPont pays no attention to the caf\u00e9 society patrons of the Piccadilly Club. His interest lies with the performers---including skinny Cyril Ritchard as a\nhoofer---and in his own adventurous style: the camera seldom stops moving, once even circling 360 degrees, yet the end impression is not of indulgent artiness. DuPont points the camera down through the whirring blades of overhead fans, or into distorted mirrors---virtuoso effects but somehow serving vitality, a sense of events happening in the moment.\n\nThe distributor, World Wide Pictures, uses the end titles to trumpet its memorable motto: \"Photoplays made where the story's laid\".\n",

But it is Anna May Wong's dazzling performance that stands out, even above everything else in the movie.\n\nSet in the \"Piccadilly\" night club, the story ostensibly stars Jameson Thomas as the club owner, and Gilda Gray as one of the club's star dancers. But it's Wong's character who drives most of the story, and indeed, as soon as Wong comes on screen, it quickly becomes hard to pay much attention to the other characters, except insofar as they interact with her and her plans. The rest of the cast is solid, and there's nothing to criticize about their performances, but they cannot compete with Wong.\n\nWhat makes Wong's performance so stunning is not only her obvious allure, but also the way in which she plays the role. She communicates a great deal about her character's thoughts and feelings by the most economical and well-chosen of gestures and movements, and by so doing she makes her dominance over the other characters quite convincing. Her little smirks can be devastating, and her subtle encouragements can be nearly overwhelming.\n\nThe story is told with good style, making very effective use of lighting and settings to complement the fluid cinematography. The opening sequence is well-conceived, both in pulling the viewer into the world of the characters, and in setting up the story. This part also includes a brief appearance by Charles Laughton in an amusing role.\n\nFrom there, things build up steadily to a melodramatic, twist-filled final 10 minutes or so. The climactic series of events is made more effective by the careful build-up, and by the way that Wong has made Shosho such a vivid and believable character, one who is more than capable of creating strong feelings in the other characters. It all makes \"Piccadilly\" well worth seeing.",

She has that rare, powerful aura that illuminates the screen, like Greta Garbo or Louise Brooks. When her character, Sho-Sho, is in a scene, you can only focus on her, and she carries you away with intensity conveyed by only the merest subtle expression.\n\nThe other actors were \"okay\" but nothing special. The characters of Victor and Mabel, presumably popular and adored dancers, failed to convince me that they had any charisma whatsoever. Sho-Sho's scenes with Valentine, the club owner who wants to make her a star (and his lover) are mesmerising, showing passion and titillating innuendo. But the really interesting relationship is that of Sho-Sho with \"Jim\", a Chinese fellow who seems to live with her -- is he a brother? a lover? it is unclear, but he is totally submissive to her and proud and jealous at the same time. She treats him like a dog, but they obviously have a close bond and need each other.\n\nAs a film in general, \"Picadilly\" is lacking on a few levels, but it is completely redeemed by Anna May Wong's presence.

The look and feel of the film are worth a ten on their own, to be honest, but in reviewing it, I felt I could only give it a good review if it's other elements, plot, acting etc. were up to scratch, and they were too. In the few silent films I've seen, the acting has been very \"stage acting\" over the top and dramatic, so I was expecting to see more hams than I'd see in a butcher, but I got some really great performances, I was really impressed, especially by King Ho Chang who played Jim. Right, plot summary then, the film is about the Piccadilly Club losing it's main attraction, a dancer named Victor, and discovering his successor in the club's own scullery. What then follows is a typical love triangle plot, between the new dancer, Shosho, the club owner, Valentine and Victor's old dance partner, Mabel. As simple as the plot sounds, despite being made 77 years ago it manages to not come off clich\u00e9d, which is a remarkable achievement. The fact that it is a silent film I think helped it in my eyes. To be honest, if this were made as a \"talkie\" I think I would have found it harder to like, as the great constant score gave these images a beautiful dreamlike quality and to strip it away for just a few seconds to hear actors speaking dialogue would have certainly destroyed it. Maybe it was just that Piccadilly was the first really decent silent film I've sat down and paid attention to, maybe it's that I was in the mood for it, or maybe it is just a great film.",

Some lovely late-silent photography, too: Note the frequent shadowplay and the beautiful nightclub interiors, and the evocative tinting. Cyril Ritchard turns up, in his callow-London-dancing-lad days, tall and lean and elegant, as does Charles Laughton, as a drunken boor; both, alas, are gone by the second reel. Wong plies her mysteries-of-the-Orient femininity expertly, not only in dramatic terms but pictorially; nobody worked a camera better. The casual late-Jazz Age racism, too, is fascinating--not just the Limehouse-Chinese-shouldn't-mix-with-whites implications, but an extended sequence of a black Londoner dancing with a white girl.

Her Asian-inspired dancing was, technically speaking, really awful and silly--but the movie extras sure loved it and she became a star--much to the chagrin of the other lady dancer and Anna's boyfriend. Both these people resented that now Anna and the nightclub owner were becoming very cozy. Ultimately, their feelings of betrayal resulted in tragedy, though you'll have to see for yourself what actually occurs.\n\nThe acting is pretty good, the sets are also lovely and the story is mildly engaging. Had the film been about singing and not dancing, it wouldn't have worked so well. But with a nice score by Robert Israel, the film is lovely. Too bad Anna had no idea how to dance and no one bothered to show her how!\n\nBy the way, a there are a few things to look for are in the film. Charles Laughton has a small role as an obnoxious customer and it's his first appearance in a feature film. Also, Anna's boyfriend, Jim, is quite cute when he wears Anna's outfit! And finally, on the inter-title cards, they refer to a pistol as a \"revolver\" even though it is actually a semi-automatic, not a revolver (a tiny mistake, but one that will make gun enthusiasts cringe).",

Piccadilly is set in the heart of Jazz Age London which had everything the American Roaring Twenties had without the inconvenience of Prohibition.\n\nThey were a little more daring across the pond in depicting an interracial romance. Thomas as owner of the nightclub fires half of his club attraction of the dancing team of Mabel and Vic. Vic is played by Cyril Ritchard and he's got a roving eye which distresses Mabel who is Gilda Gray. It distresses Thomas even more who likes Gilda, sort of.\n\nBut when Gray as a solo act doesn't bring in the customers, Thomas looks for a replacement and finds it in the slinky, sexy, sultry Anna May Wong. Wong had previously worked in the scullery at the club and got fired when she did a little impromptu dance entertainment for the staff and a customer complained about a dirty plate. But Thomas and his hormones remembered Wong and they begin an association professional and later personal.\n\nThis interracial triangle ends real bad with one of them dead and the other on trial for murder.\n\nTwo prominent people who had great careers in film had small parts. You have to look quick to spot Ray Milland as one of the tuxedoed bits during the nightclub scene. But it's impossible to forget Charles Laughton in his screen debut. He's the diner who complains about the dirty plate he was given, spoiling Ritchard and Gray's dance and leading to Thomas's discovery of Wong. Even without Laughton's magnificent speaking voice to aid him, watch how he milks that simple scene for all its worth. No doubt this man was going to have a great career.\n\nThere is one other prominent role of significance, that of King Hou Chang as Wong's original boy friend who carries a torch bigger than the one Jameson Thomas has. His performance is quite poignant, I'd love to know what happened to him as Piccadilly is only one of two film credits he has.\n\nThere are some nice shots of London in the Stanley Baldwin-Ramsay MacDonald era incorporated into the film. Piccadilly holds up reasonably well with a plot quite a bit more mature than the era normally would countenance.",

                "text": "This film is Anna May Wong's triumph, but it's worth looking at for the qualities and themes that interested Arnold Bennett. There are quite a few: Bennett's interest in- and relish for- ambition, success, work, rising through the class structure, material pleasure comes over strongly. Indeed, in many ways these are more strongly emphasised than the racial elements. Shosho is just as firmly placed as working-class as Chinese. When she succeeds she becomes \"Miss Shosho\", not \"Shosho\"- in fact it is only through success that she can \"become\" Chinese. When we first see her she is drably and conventionally dressed, with laddered stockings and her body and hands are awkwardly carried; she lives in a squalid room; when she has succeeded she can decorate her flat with Chinoiserie. I would not be surprised if the character of Shosho was not Chinese in the original script but was adapted to suit Anna May Wong. There is only one scene where the racial elements are emphasised- where a black man and a white woman are thrown out of a pub for dancing together- and the scene's sympathy is with the couple, not \"morality\". Equally, Shosho's relationship with Jim makes it plain that he is important in her success as well as a strong personality in his own right. Valentine too is shown as someone who has worked for his success- the first half hour of the film places him in the club he has \"made\"; he first encounters Shosho after a complaint from Charles Laughton as the customer from hell which he deals with ruthlessly by firing Shosho from the scullery. Valentine's two sexual relationships are with women he has created. The dancing is disappointing- Vic and Mabel are skilled enough, but we don't believe they are the toast of London and Shosho's dance is no more convincing as an astonishing and fascinating contrast, but if we suspend disbelief here it's worth doing so. The direction is well-done with skilled and delicate touches of characterisation and placing and the camera-work is good with virtuoso flourishes on the dance floor and the film ends with another touch of Bennett- sandwich-men carrying placards for a show called \"Life Goes On\" past a newspaper with details of Shosho's and Jim's deaths.",

It saw a Wong retrospective here in NYC's Museum of Modern Art, the first biography about Ms. Wong, by Graham Russell Gao Hodges, AND the rerelease of 1929's \"Piccadilly,\" shown for the first time in decades. I so enjoyed this film when I saw it on the big screen that year that I decided to have another look at it on this fresh DVD, and my, how good it does look! A fascinating story of the rise of a young Chinese woman from scullery maid to feature dancer at a posh London nightclub, \"Piccadilly\" is a good introduction to Ms. Wong's many charms for those who have not had the pleasure before, or for those many who enjoyed her work in 1932's \"Shanghai Express\" and have found it hard to see her elsewhere. \"Piccadilly,\" though a late silent, somehow feels strangely modern, and is beautifully shot and marvelously acted by all. The only disappointment for me regarding this DVD rental was with one of the many extras: a panel discussion about Anna May, hosted by B. Ruby Rich in 3/04 at San Francisco's Castro Theatre and including author Hodges AND another legendary Chinese actress, Nancy Kwan. The sound quality of this extra was so extremely echoed and garbled that it was impossible for me to decipher more than a few words of what I'm sure was a fascinating discussion. Doesn't anybody do a quality check on these DVDs before they're released? Whotta disappointment, indeed!",

Jameson Thomas does give a nice performance as nightclub over Valentine Wilmot. The rest of the actors, not so much. The modern-sounding music score is distracting in most places, and some of the dialogue is horrendous.\n\nThere's a very suspenseful, well-acted scene is Wilmot's office when he invites up Anna May Wong's character, Shosho, to discuss having her dance at his club. While they talk, he draws a few caricatures of her on a piece of stationary. Then, when Mabel -- Wilmot's star dance attraction and erstwhile lover -- shows up, he crumples up the drawing and throws it away so she won't see it. Mabel spills water from a vase on Wilmot's desk and retrieves the paper from the waste basket, using it to soak up the water. Shosho watches this unfold, and smirks knowingly as Wilmot tries to hide the drawing from Mabel, and keep his growing affection for Shosho a secret. I thought the scene was worthy of Hitchcock, and follows his definition of true suspense: The audience knows something that a character doesn't.\n\nThe finale, I felt, tries to go a long way out of its way to exonerate Mabel (a white woman) for the murder of Shosho (a Chinese woman) by making Jim (also Chinese) guilty so that the film could have a \"happy white people ending.\" However, logic dictates that Mabel should be guilty of this crime of passion. But then what do you expect from a film that didn't even allow Wilmot and Shosho to kiss on screen because they were of different races (even though that was indicative of the time period in which this film was made)?",

The fact that it's not even listed in Silent Era's website top 100 films is a travesty, when instead it is filled with so much outmoded junk! It's far superior and sophisticated than say Hitchcock's 'The Lodger', which is ranked as Britain's top silent film. The Lodger is in fact a pretty juvenile fare, much like a Lon Chaney film, complete with cartoon characters, and an overused clich\u00e9d lynch mob chase! It would be some time before Hitchcock would mature into the master he would eventually become. In the meantime It's very hard for me to explain why Piccadilly is such pure film. First off, the The acting is first class and very modern, with perhaps Gilda Gray being the weakest link. Cyril Ritchard (who would eventually play Peter Pan's Captain Hook on stage and TV), Jameson Thomas, and King Hou Chang as Jim are all superbly cool! As for Anna May Wong, this is probably her finest hour! Her portrayal as a devilishly, devious minx again is first class, but she's so compelling and visually stunning in this film that's she's iconic! It's also a very cosmopolitan film, but more importantly it's a film about London. Here we get a dual glimpse of a modern jazz age night club, and an alter ego antediluvian world of Limehouse. I could witter on for hours about the merits and greatness of this film, but suffice to say I'll just stop here and say that vision, modernity and transcendence are the key to the success of this film, and leave you with the words of Sam Spade from the Maltese Falcon, that this film is indeed 'the stuff that dreams are made of'.",

It was ironic that Anna had to travel to England to be given a flesh and blood role that allowed her to give an in-depth characterization. Of course after this it was back to America where, apart from the title role in \"Daughter of the Dragon\", it was back to stereo typical Oriental temptress roles - and she even had to compete with Myrna Loy for a time. She was literally given the role of a lifetime in this superb film. Art direction by Alfred Junge has a very decadent 20s Art Nouveau look and the photography by Werner Brandes captures the high society of London's West End (\"This Year of Grace\" is playing) to the seedy cabaret life of \"my Piccadilly\" as Valentine says. Director E.A. Dupont can point to this as a career highlight in a mostly unsatisfactory career. Eventually ending up in Hollywood, the director of the magnificent \"Varietie\" and \"Atlantic\" was given directorial assignments of the calibre of \"Ladies Must Love\" and even \"Hell's Kitchen\" featuring the Dead End Kids. Initially going to Hollywood in 1927 after his triumph with \"Varietie\", he left in disappointment after being given a sentimental melodrama to direct. He went to England and set up his own distribution company - World Wide Pictures - \"Photoplays Made Where the Story's Laid\" and the first movie made was \"Moulin Rouge\". Even though it was filmed mostly at Elstree, it was a great success and for his next movie Dupont turned to an actual locale in London with Piccadilly. The film was based on a novel by Arnold Bennett and the author also supplied his own scenario.\n\nVic and Mabel (Cyril Richard and Gilda Gray), the top dance act, are the talk of the town - so say the patrons of the Piccadilly Club. And what a club, with an inhouse orchestra of the DeBroy Somers Band (they were one of Britain's premier dance bands of the 20s, it was a pity some of their music couldn't have been incorporated into the soundtrack instead of the rather cheesy score). With a curved balcony and arched staircase overlooking a magnificent ballroom, the setting is super. Valentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) is the jaded manager (is there any other kind)??? - as one diner says he started the club and he made it!!!\n\nAn incident involving a dirty plate (Charles Laughton has a cameo as a disgruntled customer) leads Valentine to the scullery where he discovers Shosho (Wong). Her tantalizing dancing on the tabletop distracts the dishwashers from their work so when Victor departs for America, hoping to leave the club in the lurch, Valentine brings in Shosho as his new dancing star. Mabel (who has a secret yen for Valentine) is horrified - \"She can't dance, they'll laugh at her - and you!!\" Of course Shosho is a sensation, her shimmering dance leaves the audience spellbound and Mabel distraught as she knows she will no longer be the toast of London!!!\n\nValentine now begins an affair with Shosho - her \"intended\", Jim, is unhappy, he accidentally sees the mascot he gave her, a tiny Buddha, in Valentine's office - she said she lost it, but someone else is not quite pleased about it either!!! The sensational ending is soon yesterday's news as an excited tipster in more concerned with his race winnings than the sordid headlines and as the new variety show says \"Life Goes On\"!!!\n\nJameson Thomas was dissatisfied with his career in British movies so went to Hollywood where he was continually cast as a villain or lounge lizard (\"Extravagance\", \"It Happened One Night\"). Gilda Gray had a patchy career - her private life was far more exciting but all her movies gave her a chance to dance the shimmy - the dance she made famous!!!",

While Clive and Mabel might look the part, they're no Fred and Ginger, part of the reason perhaps being that Clive has a major case of the hots for Mabel, who only has eyes for suave Valentine. Things turn sour for Mabel, however, after Clive dissolves the partnership in a huff after she rebuffs his advances once too often, and then Valentine starts getting cosy with his new female dancer, the sultry Sho-Sho (Anna May Wong). Of course, it's only a matter of time before emotions come to the boil.\n\nPiccadilly is a movie about sex. It's about the interaction of adults, and the consequences of actions taken through selfish motives. While there are no real villains in this piece (even though there is a murder), nobody comes out of it untarnished by the events that unfold, although one character emerges surprisingly unchanged. For all its melodramatic tendencies (which are forgivable given the era in which it was made), Piccadilly is quite a remarkable film. Presaging film noir by more than a decade, German director E. A. Dupont's mobile camera makes wonderful use of light and shadow to illustrate the archetypal noir ambiance created by Arnold Bennett's account of the dark passions at play in the superficial environment of the swish Piccadilly nightclub. The camera sweeps across a limehouse saloon filled with rummies and whores with as much relish as it roams the nightclub crammed with bejewelled ladies in gowns and men in dinner suits. It is this rich canvas of sumptuously captured images that overcomes the shortfalls in acting and storyline to deliver a film that is really better than it ought to be. While there are some nice touches in the script \u0096 Wilmott, for instance, after watching Clive and Mabel's unconvincing dance performance, travels from club to kitchen to scullery, where he spies Sho-Sho performing a sultry shimmy on a worktop for the entertainment of her workmates, thus linking most of the protganists and depictng their relative social status in one economical and effective sequence \u0096 once Bennett has to concentrate on driving the storyline forward, he seems too willing to fall back on increasingly melodramatic plot points that must have been clich\u00e9d even back in '29.\n\nAlthough third-billed, Anna May Wong is far and away the star of this movie. Looking remarkably contemporary with her bobbed 'Louise Brooks' hair and her clever facial gestures, she steals every single scene in which she appears, and manages, with the help of one of the screenplay's other strong points, to present ShoSho as a femme fatale without making her out to be a ruthless schemer on the make. Gilda Gray, the star of the piece \u0096 although Thomas gets more screen-time than both of the ladies \u0096 gives a melodramatic performance by comparison. She looks a little like Garbo, but that's the only resemblance between them.\n\nThe BFI DVD comes with an optional five-minute sound prologue that leaves the viewer thankful they are watching the silent version. The static camera shows Thomas and his co-actor speak their lines like Cholmondeley-Warner and pal in all those Harry Enfield sketches \u0096 evidence indeed that the cinema took a brief but major step backward with the advent of sound.",

There are two major musical numbers in the film, and it would have really accentuated them to have the music of the times in the film rather than the modern score that just doesn't seem to fit. Unfortunately, British films didn't convert to sound until 1930, so this film remains as a \"silent musical\".\n\nIt's a very good film that is basically about how life goes on, and today's celebrities and scandals are quickly forgotten tomorrow. It also shows the flimsy basis in many cases for being considered talented. The female headliner of the night club is basically there because she is the owner's girlfriend and is being carried to a large degree by her dance partner. When he decides to leave England and try to make it on Broadway, the owner knows the score and seeks a novelty to fill in what he has lost. He sees Anna May Wong's character dancing in the night club scullery and fires her for it, but later he realizes that maybe an exotic act is what he needs to draw an audience. He rehires her as a dancer. He is captivated by both the girl and her act, and at this point the film takes a sharp turn and becomes a bit of a crime drama and mystery.\n\nAnna May Wong is probably the only performer most American audiences will recognize with one fleeting exception.

                "text": "There are three reasons to watch Piccadilly, a 1929 British silent backstage melodrama. The performance of Anna May Wong is primary. She's a knockout as Shosho, a Chinese dishwasher in a posh London nightclub who gets a chance to show how she can dance, and then becomes a star. Wong is so charismatic, so fine a performer and so confident an actress, that you might wonder whatever happened to her. But there's more to Piccadilly than Wong. Perhaps not too much, but enough to enjoy the passing parade of dated movie choreography and the moody atmosphere of transplanted German expressionism. The downside is the story...one of those behind-the-scenes melodramas of entertainers and impresarios, stilted and dated, filled with tremulous glances, suspicious glares, clutched hankies and faces turned away. \n\nValentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) owns the Piccadilly Club, the poshest of the posh, where the sophisticates of London cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, dressed to the nines, come to dance and dine, and to watch Mabel & Vic, \"London's Greatest Dance Attraction.\" Wilmot is a tough, smooth, perfectionist. He made the Piccadilly what it is. He discovered Mabel Greenfield (Gilda Gray) and made stars out of her and her dance partner, Vic Smiles (Cyril Ritchard). While he appreciates Mabel's talents, his nightclub comes first. Mabel really loves the guy and Vic really loves Mabel. (\"My dear, I'm simply mad about you!\") One night a diner is given a dirty plate. He makes a scene; Wilmot is furious and storms into the kitchen and scullery. There he sees Shosho, dancing on a table for the other workers when she should have been washing dishes. He fires her. Then he has second thoughts. Shosho has something that the impresario in Wilmot tells him might make a star attraction...exotic, sensuous, unusual. It's not long before Shosho is a smash. By this time Vic has left, Shosho finds it no trouble at all to delightfully snare Wilmot (in probably the best scene in the movie) and Mabel is jealous. Into this hot stew of fervid emotions, a shot rings out, scandal ensues, a trial is held...justice, both criminal and moral, is served up. And in that great tradition of melodramatic showbiz...life goes on with a million more stories undoubtedly waiting to be told. The storyline is a slog. \n\nStill, the big dance number with Mabel & Vic at the start of the movie is a delight of dated style. Mabel and Vic each come prancing down the two grand staircases that bracket the Piccadilly's elegant dance floor, he in tails, she in a swirling gown, and off they go. It's one of those tricky, ricky-ticky fast numbers where elbows and feet fly about, complete with winking glances of mischievous fun. It goes on and on, with Vic and Mabel each having a chance to shine. Mabel flirts and shows her legs. Vic with slicked back hair seductively grins with the silent nasal charm of Jack Buchanan or No\u00ebl Coward. It's the kind of well-meaning, \"classy\" dance that Fred Astaire drove a stake through four years later in Flying Down to Rio. However, watch this number with affection. It does no harm and at one time held the paying movie customers in thrall. \n\nThe look of the film is all moody atmosphere. This isn't enough to salvage the movie by itself, but it gives Piccadilly a lot of visual class. \n\nAnd then there's Anna May Wong, an actress of talent, style and screen presence. She's featured in the billing but she dominates the movie. She comes straight through the camera to us, sexy and innocent, calculating and surprised, whose dancing captures us and whose acting tells us here is a woman to pay attention to. As an actress of Chinese descent, she hadn't a chance in Hollywood except as a stereotype. In the Twenties she finally left for Europe and had a few star roles in Germany and England, but then returned to Hollywood with a contract that seemed to assure her of star Hollywood roles. The contract didn't say major star roles with star male leads. She lost the leads in The Good Earth and Dragon Seed because producers said she looked too Chinese. She had to watch as Luise Rainer and Katherine Hepburn starred, both gussied up in some of the oddest \"Chinese\" eyelids and makeup Hollywood ever devised. Anna May Wong wound up playing characters with names like Su Lin, Lin Ying, Lan Ying and, in an explosion of Hollywood creativity, Lan Ying Lin. (I'm not kidding: Impact, Bombs Over Burma, Dangerous to Know and Daughter of Shanghai.) Then there was Ling Moy, Kim Ling, A-hsing, Lois Ling and, of course, Chinese Woman. (Daughter of the Dragon, Island of Lost Men, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ellery Queen's Penthouse Mystery and Producers' Showcase) \n\nSo put Piccadilly in the DVD player, probably with your finger on the fast-forward button, to watch Mabel & Vic in their big number and, most of all, to watch a woman who could have been a great star if it hadn't been for Hollywood. \n\nThe DVD restoration looks much better than one might expect. However, you'll probably best enjoy the screen music, written for the restoration, if you also enjoy the incessant chatter of those golf announcers who can't keep their mouths shut. The music never stops. This is one DVD where it pays to watch the extras before you watch the movie. The audio is not good on \"Dangerous to Know: The Life and Legacy of Anna May Wong,\" but the feature is informative.",

Mabel, played by Gilda Gray, is the top dancer at the club. Shosho is picked to be a dancer when Mabel's act begins to wane. Anna May Wong looks beautiful and sexy in the role, wearing a costume probably not unlike Josephine Baker's at the same time. Ms. Wong went to Europe to make films and star on the stage when her American roles dried up. It was definitely our loss. In this film, she is both coquettish and a vamp. She steals the show, though Gilda Gray is very good also. One thing I also liked was the music, it was horn laden jazz.

                "text": "I first saw this film at the live premiere of Neil Brand's new jazz score; everyone was raving about it but I felt I must be missing something, and put it down to the music. (Attractive jazz, but not especially closely tied in to the action -- I've heard Neil Brand do immeasurably better on the piano.) Having seen it again I think I've worked out what's wrong, and it wasn't the music at all. In fact, with hindsight, the new score had actually managed to improve the film.\n\nThe trouble with this picture -- apart of course from the hand-waving explanation at the ending, worthy of Agatha Christie at her most contrived -- is its characters. Specifically, the reason why I don't warm to this 'classic', for all its technical experimentation and fluid deployment of intertitles, is that there are simply no characters whom I actually like and/or care about, so I find it very hard to get engaged in what happens to them.\n\nMabel is a manipulative drama queen who only got where she is by sleeping with the boss; she comes across as so artificial and dislikeable in the early scenes that it is impossible to feel much sympathy for her downfall. Jim, the other character who is in some sense a victim of events, is largely a background cipher, and while his situation is unenviable we don't get enough sense of him as a person, let alone of his relationship with Shosho, to be able to empathise with his prolonged attempts at strangulation. Victor (expertly played by stage dancing star Cyril Ritchard, of whom we see too little) is clearly a cad, while Valentine Wilmot is a predatory middle-aged employer. Shosho, whom one might expect to be the heroine, turns out to be as manipulative, bitchy and grasping as Mabel. All in all they are none of them very attractive, and the films fails to enlist audience sympathies to follow the fate of any one of them.\n\nPerhaps it's childish of me, but I find that I need to become exercised over the outcome for the characters in order to find any emotional appeal in a film. \"Piccadilly\" I find a strangely unmoving spectacle.\n\nOn rewatching I also find it hard to see the purpose of the lengthy 'interracial' sequence at the bar, other than politics. If the intent is (very obliquely) to illustrate that it will not be acceptable for Shosho to have a public relationship with a white man, then it's odd that this element turns out to be almost completely irrelevant to the events that in fact transpire. The barrier that Shosho has to overcome is that of her working-class origin rather than her foreign face: given the plot as written, she could equally well be a little Cockney ballet dancer (like Jessie Matthews, busy starring at that time in \"This Year of Grace\") picked out of the gutter by a wealthy patron as a speciality act to put the established performers' noses out of joint.\n\nOn reflection I think I'd revise my original vote downwards to 6/10; worth watching out of curiosity if it turns up, but not worth seeking out. (But watch for the background period detail! -- including the famous \"Centre of the World\" sign on the London Pavilion...)",

The tempo is a bit faster paced than usual (although there are still spots that drag), and the character relationships are not explored fully, which makes the ending rather ambiguous when the murderer turns out to be a character never fully defined.\n\nBut somehow these murky elements don't effect the overall power of the storytelling here. It starts briskly with some quick views of the Piccadilly area of London at night (tinted blue) accompanied by a perky score that is sometimes a bit too busy throughout. After the credits it switches to sepia for much of the story involving a nightclub act by GILDA GRAY and CYRIL RITCHARD that is disbanded when manager JAMESON THOMAS discharges Ritchard who is becoming too attached to his dancing partner. Thomas then happens to spy ANNA MAY WONG giving an impromptu dance before her co-workers in the galley and decides to hire her as a dance specialty, much to the dismay of Gilda Gray.\n\nWong performs an erotic dance in gilded Chinese costume in an extraordinarily well photographed scene which is met with audience approval and this sets up the jealousy angle between Wong and Gray. In the meantime, we catch the furtive glances of a Chinese man who assists Anna's act and seems intent on throwing dagger-like glances at the manager whom he knows is entering into a romantic relationship with her.\n\nThe end result is a crime of passion that is handled with some subtlety by director Arnold Bennett. There's an almost Agatha Christie touch to the courtroom ending which has a plot twist for a final surprise.\n\nAs others have said, this is indeed a \"hidden treasure\" among the silent screen films and is really worth watching unless silent films are not your thing at all.

                "text": "This is an absolutely superb film, far too little known and still much underestimated. It is of particular interest as it was made on what you might call the fragile border of the European cinema tradition in the land that has so often, politically, economically and culturally been the Continent's US \"Trojan Horse\". But it was made at a particular moment when the British had, briefly at any rate, partially escaped their infeodation vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and become more open to tbe influence of other European cinema. It was a period (1928-1933) when a real effort at inra-European co-operation was being made (at least in th world of cinema), when there were many co-productions, often resulting in multiple versions of films in different languages (mainlyl French, German and English) and with slightly different casts in each country.\n\nAlthough this film does not come in that category, it was one of several films made in Britain at this time by German directors, which clearly show the influence of German cinema, in the superb cinematography, in the emphasis on \"ensemble\" acting, in the relatively slow pace and, for most of the film, lack of melodramatic action. The editing and the use of close-up, in the European manner, does not privilege \"continuity\" (ping-ponging backwards and forwards between the characters in the classic US fashion) but instead concentrates on \"connectivity\" (psychological and thematic relevance). The influence of naturalism (most strongly associated with Germany at this time under the name \"neue Sachlichgkeit\" or \"new objectivity\") is there, in, for instance, the fine scene set in a lower-class London dance-hall. Subjects are introduced that would have been taboo for US film-makers (the raising of the issue of racial prejudice and racial segregation in that same scene)and, while the style is delightfully elliptical and non-explicit, the film has a sexual pulse that is again typical of European film, while US equivalents rarely rise above mild prurience.\n\nDupont was a fine director both with regard to cinematography and with regard to acting and this is clear from the performances he elicits from all the principals, in all there cases better performances than they would produce or, in where Wong was concerned, be given the chance to produce, in any other films. Since the comparison with Von Sternberg has been raised by other viewers, I have to say that I find Piccadilly distinctly superior to any of Von Sternberg's silent films and better indeed than anything Von Sternberg ever did with the exception - admittedly a very notable one - of his one German film, Der blaue Engel. If Dupont's career went down the drain it was through little fault of his own. Both he and Anna May Wong were notable casualties of the restrictive US system and in both cases it represented a shameful waste of talent. Wong's story is well known - how racism and stereotyping ensured that she never came near to fulfilling her potential.\n\nDupont was a casualty of a certain Herr Hitler who took it into his head to destroy what was, to my mind incontestably, the finest cinema industry of the world at the time. He became part of the great exodus of talent from Germany that would be the US' great gain but a gain it often did not know how properly to profit from. While it is true some German/Austrian/Hungarian expatriates had little problem with the restrictive nature of Hollywood cinema, notably \"the playboy Lubitsch\" (as Graham Greene once called him, who had come to the US rather earlier (1926) and of his own accord and could adapt to anything. Eclectic directors who did not much mind what they worked on or how it was chopped about (Michael Curtiz for instance) fared well enough. Younger directors, who had had relatively little experience of the German system (Billy Wilder for example) also adapted without problems.\n\nBut for many the US experience was something of a nightmare after the much freer and more expressive cinema world they were used to. Even F. W.Murnau who came at around the same time as Lubitsch and been given unusual lattitude because he was regarded as such a valuable \"catch\", after making one of his best films (Sunrise), soon found himself at continual loggerheads with the US production system. Fritz Lang, whose first US film, Fury, is also arguably the best of those he made there, had a successful enough career on the surface but talked long and often of the bitterness and artistic frustration he felt over his US experience. Dupont, who had had little success with an earlier US film (1927), was not regarded as a \"catch\" in the same way and found himself relegated after 1933 to the making of B-films. It is possible to make excellent B-films (another expatriate Edgar Ullmer is a fine but rare example) but it was not easy and required a very particular, almost perverse, talent that Dupont lacked. Sickened by the experience, he abandoned directing almost completely in 1940 (making only a couple of bread-and-butter films again at the end of his life.\n\nIt is rather fitting that, in 1929, Britain, a sort of halfway-house in some sense, should have provided a haven both for Dupont and Wong to show what exceptional talents they both were.",

Until now, just having seen this very rare feature, I'd only been exposed to their hugely successful phonograph recordings, their late Educational shorts, and the severely awful Sennett film, HYPNOTIZED. So I've always thought of them as pretty bad, with Amos n' Andy very quickly surpassing them in the early 1930s, and it's obvious why-they could be funny.\n\nNow I see that M & M could be funny, and the scenes of their re-created Broadway show act prove it. They do the (by then) years old \"Early bird gets the Worm\" routine, and it was very amusing, because unlike the records, you can see it as a performance. So I was happily surprised. The rest of the film is the old, old story of partners split up by a no-good dame that breaks up the act, then,a lesson learned and they get back together. The payoff scene has Mack, unconscious in a hospital bed, touch and go, but ebbing fast, and Moran, in a desperate bid to snap him out of it, is pulled from the theatre without taking the time to remove his minstrel makeup, and dressed as a convict to boot. Nothing works until he tearfully calls out their act's feeder lines, and with that, he responds and tearfully wakes up and a great big happy tearful relief takes over. It's ludicrous, but since this kind of Victoriana was regularly staged for laughs, we can assume that only the most backward audience would take it seriously in 1929, too.",

The clown performs his act, and it is then the circus master's turn. He attempts to tame a lion by dancing with it, but the lion beats up the circus master, and the clown laughs at him. The circus master, enraged at this humiliation, decides to screw up the clown's next act by putting an entire barrel's worth of gunpowder into the cannon, and lighting it right when the clown enters. The clown is then hurled into the sky, and the circus master and the horse rider go to a private room, where the horse rider caresses the circus master. The circus clown falls into the room, and is heartbroken to see the incident.

For such a very early talkie it's an astonishingly confident film, one of the first UFA 'operettas' yet with a contemporary, rather than period, setting. The Comedian Harmonists put in a guest spot as barbershop-style singing barmen, Olga Tschechowa appears in a supporting role and Werner Richard Heymann's marvelous music helps it all move along at a swift pace. This is a perennially popular Weimar-era German musical, and deservedly so.",

                "text": "\"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\" (Three Good Friends) is really a charming film. It was released in 1930, so I guess it was filmed in 1929. As the Great Crash happened in 24th October of that year and the crisis effects would only be felt in Europe some months later, I think the film was not an answer to the Great Depression (but it could as well be). Germany, anyway since the end of the First World War lived in a state of permanent crisis, but as we know crisis can many times stimulate the creativity - see the German Expressionism and see also, for instance, \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\" - Yeah! Art is not just Murnau, Fritz Lang etc.., it can be represented by a musical comedy like \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\" (Three from the Gasoline Station).\n\n\"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\" tells the story of three rich friends that suddenly lose everything they have (this tastes like Depression!), including house, furniture and all, and have to work for the first time in their lives. They open a gasoline station and meet a girl that will conquer their three hearts. This intrigue will challenge their friendship. This is the basis of the story that is punctuated by hilarious gags and musical numbers. This is really a feel-good film, that at the same time is very creative and funny. The actors look like they are having lots of fun.\n\nHighly recommended! I don't understand why this film is not mentioned together with other great musical films. And pay attention: This is not just another film with an indifferent plot sprinkled with musical numbers - music and plot work very well together and the result is this charming film. Go for it!",

The reason may be the inclusion of Heinz R\u00fchmann, even if the story and list of cast members makes it obvious that Willy Fritsch was still a much bigger star in Germany at that point than R\u00fchmann. 3 years before the Nazis came into power, we have a light operetta movie with lots of romance here. No hard feelings though and no serious drama either. They had the possibility to include that too, but I guess they wanted something light because the music parts and, of course, the lesson on friendship would not have worked so well otherwise.\n\nThen again, it did not work really well. The action does not make sense for the most part in my opinion and I was not impressed by any of the aspects of the film. There are a couple catchy songs, but overall the music is as forgettable as the comedy, the story and the acting. By some, it may be considered one of the best German comedy films, but in my opinion, it is far far away from such a title. I guess those who say so, just need to watch more German comedies. R\u00fchmann himself rarely has the opportunity to show us what he is capable because otherwise we may forget that Fritsch (besides Harvey) is the star here. A fairly forgettable 90 minutes I must say. I was not really entertained well. I am a bit surprised to see the people who wrote/directed this one managed to have successful careers in Hollywood afterward. I guess they must have stepped things up later on, because here they really do not show us quality filmmaking. Thumbs down for \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\". I don't recommend it.",

The scene where Lilian (Lilian Cossmann) to the gas station and meets the second attendant Kurt (Oskar Karlweis) is quite something. Kurt starts singing about how she's just a woman and needs a man with her. There's all these references to women and driving. On the one hand, he's trying to find an excuse to let him ride with her. On the other hand, it reminds me of this Schwachsinn in Saudi Arabia that denies women the right to drive. Now, Europe is being flooded with Muslim immigrants who apparently can't run their own country to go to a country that was more progressive than much of the Arab world is today about 80 years ago.\n\nAnd that's what so much of this early German really is - a relic. This is a rather silly, light-hearted comedy perfect for TMC with no moral or ethic implications and little connection to the reality of the day. Yet it is still studied because it was a very financially successful, early talkie. \n\nThe dance scenes are fairly entertaining. Whenever the three men are together, it's funny and the lyrics are quite clever. However, such films seem typical of that escapism. It's no shocker that, in a world where people make such fluffy, good-for-nothing films, street battles and concentration camps would be the norm. \n\nSo how do I reconcile the progressive situation of Weimar Germany with its predilection to mass murder? Well both the Muslim world and Nazi Germany engaged in it, but at least women could drive in one of them. It's the little things.",

Brigitte Helm, one of Europe's most intriguing vamps of the 20s and early 30s this time gives a different interpretation of the same part she had in the silent version two years ago. She not only portrays Alraune, the artificially created girl who brings down men by the dozen but also her mother, a prostitute who agrees to take part in an experiment of artificial insemination and even performs as a singer in a bar reminiscent of \"The blue angel\" (which was produced around the same time). In this film, Alraune, when finding out about her true identity, feels remorse over her deeds and in the end commits suicide. The film, much more than the silent version, is a daring mix of sex and crime and must have been rather scandalous at its time. Oswald does an excellent job in recreating the atmosphere of Wilhelminian Germany in the beginning of the film and then creates sexual tension and suspense in the house of Professor ten Brinken, where Alraune plays around with men like the toys in her bedroom. Great performances by Albert Bassermann as her creator/ stepfather who falls for her and Harald Paulsen, who also starred in Oswalds horror classic \"Unheimliche Geschichten\". Another classic from the rich period of German cinema before 1933 and a film that could never have been made that way in Hollywood.",

Ben Bard, as the gangster Mary Astor is hooked up with in the early parts of the film, is dapper, slick, and suitably despicable in his bad man role, John Boles is his usual self, kind of boring but adequate.

A programmer in length only, the lack of big names gave this movie an almost documentary look and all the players impress. With names like Derby Dan and Champagne Joe, not to mention gorgeous gals, you are instantly plunged into the smoky, sleazy world of speakeasies were thuggish racketeers pimp their down trodden hostesses onto drunken businessmen in an effort to get them to spend up a storm!! Judy Andrews (Astor) as well as looking out of place in that smoked filled atmosphere, is fed up with cheap crooks and cheap rackets - returning from her mother's funeral puts her life into focus.\n\nBen Bard, an unknown actor to me but his \"Derby Dan\" is an elegant but vicious thug who twists Mary's arm (literally) in an effort to get her to hand over her weekly salary. That is the straw that finally breaks the camel's back but the \"jovial out of towner\" also has his problems. He has been robbed and is bounced out of the club before he can make a fuss - right out in front of a police car and boy, is he ready to name names for Detective Edwin Burke (Robert Elliott, soon to be a fixture as a Hollywood cop). The evening ends with Champagne Joe (Oscar Apfel) looking at a lengthy stretch in the big house - and vowing to get the dirty so and so who stealthily slipped the wallet into his coat pocket (no prizes for guessing it was Derby Dan)!!\n\nMeanwhile Burke has recognized the soulful girl he saw earlier that day, grieving her mother's death but even though he is shocked to see she works at the club, he believes her story of trying to go straight and turns a blind eye. With a little bit of help ($10) from Burke, Judy starts a new life as a laundress - until seeing Dan through a window rattles her and she loses her job!! Next up is a waitress in a gentleman's lunch room - \"must have good figure\". Quite a few innovative scenes - when she first starts applying for jobs - the camera pans away as she climbs the stairs, indicative of her climb out of the gutter and towards clean air!!\n\nAs well as waitressing, she also studies secretarial skills at night school - boy is this girl keen!! She soon catches the eye of her new boss, Stephen Ransome (John Boles) who after a few dates regrets the fact that he will soon be in need of a new secretary!! Judy tries to keep her past a secret but at the court where they stop off to get married she is just in time to see Derby Dan get sentenced to prison for larceny. He recognises her but fortunately her guardian angel in the shape of Detective Burke is there to protect her from Dan's menacing looks. Two years later Dan is out, tracks Judy down and to her frantic question \"What do you want\"? his response is \"Plenty\"!! He takes her jewels and demands $5,000 for their return or \"I'll tell poppa\" - but Judy has an ace up her sleeve, her good buddy Detective Burke!!\n\nA discreet word in Champagne Joe's ear and \"that's the greatest public improvement since the subway\" according to one eager policeman.\n\nPlaying \"Blondey Nell\" a gorgeous hostess, was the beauteous Helen Lynch who had been a 1924 Wampas Baby Star. While she appeared in a couple of prestigious films (\"The Singing Fool\", \"Underworld\" and \"In Old Arizona\") her roles were small and she retired for marriage with Carroll Nye in the early thirties. Ben Bard, so convincing as Derby Dan, was initially signed by Fox as a leading man but the air of quiet menace he bought to his roles meant he was often typecast as a heavy.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

The plot line founders toward the end but, as a whole, DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is notable for its arresting visuals and set-piece sequences. Unfortunately, we'll never see G.W. Pabst's original intent:\n\n\"THE DIARY OF A LOST GIRL was based on the moralistic novel by Margarete Bohme... But the censors did not miss the point. They butchered DIARY more brutally than PANDORA. In the ending Pabst intended, Thymiane was to become the proprietress of her own high-class brothel, rejecting respectability in favor of the wealth and power that a rotten bourgeoisie could respect. But the censors insisted that Thymiane embrace precisely the kind of sentimental reformism that Pabst disdained, twisting the film into conformity with German middle-class values. Pabst capitulated because he had to coexist with them and because he would live to fight another day for such subsequent (and better) films as ...THE THREEPENNY OPERA... DOALG was a kind of sacrificial lamb, as its scenarist, Rudolf Leonhardt, affirms: 'Pabst's accommodating nature had already made him prepared to make two different endings -for vice, even involuntary vice, must not go rewarded. Where the censors had not forbidden passages beforehand, entire filmed sequences were cut without mercy later on...'\" \n\nI love what there is of it (especially the brothel & reformatory scenes), but I was never in the majority:\n\n\"But it was death, rather than immortality, that awaited DOALG at the box office upon its release... The influential critic Hans G. Lustig gave it a single withering paragraph in 'Der Tempel'... No serious criticism of DOALG could take place until three decades later...Lost on most critics was the fact that Pabst's technique in DOALG was different from that of PANDORA. Lotte Eisner, virtually alone, recognized a new, semi-documentary restraint: 'Pabst now seeks neither Expressionistic chiaroscuro nor Impressionistic glitter; and he seems less intoxicated than he was by the beauty of his actress.\"\n\nHighly recommended!",

It also features a fine performance by Louise Brooks. Her performance in \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" is on a par with that in \"Pandora's Box\", her other celebrated collaboration with G.W. Pabst.\n\nThe story has Brooks as a pharmacist's daughter whose young life is drastically changed by events that she can only dimly understand. From then on, she must endure a variety of trials while gradually learning some important lessons, often with only the barest help from those around her. The role contrasts nicely with her role in \"Pandora's Box\". Both in that film and in \"Diary of a Lost Girl\", she has the same level of energy and appeal, but in the former movie, right from the beginning she was very much the catalyst for the other characters' actions, while here she begins as an innocent youth who is completely at the mercy of all of the others, and then grows as the movie proceeds.\n\nThe settings are well-chosen so as both to contrast with her character, and to develop it. Her experiences show many aspects of the seamier side of both human nature and human living, and yet this is by no means a mere gratuitous display of sordidness, but rather a growing experience for Brooks's character. It culminates in an uplifting finale that is all the more effective for having arisen from material that is by no means idealistic.\n\nThe expressionistic style in the photography, lighting, and sets enhances the atmosphere and also the effectiveness of the story and the characters. The slightly stylized nature of both works quite well, and all of this contributes significantly to the high quality of the movie.",

And like no one else probably could now that movies have filled out all the sensory space they can. And we have come to expect information in those channels.\n\nFor instance, can you imagine a movie today just showing people dancing? No story information, no bizarre or comic behavior to amuse us, just people dancing. This has three or four such scenes.\n\nI'll leave it for others to speculate on how such an on screen presence happened to be possible, except to say that much must come from the nuance of the eye, all the things associated with the camera and its context. I pay attention particularly to placement and movement, here not obviously novel but intimate nonetheless.\n\nWhat a woman! Between she and Clara Bow \u0097 these two women alone \u0097 we changed.\n\nBut the other reason I put this on my \"must watch\" list is because of the sheer virtuosity of the film-making.\n\nRealize that the hardest thing for a filmmaker is to start. How do you begin? You have to create a world, a feel, a system of mechanics and fate. You have to create a situation with context and characters. You have to have a story with events and pull. All this you need to build in a couple minutes and do it in such a way that the viewer is not only fully familiar and comfortable but swept along, she begs for more.\n\nPay attention to the first few moments of this. If you haven't seen it dear reader, remember that this is a *silent* movie, that there is no rolling text to tell you what is happening, and there haven't been several months of previews that tell you the whole darn story.\n\nIn just a few minutes you learn:\n\nIt is christening day for Thymiane (whose name we learn) and as a gift from a live-in aunt she gets the diary from which we know what we see later will be drawn.\n\nWe learn that she is the daughter of a successful chemist who lives in an opulent house above the pharmacy. That below lives an assistant chemist who is obsessed by sex. We discover that she has a bossy set of relatives who turn a blind eye to her father's dalliances.\n\nAnd that one of those dalliances impregnates her governess who then kills herself. Meanwhile, the downstairs chemist has designs on the young girl and makes the first entry in her diary.\n\nThe story is off.\n\nI dare say that there is no other movie in existence that conveys this much information so compactly and so directly. The way it is done today is by reference to other movies. You enter today's movies with all sorts of tacit knowledge about other movies that is recalled and activated by codes. \n\nHere, it is all done the old fashioned way, cinematically.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",

Her escape from the institution leads her to a brothel, where she spends her life until her father's death...when her life changes.

Louise Brooks portrays the innocent Thymiane with such pathos that I wanted to reach out to the screen and rescue her. Unlike most films from this period there is no rescue in \"the nick of time\". Events follow an inexorable nightmare pattern as Thymiane, the victim, is condemned to imprisonment after being raped and impregnated by her father's employer. Abandoned financially and emotionally by her selfish father she can only fall into prostitution after she escapes the home for wayward girls. I couldn't help being reminded of \"The Magdalene Sisters\", another film where girls are blamed for the lustful acts of their attackers and seducers. Louise Brooks expresses more with her eyes then most actors do with paragraphs of dialogue. Even during the giddiest parties in the brothel she expresses desperation, despair and regret with rare subtlety. Despite its' age and the lack of sound the film stands up well. The presentation is not overly sentimentalized, though the enduring \"goodness\" of the Thymiane and her eventual \"redemption\" might stretch the imagination. In an age where \"human trafficking\" is running rampant we could use an actress of such beauty, charisma, and sympathy to portray the continuing plight of girls and women driven into the sordid life of prostitution.",

She looks fantastic, her smile (when it actually appears in this somewhat melodramatic film) so captivating. But even the characters around her were fascinating too, and the way they were filmed.\n\nIt seems to me that with current technology, we can watch a silent movie like this now adjusted to what we understand to be a movement of characters to a pace more like our own, not the slightly quickened pace that we're used to seeing in silent films. I haven't seen the film in its original form, so I can't make an accurate assessment as to whether it unspools a bit more quickly simply due to projectors of the era, or the way it was filmed - the point is this: watching a movie such as this Pabst classic now adjusted to a more realistic pace does seem to make one appreciate them more in a strangely contemporary context. Though we still note the differences in clothing and appearance of the people, they all seem more identifiable somehow. But I swear, I spent a few minutes wondering if I had stumbled onto a contemporary silent-film imitation of some type! Oops! \n\nI experienced something similar recently when watching a screening of Murnau's \"Sunrise\" - the film and its characters somehow transcended their era. Though part of me wonders if that film also had its pacing adjusted technologically, there was a human dimension to it that made me push aside any preconceived notions of silent cinema and just enjoyed it as a tale well told, beautifully filmed, and amazingly acted. This film has the same effect - though I think it was actually I who transcended my era by experiencing it.",

It is far better than the overlong \"Pandora's Box\", and the more I have thought about it the stranger it seems that \"Dairy of a Lost Girl\" should not be more famous than its overblown predecessor.\n\nThe fame of \"Pandora's Box\" is attributable to the image and presentation of Louise Brooks as an archetype - not unlike a mannequin or fashion plate for a generation of 'liberated' German girls. \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" is forgotten despite its artistic superiority and the revelation that Brooks was not just a sensational beauty but a very fine actress to boot. In most of her films Brooks was called upon to pose, and perhaps to smirk - and she did it very well, but she was not asked to do any more, which might have explained her mounting frustration with the American movie business.\n\nAfter she completed \"Pandora's Box\" she sailed back to the U.S.A., perhaps expecting to be treated with greater consideration by the Paramount executives who had been driven to distraction by her uncompromising (selfish?) working methods. The long suffering managing executive B. P. Shulberg offered her a much higher salary in order to turn her last American silent, \"The Canary Murder Case\" (which I have not seen) into a talkie. Oddly, she viewed this as an insult and treated Shulberg with undeserved contempt. Having destroyed her relationship with Adolph Zukor's Paramount she returned to G. W. Pabst in 1929 - she presumably hoped that Hom-Film would be a more accommodating employer. Accommodating, that is, of her increasingly erratic and temperamental work habits, which were lubricated by a heroic consumption of alcohol.\n\nPabst obviously had a great affection for her (who wouldn't, even allowing for her often lamentable behaviour?), and he famously remarked on the last day of shooting that 'Your life is like Lulu's, and you will end the same way'. That was almost prophetic, and her failure to register (to Pabst) that she was in any way aware of the consequences of her folly, was discreditable. So when I look at a film as good as \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" I am as conscious of her striking ability, as I am appalled by what she threw away through sheer wilful arrogance. \n\nThe story, by Margarete Bohme, caused a great scandal in 1905. It replicated the tale of the baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, who committed suicide in 1927. It was not just the subject (a very candid treatment of prostitution that revealed a sordid and - worse still - undisciplined underbelly to Wilhelmine society), but the outspoken attack on the reformatory system, on the conditional and de haut en bas nature of charitable provision, and the strong suggestion of feminism that was highly offensive in a rigidly paternalistic social system.\n\nAttitudes towards manners and morals changed emphatically with the establishment of the Weimar regime, and Bohme's novel was first filmed in 1919. A decade later, and having established herself as a poster child for sexual liberation, the role of Thymiane Henning seemed ripe for fresh treatment by Brooks.\n\nBrooks performs the role of the wronged daughter who has suffered a 'fate worse than death' at the hands of a repellant apothecary's assistant (an excellent performance by the great Fritz Rasp); brutal treatment at a reformatory (more great stuff from Andrews Engelmann and a sadistic Valeska Gert - a differentiated reprise of the Sapphic character of Countess Geschwitz played by Alice Roberts in \"Pandora's Box\"), to further disappointments in the brothel, etc. The entire ensemble turns out a first class performance, and Pabst and Sepp Allgeier ensure that the photography complements the power of the story.",

                "text": "Leaving Hollywood was a gamble for Louise Brooks, who had by the end of the Twenties reportedly grown restless with the studio system and had traveled to Europe. There she became involved with a trilogy of movies (and director G. W. Pabst on two of them) starting with PANDORA's BOX in Germany and culminating in France with PRIX DE BEAUTE, each considered essentials in her all-too-brief body of work. DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is the second collaboration between Brooks and Pabst and it's hard to point which one of the two is visually stronger. Both contain elements of strong German Expressionism. Although, where the former was drenched in dark images, the latter had a more cerebral darkness closer to the moral fabric of Margarethe Bohme's sordid story.\n\nIt's also hard to say in which one of the two Pabst films Louise Brooks looks better because in both she has extremely modulated performances way ahead of her time, dismissed when they were released, re-discovered over the years. Where in PANDORA'S BOX Brooks had that one remarkable scene where she seduces the doctor who's taken her in as the doctor's son walks in on them, rendering her sensuality to that of a cool, Goth dominatrix thirty years before Bettie Page, in DIARY, as the innocent Thymiane Henning, she's seen as a virginal survivor. Clearly, the camera loves here even more here as her dark looks give way to an ethereal beauty looking for her inner woman while a world filled with dark people threaten to quench her light out.\n\nIt becomes an outrage of almost mythical proportions when Thymiane falls from grace due to actions outside of her control; in searching for the truth as to why a beloved maid has decided to leave the house she falls into the sexual trap of her father's assistant, Meinhert. Nine months later she gives birth to a child, but because she refuses to marry Meinhert she is sent to a reform school where she is stripped of her elegance and forced to become an automaton under the uber-strict, iron hand of both Directors of the reform school. There she also befriends another girl, Erika, with whose help she escapes. Going back home proves fruitless -- she learns her child has died. Having nothing to hold on to, she tracks down her friend Erika who is now working in a brothel for a madam.\n\nIt's here where life warms up to Thymiane as she slowly joins the land of the living. However, an encounter with her family leads to heartbreak when they see what she has become. Even so, she marries into wealth (as her father dies and leaves her nothing and Meinhert tries one last time to trick her into coming back home), and is finally able to help the other girls who still live in oppression at the reform school as she denounces its evils.\n\nDIARY OF A LOST GIRL is all but a dark affair. Despite the lurid elements of the story, it's extremely compassionate as heard by the near-ambient score, and those close ups where Louise Brooks' transcendent face fills the screen and serenely communicates a myriad of emotions at key scenes differentiate it from PANDORA'S BOX, where Brook's Lulu was always seen in shadows and was essentially a fallen woman spiralling down into tragedy. For the time it was considered scandalous and erotic -- if anything, its eroticism is implied more than seen. The scene where Meinhert seduces Thymiane is charged with a huge amount of electricity, as is the scene when the stern headmistress is banging her drum to a beat she only knows as the girls exercise. Hers is an ugly performance, typical of predatory lesbians preying on girls they can't have, and it's one that can't be (unfairly) considered stereotypical.\n\nTime has proved to be kind to the Pabst's masterpiece. Storywise, it's still contemporary in many ways -- it's no different than the story of PALINDROMES in spirit. There are moments of weirdness, such as when Thymiane drinks liquor at the brothel and gets loose as the clients and other prostitutes watch, or the bizarre exchange between Thymiane and her male client. The delicacy in which the darker aspects of the story are handled elevate it from being a merely exploitative film, and there is one haunting moment when a male client tells Thymiane, \"We're all lost.\" It's a tender scene of solidarity within a world that only sees such woman as tainted and men as lecherous. A historic movie that should be discovered by people looking to find the roots of subtle acting and subdued drama.",

                "text": "You must have Pabst in your life at some point. Time it well, seek out a few silents beforehand. It was an exciting era for movies anyway, you're going to have a lot of fun. Context will be valuable. That is because Pabst does not set out to impress on the scope of Lang or Murnau, who impress easily, and you may be fooled that he's pretty ordinary. Not so. I rate him as the top German filmmaker of the time, the man had a truly subtle , humane touch that cut deep.\n\nIt may seem as pretty ordinary, this one. It's melodrama about a hapless young girl who is neglected and abused: unwanted pregnancy, forced marriage, reformatory, prostitution. It is a journey of maturity that takes her through many worlds, most of them depressing. DW Griffith would have done this in somber , sanctimonious tones. Chaplin could do it frivolously, with a bit of kindly fate in the machine of sorrow. Pabst did it another way, and it's his way that most likely has influenced our contemporary understanding of cinematic melodrama as something quite pure and sophisticated.\n\nThat sophistication is seeking ways to deliver both the redemptive story and many ways, different paths to reason and emotion, some of them shrouded in dream, and seems to have carried on from here to Sirk to elsewhere and Lynch.\n\nI want to devote this comment to all these items of, let's say, peripheral narrative vision. You can read up a description of the story in the other comments.\n\nThere's Louise Brooks for one, exquisite beauty even among movie queens of the silent era. But Pabst was sensitive; unlike Sternberg in Blue Angel, he doesn't frame her for sex, trusting the male gaze to work the usual way anyway. Brooks both here and in Pandora's Box is a spirited , swanlike creature.\n\nThere are four worlds that she travels through, possibly more. Each one revealed by the treatment of sex. The first is the parental nest, sex is covert yet (the tryst with the maid) and she is a sheltered child, naive and innocent of finer implications around her. The film begins portentously with a suicide and a man promising truth of the story. In a roundabout way he does, by exploiting sexual vulnerability.\n\nThe second world is at the reformatory: it is a simplistic world with stock villains (matron - guard) where expressions of sexuality are forbidden. Here others administer decisions and she only has to obey the story. It is very much a stepdown into childhood, but in a way that is painfully clear to her (in the parent's nest, she had illusions of freedom). A revolt is staged and she escapes.\n\nWhat she doesn't know, is that she escapes to a high-class brothel. We find out as she does, when an envelope full of money arrives the morning after a night of drinking, merrymaking and sex. But - as sex enters the picture - so this is a world now where people are ambiguous figures, not always villains. Here a creep looking for sex is repudiated, only for the kind protector to assume his place: this man has noble aspirations to save the girls, but he'd much rather have a good time. He's a bit of a hypocrite, but it would be a puritanical stretch to think him bad. Here she learns to endure and persist.\n\nNow for the best part. The narrative is on the top level in the form of excerpts from a diary. But, you will note steadily the introduction of more and more subtle, visual dislocations from the ordinary. \n\nThat male gaze mysteriously lulls her to sleep both times she has sex. Both times it's against her will, both times signify a turn in the gear of the world. The second time is accompanied by the bedroom door inexplicably opening ajar by its own self, and then the lover and a sedated Louise in his arms waltz into frame. It's a heady , seductive shot.\n\nIt's obvious what Pabst is getting at - she succumbs to the role expected of her - but in doing so, succeeds in demanding from us a different set of reasoning tools for the rest of the film. There are several more shots of her asleep in the hands of men, as though dreaming her whole ordeal. Dance is a main thread, and wrapped around the recurring notion of deciding the depth of your performance.\n\nThat different set of tools is, at the same time as the world around her changes, and demands each time a different response, getting to note semiconscious spillovers inside of her.\n\nThis aspect of the work is amazing. Look how, in both the reformatory and brothel, she is part of a chorus of girls, usually framed with two or more girls hovering beside her, and it's that chorus instead of just herself that is experiencing the story, as though part of that fragile self has splintered by the trauma, and each splintered self has taken mirrored shape around her to shoulder part of the pain. (compare to the brothel scenes from Inland Empire)\n\nThe fourth world is having learned to cope, and that allows her to return to the early stages of the story, starting with another scene of dance and frolicking by the beach, and eventually save one of those splintered selves from the same fate.\n\nSomething to meditate upon.",

                "text": "The second G. W. Pabst/Louise Brooks collaboration comes close to equaling its predecessor in terms of depicting a world in moral decay through the plight of a fallen woman. Brooks' acting is slightly weaker at the beginning of the film, where she struggles to portray her character as a naive youngster. She becomes far more convincing as the film progresses and her character grows.\n\nAs with Pandora's Box, there is a somewhat lurid atmosphere to this film, with each major character acting in their own, sometimes depraved, self-interest. For instance, one of the overseers at the reformatory confiscates a girl's lipstick, only to apply it to his own lips when he is back in his office. As with Pandora's Box, it is tempting to read this as symbolic of the decadent moral climate of Weimar Berlin. The general theme of rising and falling fortunes, sometimes due to one's own actions and sometimes due to events beyond one's control must have spoken to Depression-era audiences, though.\n\nThe diary features prominently as a device early in the film but is forgotten towards the end. Perhaps, as Brooks' character has grown, she no longer feels she needs it but this is not depicted clearly. Rather, it seems to have simply been forgotten.\n\nThe Kino edition of this film has a beautiful, very moving score that fits the scenes incredibly well. In fact, it is the best I have heard for any silent film.\n\nUltimately, this film is on a par with Pandora's Box. Both are well-executed melodramas that reflect the seediness and decadence of the era and Brooks' acting is refreshingly modern in each.",

                "text": "I love this film because the authenticity of emotion comes through virtually all the characters. I first saw it on the big screen when I was 22, about the same age that Louise Brooks was when she starred in the film. There was something so simple about it that really reached the emotional core of the story--the loss of the relationship between a father and daughter. I easily identified with the daughter character--and who wouldn't want to identify with the most beautiful woman you'd ever seen (I still think that). The injustice she endured changed her from a vulnerable happy-go-lucky girl into a hardhearted survivor. My life followed a similar course and at the time I first saw it, I was a heavy drinker and drug user, plus it was the beginning of the end of my relationship with my dad. If you have father-child issues this movie may be as cathartic for you as it was for me. One caveat when watching silent films--you have to remember how long ago they were made; they may seem laughable because they're so different, and some of the acting is exaggerated because not long before film began, all acting was done on the stage and had to be \"read\" at the back of the house. I admit there are some corny overtones, but on the whole it's a great work of art and gorgeous to look at--just like Louise.",

                "text": "While it was common during the silent era for Europeans like Greta Garbo and Rudolph Valentino to cross the Atlantic and make it big in America, Louise Brooks, as was her nature, went against the grain and headed in the opposite direction, where she made it big in three European films, two directed by G. W. Pabst. Of the two, \"Pandora's Box\" is the better film, but \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" is the film that made me fall in love with the girl in the black helmet.\n\n\"Diary\" doesn't have the sure hand of Pabst's direction in \"Pandora,\" but it does have a story and characters that are more easily accessible. And though I feel \"Pandora\" is one of the greatest films ever made, it took me a few viewings to recognize the scope of its originality. And Brooks' character Lulu, though fascinating and exquisitely performed, is somewhat impenetrable.\n\nThymian, the character Brooks plays in \"Diary,\" is an innocent caught up in circumstance and the social mores of her time. The very nature of her character makes us care what happens to her. Without resorting to cloying sentimentality, Pabst manages to create a character in Thymian that gets under our skin emotionally, even when she succumbs to manipulation by others. (Big spoilers in next sentence, so skip to next paragraph if you haven't seen the film): After being raped, giving birth to an illegitimate child and sent away by her family to an institution for delinquent girls, then losing her baby and becoming a prostitute, Pabst keeps us rooting for her to succeed in life, however she chooses.\n\nPabst's effectiveness is due in no small part to Brooks' performance. Her detractors have suggested that she wasn't much of an actress, just a pretty face playing herself. Yet, all anyone has to do is see the two Pabst films back to back to realize what different characters Brooks created from two, in many ways, similar roles. I do not see an ounce of Lulu in Thymian. If Brooks was channeling just herself, she had some far ranging personality facets to select from. But whatever she was doing, I'm just very glad it was captured on film.\n\nI prefer not to say much about the plot of this film, because there are some nice surprises throughout and though I've checked the spoiler box for this comment because of the brief description of what happens to Thymian, I don't want to spoil the film's wonderful twists and turns for those who happen to read this.\n\nTechnically, the film is beautifully shot, and although it doesn't possess the dark atmosphere of \"Pandora,\" it does have it's own distinctive look via locale, set design and some spectacular camera moves, particularly a wonderful shot that follows Thymian up a stairway. The secondary characters, particularly in the girls institution, are far more caricatured than need be, and the humor is overdone in spots, but none of that detracts from the unusually forward story being told. Like \"Pandora,\" the film is ahead of its time. And although Pabst did not shoot the ending he wanted, I find the ending used one of the most satisfying things about the film.\n\nSee this film and fall head over heels for the girl in the black helmet.",

Received by the press in 1905, is the most famous and best-selling book of women. By the end of the twentieth of its sales has exceeded more than a million copies, making the novel one of the top bestsellers of its time. One modern scholar has called \"Diary of the Fallen\" \"Perhaps the most notorious and, of course, commercially the most successful autobiographical story of the early twentieth century.\n\nLiterary sensation. According to the author tells the true story of a young woman forced into prostitution circumstances. At the time of publication, believed to be an authentic book is a diary, but argued only Bome that was its editor. Likewise there has been the emergence of the myth of some novel effects on social reform at the time.\n\nThe first screening took place in 1918, director Richard Oswald \u00abDas Tagebuch Einer Verlorenen\u00bb. To date, the film is considered \"lost\" and no one in the audience has no opportunity to see it.\n\nThe second film adaptation was the work of the so-called \"historic duet\" Georg Wilhelm Pabst filmmaker and an American actress Louise Brooks. According to rumors, he asked her did not even know, seeing only her picture with a charming and powerful features, a mysterious look. That same year she appeared before him in a few ambiguous psychological drama \"Pandora's Box.\" Both films are emblematic of the German cinema of the late twenties and this despite the fact that the young Brooks at home in the states acted in film punchings, second-rate bands, however, after the Commonwealth with Pabst has signed a lucrative contract with film company \u00abParamount\u00bb.\n\nTheir duet was a success for both of them. Brooks joined the amazing image of her heroine, expressing regret and despair with a rare subtlety of nature, while Pabst reel filled with memorable, vibrant and accentuate the culmination of events moments, particularly a scene in a brothel, where circling in the dance of prostitutes and their clients share a daughter and a fallen selfish father in a sudden encounter. The story itself, as the film is filled with meaningful scenes. In the episode where the assistant girl's father clings to Meyner Thyme, after which the heroine of Louise Brooks, faints and he was a \"dirty\" smile carries her into his bedroom, symbolizes the suppression of pure kindness naive girl in front of vicious evil bastard lust. Georg Wilhelm Pabst film can also be partly compared with the early work of director Charles Chaplin. One of the scenes of the film in the penitentiary, which enters the main character, is very ironic and ambiguous context. Girls taking place in this institution re-education, and in fact every day tolerate violent attitude on the part of both the moral and ugly teachers, arrange one evening in a dormitory rebellion, lashing out at their supervisors throughout the crowd with his fists. Similar scenes are in movies of Chaplin, it is in his films where he played the director, when he kicked his foot heroes stupid and evil members of the order, thus showing their relationship to government authorities at the time as a whole, whose policies have complicated the lives of many people.\n\n\"Diary of the Fallen\" - a psychological drama with realistic events, which is a blow to the selfish bourgeois society in the face of vicious character depicted in the film. The story of the preservation of resilience, kindness, courage, compassion, and love the girl, despite all the troubles through which she had to go through.",

                "text": "I really loved this film despite the terrible score that came with the Kino DVD. I never had a problem with any Kino films and the music scores because they were all quite good, but the one for Tagebuch einer Verlorenen didn't even fit the film. I thought that the music was too overwhelming and was depressing even during the \"happy\" scenes. The film was beautifully filmed and Pabst did a wonderful job directing it. I loved the staircase scene when the camera follows Louise Brooks' movements. I was reading an article in Lulu in Hollywood and Brooks actually mentions Pabst being excited about finding out a way to make the camera turn for the staircase scene. If I didn't watch the film before reading that, I would have not known which film or scene Brooks was referencing.\n\nMy favourite scene, outside of the staircase scene due to the fabulous way it was filmed, has got to be when the girls are exercising and the director's wife (Gert) orgasms as she hits the gong. The way the scene is filmed by cutting to the girls exercising, the hitting of the gong getting faster and faster, to Gert's face as she climaxes is incredibly well done. Gert's face expression says it all: her sadistic nature comes out and so does her sexual self despite her plain non-made up face and her nun-like clothes. The scene also reminded me of Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Olympia and what Susan Sontag calls \"fascist aesthetics\". The lines that I thought of when I saw this scene was \"a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude\" and \"the masses are made to take form, be design\" (Sontag, \"Fascist Aesthetics). Then I remembered another line from \"Fascist Aesthetics\": \"The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force.\" As you can see, I read this essay maybe one too many times. Anyway, the girls in the film were like the masses, all doing the same movements, and Gert's character was like the dictatorial figure who had full control over the girls. They followed her orders almost mechanically, without thought. I wonder what Kracauer said about this film; I think this film would fit his teleological argument (and flawed in my opinion) perfectly.\n\nAlong with Die Buchse der Pandora, this film succeeds in weeding out the melodrama and really hits the nail on the effects of societal norms on people. The realism of the film really hit me when I saw that Meinert (Rasp) is not punished at all but the innocent Thymiane is. It's true that there isn't always a happy ending and sometimes, bad people don't suffer. What made me a bit annoyed with Thymiane is that she gave away her inheritance rather than giving it to the people who have helped her survive, such as Erika (Meinhard) and the other hostesses/prostitutes and the madame. It made me upset that she completely forgot about the people who she was with. Thymiane writes that she wants to forget the past, but the people she was with were incredibly supportive and friendly. None of them forced her into prostitution and even protected her when a man almost raped her. In the end, she does help Erika, which I guess does redeem her previous actions, but it was frustrating nonetheless. And Meta (Kinz) was the biggest bitch EVER. Even when she receives all the money that Thymiane has, she doesn't even say a word of thanks. She is reluctant to let her child even go to Thymiane and although her letting her child go to Thymiane can be a sign of compromise, it just wasn't enough. \n\nI'm pretty sure Pabst has meant this film to be a social critique, but I wonder if the scenes I considered to be criticisms were meant to be criticisms. I saw this film as a critique towards high society and how they shun the women for being \"deviant\" yet the men never suffer the consequences. Also, high society families are portrayed in a negative light with the philandering father and a family willing to cut off connections with their daughter. It is the prostitutes and lower class people who are genuinely caring and friendly. The hypocrisy of the self-righteous people are emphasized in this film, but maybe this wasn't what the film was about? I hope I'm not too off the base with Pabst's vision and the story.\n\nFilm blog: http://sachlichkeit.net",

Brooks stars as a young innocent thing who's life goes a bad direction when she's introduced to every vice the world has to offer. Name a vice and it's in here: sex, booze, dance, gambling. It's like a public service message as broadcast by the Christian Coalition. It's a cautionary tale about the evils awaiting innocent souls, and it's pretty hard to take by the time the film has neared the two-hour mark. However, it's redeemed by a finale in which Brooks decides to devote her energies to helping other \"lost\" girls by truly understanding their plight, rather than cow them with moral fire and brimstone.\n\nBrooks is beautiful, but she's not much of an actress, at least not as evidenced by this film. Her Thymian (what a name!) is a blank slate, and Brooks's reaction shots more often than not catch her staring at the camera with little or no expression on her face. Thymian is a girl who just lets things happen to her, so it's hard to muster up the requisite sympathy to really care about her plight. What's more interesting is the peripheral action always going on around her. The middle section of the film, which takes place in a home for wayward girls, captures some of the most entertainingly bizarre moments I've seen in a movie for a long time. The home is run by a butch dominatrix who leers lecherously at the girls while they eat soup and works herself into what appears to be a sexual frenzy when she forces them to perform nightly calisthenics (which consist of the girls flopping over at the waist and then standing up again quickly, over and over, like fish gasping for oxygen). There's also a looming tall bald man who looks like he could have auditioned for the role of Lurch, who we see playing the piano one minute and gripping young girls by the backs of their necks the next. The best scene in the film comes when the girls turn on these two and begin pounding on them to the beat of a drum, making one wonder why the girls didn't do this much sooner, since there are about twenty of them and only two of the caretakers.\n\nPeople not familiar with pre-Code cinema (and European pre-Code cinema to boot) may be surprised at the adult subject matter in this film: nudie postcards, lesbian overtones, pre-marital sex, even a shot of a pregnant woman (gasp!). It's always a reminder of just how straight-laced movies became in the years shortly following the advent of sound.\n\n\"Diary of a Lost Girl\" is longer than it needs to be and doesn't exactly take the subtlest approach in its storytelling, but then what silent film ever did? If you like silent films you will probably at least enjoy this one. If nothing else, it provides a nice introduction to Louise Brooks and the on-screen charisma that made her a star.\n\nGrade: B",

                "text": "\"Tagebuch einer Verlorenen\" or \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" is a German movie from 1929 and this is still a time when silent black-and-white films like this one dominated the industry, even if it was not a long way to go anymore until the sound era thrived. The director here is Georg Wilhelm Pabst, one of the most respected movie makers from that era and the title character is played by his muse, lead actress Louise Brooks, once again. The writer is Rudolf Leonhardt and it is probably his most known work. Here he adapted a novel by writer Margarethe B\u00f6hme for the big screen, even if it was not the first time this novel was adapted. The version from 10 years earlier, however, is entirely forgotten today compared to Pabst's more recent work from four years before Nazis came into power. My opinion here is that the film stands and falls with how much you can identify and care for the main character. And sadly I must say that I almost did not care for her at all, during the entire film. I am not sure if the reason is the script or Brooks' performance, maybe a mix of both. She is a prime example of an actress who was a huge star during the silent era, but did not manage the transition into sound films. Then again, looking at how I perceived her here, I cannot say this is much of a loss, at least for me. Finally, a word about the film poster: I guess this must have been almost scandalous back then, a naked (implied!) woman inside a book. I doubt this could have been made 10 years later. But it did not have to. I do not recommend the watch.It dragged a lot for me and I do not recommend the watch.",

                "text": "It isn't difficult to see why Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Diary of a Lost Girl caused a bit of a headache for the censors back in 1929. Even for a movie made during the Weimar Republic era, a revolutionary time for cinema when directors were consistently pushing the boundaries with controversial tales of debauchery and Germany's seedy underbelly, the themes and social insight feel unnervingly modern. Teaming up once again with his muse Louise Brooks, the Kansas-born starlet plays Thymian, the naive daughter of a wealthy pharmacist who, in the opening scene, watches their maid leave the family home in shame when Thymian's father (Josef Rovensky) gets her pregnant.\n\nAlthough it's clear to the audience, Thymian is puzzled as to why the girl has left. Her father's assistant, the creepy and much older Meinert (Fritz Rasp), invites her to the pharmacy that night on the promise to tell her everything, but instead takes advantage of the young girl and gets her pregnant. When the baby arrives, Thymian refuses to reveal who the father is but her family learn the truth from her diary, and insist that the two marry to avoid damage to the family's reputation. When she refuses, Thymian's baby is taken from her and she is packed off to a reformatory watched over by the intimidating director (Andrews Engelmann) and his tyrannical wife (Valeska Gert). After rebelling against the school, Thymian and a friend escape and join a brothel,\n\nLike many films made during the Weimar era, Diary of a Lost Girl depicts the decay in almost every aspect of German society at the time. The lives of the rich are stripped bare, and their motivations are heavily questioned when the family send Thymian away not with her 'rehabilitation' in mind, but simply to save face. The reformatory itself is a cold and bleak place, where the director's wife bangs a rhythm for the inhabitants to rigidly eat their soup too. They are less concerned with helping the girls fit back into the society that has failed them, and more about satisfying their own sadistic desires. In one particularly effective close-up, the wife seems to be achieving some sort of sexual gratification from her monstrous behaviour.\n\nThe one place Thymian feels accepted on any sort of level is the brothel, a place where she can be herself without any kind of judgement or fear of social exile. While Thymian can at times be frustratingly naive and swoonish whenever she finds herself in the arms of a man, Louise Brooks delivers a tour de force performance that helps the audience maintain sympathy for her put-upon character, even when the film is at its most melodramatic. Even though the film is now 87 years old, Brooks's acting feels completely modern. Where most silent actors switch between rigid and operatic in their performances, Brooks is naturalistic and subtle, making it clear just why Pabst was so eager to work with her again after Pandora's Box, made the same year.",

Henning owns the pharmacy, and later on we learn that he actually inherited it from his late wife (you have to be able to read the summons to the reading of the will to know that; and that's why Thymian gets a share of it when he dies.) Meinert is essentially an apprentice of some sort, who is hoping to usurp the whole business for himself when Henning dies. That's why he seduces Thymian (perhaps has some idea of marrying the boss' daughter at the start of the film, his French postcards aside...), and then sucks up to Meta when she marries Henning.",

This is much more a straightforward human narrative than an attempt at representing archetype, and there is also less presumption that we are already familiar with the subject matter: it does not require so much intense concentration just to keep up. In addition, there are a greater number of sympathetic characters -- which is to say that there are some! \n\nHowever, the notorious Louise Brooks still did not come across to me as being a good actress. In fact, if anything I felt that her performance here was more stilted than in \"Pandora's Box\", where from time to time I was actually impressed. She is far too obviously sophisticated for the early scenes of a teenage Thymian -- Brooks is no Mary Pickford -- and although she is more convincing as a workhouse rebel, I found myself frequently feeling that the actress was simply a beat behind the action; standing there waiting for an off-screen voice to tell her how to move or react, rather than inhabiting the character within the world of the film. Contemporary critics called her acting for Pabst \"wooden\", and to this viewer all too often she comes across as a beautiful waxen doll, expressing at best one emotion per scene -- these pictures do not represent her best work.\n\nNonetheless as a whole the film held my interest and was entertaining. (It was frightfully convenient the way that Thymian would faint whenever she was on the point of sexual congress, however... thus enabling her to be presented as the most innocent of 'fallen women'!) Perhaps the most effective are the rigidly synchronised and choreographed scenes in the workhouse -- to an English audience inevitably reminiscent of \"Oliver Twist\" -- followed by the girls' final rebellion, which was the first point at which the picture really began to engage me emotionally. (I was somewhat disappointed to discover at the end of the film that the rebellion had apparently had no long-lasting effect; even the same superintendent was still in charge.) I actually cared about what happened to Thymian and her circle, which made a pleasant change.\n\nThat final title, though..! I can only assume it's not quite so thumpingly preachy and obvious in the original German; it completely broke up the mood of the scene for me, and thus detracted from the whole end of the film. Someone clearly didn't have faith in the actors' presentation, and felt the need to drive the moral home with a sledge-hammer.",

But when Thymian is seduced or, more likely, raped by a local pharmacist, and gets pregnant, the baby is snatched from her and she's sent to a home for wayward girls, where -- you guessed it -- the headmaster (a leering Andrews Engelsmann) is more depraved than the wards.\n\nThymian tries to save herself but is dragged further down when economics force her into prostitution.

Throughout the film the dominance and hypocrisy of the male culture was highlighted, but prior to the conclusion Thymaine was able to shame the people that had once shamed her, which provided the film with themes of anti-authoritarianism and hope. The cinematography was arguably more evolved than in other films directed by Pabst, and the acting was second to none. The camerawork consisted of mainly mid-shots and medium close-ups, which placed emphasis on the characters and recorded their interaction with each other.

The draconian actions of the reformatory cause her to run away with a young Count, but unfortunately he is penniless and they have nowhere to go, so she gets stuck in a brothel of sorts where she lives until circumstances bring her back to her family and eventually lead her to a new life and new identity, from which she learns compassion for the other \"lost girls\" of the world.\n\nTechnically, that's what it's about.\n\nAt least, that's what happens. The problem with this film is that Thymian is the only character with any motivation, and it's a slight and unfocused one at that. For the first half of the film, indeed, one at least can be forgiving to the film because the characters inherent (and physical) beauty at least provides some sort of motion to the storyline. Unfortunately, since the characters have no motivation, and since the director seems entirely unwilling to let anything tragic have its due in the world, the movie skips past what could possibly be a beautiful and tragic ending and continues for another hour or so on tangents without importance or design.\n\nAt first this discursiveness seems rather stunning and unexpected, but a quick look back over a few points of the first half of the film start revealing that indeed, it seems Pabst really didn't have a clear understanding of overaching tones, themes, motifs. He has a storyline and names for characters, but no personalities or plot. For instance, the name of this movie: DIARY of a Lost Girl. The beginning is quite clear and obvious the importance of the diary to the character of Thymian, but not only does it not sustain its direct duty to bring her some form of closure, revelation, or salvation, it also simply disappears after a certain point and is never heard of again.\n\nFurthermore, the movie strives to close up all threads with an opportunistic idea that everything can work out, but it closes up threads that needn't be included or are even merely incidental in the story arch. I repeat: the characters lack motivation. Since the characters lack motivation, what are they supposed to do to win, or lose, or react to events? They have nowhere to go or expand, and thus the ending keeps getting further and further away.\n\nMost distressing about watching this film is it's complete lack of understanding about tone. It goes to extremes that seem at first to show the incredible level of conformity, decadence, ignorance, or whatever, but eventually go to far and fail to make an organized statement. Little nods to lesbianism are included for no real reason whatsoever. And what about Thymian's tendency to pass out before being taken advantage of? If it's meant to show her lack of control over the situation, it's a very maudlin and over-indulgent attempt.\n\nIn fact, why does Thymian want to hide the identity of the father of her baby when she was quite clearly raped? Some rape victims tend to victimize themselves by claiming that they deserved it, but there's no hint, nod, or involvement of that dysfunction. Why does the mistress of the reformatory derive such pleasure at the exercise of the girls? There's no clear evidence to support that she's sadistic, lesbian, or any has any form of motivation besides the fact that showing her wild grinning face seems a good way to get a reaction from the audience. Why is the housekeeper turned stepmother so stern, and furthermore, why can't she seem to make any face other than her one stern one? Sometimes this film goes to lengths, also, to go further into depth about things that don't deserve such treatment. Most of the ending seems to be an attempt by the filmmakers to take control of the theme (which they don't have) by reintroducing arbitrary characters and involving them in entirely new plot lines that don't have any coherent or enthused meaning on the overall storyarch. Basically, as soon as the Count's son inexplicably kills himself, the movie becomes saturated with false pretensions towards positivity, endurance, and \"love\" without taking the time to admit that the entire movie has already ended.\n\nFrom there, the whole thing begins to fall entirely out of control and gets worse and worse until roughly about the beach scene and beyond, which if by that point you're still paying attention and caring about where the characters are going, you're just going to be lead to one of the most antithetical climaxes in film history. Yes, the Count actually said that line, and yes, that's all you're left with.\n\n--PolarisDiB",

Perhaps it has to do with the small number of films she made or her persona off screen.\n\nOn to the movie itself. This is a very adult movie for its time because much of the movie concerns sex and illegitimacy. Louise is the daughter of a very weak, hypocritical and immoral man who makes a habit of impregnating his maids (this is highly reminiscent of DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID). However, when Louise becomes pregnant, he throws her out of the house! Leonard Maltin indicated in one of his reviews that Louise's character had gotten pregnant after she was raped. I couldn't see that this was necessarily the case--she appeared to have been seduced by her father's assistant, not raped. Actually, had she been clearly raped in the film, I think this would have greatly improved the movie's impact and created a wonderful parallel with her father's sex life.\n\nAfter she gives birth, Louise is sent to a home for \"fallen women\" and her baby is taken from her.

It's fun to watch devout Jew Robinson and lovely Mexican Lupe Velez play orientals (it was o.k. to use that term back then; don't understand why it no longer is....). This is possibly the second of Robinson's Asian portrayals; \"possibly\" as Robinson's Cobra Collins in OUTSIDE THE LAW is of somewhat ambiguous ethnicity although his mother in that film is clearly of Asian extraction. Seeing Robinson in virtually any film in which he appeared prior to LITTLE CAESAR is both fascinating and of cinematic historical significance. EAST IS WEST is no exception. Don't let your viewing and possible enjoyment of the film be marred by revisionist thinking i.e. it being racially stereotypical and thus now more than 80 years later we should deem it offensive etc. It was a different if not necessarily a better time. Just accept this film at face value as well as in its proper historical and chronological contexts and you might have some fun with it. It's clear to see Robinson was enjoying it all; much more so than he did the somber hatchet man he played 2 years later in a film of the same title. Hope you can find a decent, watchable copy as did I.",

A lot of Hollywood actors played all- purpose foreigners.

            "It's autumn and the squirrels are busy collecting nuts for the winter. One squirrel is determined to shake the last nut from an otherwise barren tree. When he finally does so, it proves not to be a nut at all, but a caterpillar that was trying to become a butterfly. The squirrels are collecting corn cobs too, but a crafty crow is not above stealing them out of the squirrels' tree. The crow brings them back to his fellows, where they store them in a scarecrow's long underwear. A skunk is having bad luck trying to shove an oversized pumpkin through an undersized tree hole and succeeds only in smashing it to bits. A porcupine has a clever way to collect apples: on his quills. The beavers bark and dance happily as they build their dam. The ducks quack merrily as they eat worms. Then winter approaches and all the animals must find shelter. Some will find it easier than others."

True, the short doesn't really have a plot, but with everything else so good, one is obliged to overlook. The Silly Symphony is one of four shorts that pay tribute to the Four Seasons in the Silly Symphony franchise. All of them are very funny and charming in their own way, and this is evidence of that.

Also more posterior gags, in dubious taste, from the Disney animators.\n\nThe SILLY SYMPHONIES, which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929, are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation. Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount, with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music. There was little plot in the early Symphonies, which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals, all moving frantically to the soundtrack. Gradually, however, the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot, characterization & photographic special effects. The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale, Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed. It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring. In 1939, with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon, Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES; they had run their course & served their purpose.",

It's quite plain and boring, just various poorly-designed animals gathering food for their winter hibernation to a jaunty theme, but I personally didn't find much charm to be had in their frolicking. The animation really isn't very good, all of the horrid backgrounds are practically bare, and the violin-heavy music is warbly and out of tune, it's overall bland and not very fun, nothing about it stands out to me. It's forgivable though because they were basically just starting out with the very art of animation and there were to be many twists and turns... So I just class these poorer early Symphonies as clumsy first steps. A few of the smaller details are nice, like the leaves flying everywhere and the reflections of the ducks on the water, and I did like how it was actually set during Autumn, which arguably is something that couldn't be said for the Summer and Springtime shorts! I also liked when it started to snow and the ducks flew away because it at least changed up the dull tempo for a moment. There's nothing substantial in this short though, it's pretty lacking in my opinion, no gem and no favourite of mine. A most unlucky seven...",

Animals preparing for the coming winter describes the plot in a nutshell, so to speak.\n\nThere's a fair amount of dancing being done by various critters as they prepare for the coming change in season. Given that the animation is essentially set to music, this is to be expected. Among the more interesting bits of business here are squirrels harvesting corn, using rather inventive storage methods, only to have a couple of crows take some of their corn. There's also a couple of scenes with ducks feeding and later flying off after the onset of a storm.\n\nIt's no Flowers and Trees, but the lessons the animators learned on earlier shorts such as this one made Flowers and Trees and other, later, shorts possible. The Mouse wasn't built in a day.\n\nThis short is available on the Disney Treasures More Silly Symphonies DVD set and this and the set are well worth finding. Recommended.",
