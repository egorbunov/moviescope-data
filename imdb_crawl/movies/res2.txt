Meanwhile Robert Ellis and henchman Ward Bond are buying horses with fake government warrants and convincing the folks of Virginia City it's Indian by taking out stage coaches, filling them with arrows and scalping the occasional victim -- the last is Bond's idea.\n\nOld hand Lambert Hillyer directs well from a good script and budget (he had got his start with William Hart and so knew how a Western should go) and L. William O'Connell's camera work is quite lovely -- the copy I watched today on GetTV was a fine, clear print. It's not a deep movie, but for an hour's light entertainment, it's certainly enjoyable."

Kay appears (not too convincingly at first, but she gets much better as the movie goes along) as a young, naive English girl who becomes impregnated by a titled gentleman (Patrick Knowles). He, being the callow character he is, already has an invalid wife (beautifully played by Freida Inescourt) who cannot bear a child. Kay allows his aristocratic family \"adopt\" her baby and she runs off to America to forget. Being a classic weeper, she of course does not forget, even though she is married to George Brent (who really is pretty good here). Eventually, a faithful friend (Roland Young who enlivens the proceedings with needed humor) conspire to bring closure to her heartache by bring the real mother and \"adopted mother\" together for a tearful, yet satisfying, ending. \n\nIt plays a lot better on film than it does in print and I'm sure I am not doing it justice. All I know is that it is joyously irresistible and very moving. Kay Francis received a lot of mixed reviews for her performance at that time, but I think that she is splendid- truly an underrated actress from that period and worthy of watching!"

                "text": "I really loved George Brent and Kay Francis together, and I only wish they'd done more films as a team. This particular plot has had variations of it done time and again, but the difference in a mediocre film and a good one can often be the performances, as is the case here.\n\nKay plays Belinda Warren, a woman who is in love with a man (Patric Knowles) who is married to an invalid (Frieda Inescort). We only hear things from Belinda's point of view - she says she's in love, so we really have no idea what is going on in the mind of the young man. When Belinda finds that she is pregnant, she confides in her close friend \"Tubbs\" (Roland Young). He in turn talks to the young man's father, the kindly Lord Farrington (Henry Stephenson), who convinces Belinda that allowing his son and daughter to adopt her child is the best solution for all parties concerned.\n\nMost of the story concerns Belinda after she gives the baby up and after she marries wealthy Jim Baker (George Brent) - we're not shown the courtship. Jim tries to be kind and cheery with Belinda, but this just seems to put her in an even more foul mood than normal, and she is already in a constant state of anxiety. She finds it hard to give her heart to Jim completely when she is simultaneously trying to block out thoughts of her son far away. It looks like the Baker marriage is headed for the rocks when Tubbs shows up out of nowhere and comes up with a plan to put things right.\n\nI know this all sounds very conventional, but believe me it really sparkles on screen with more reality in attitudes than would be normal for a film made in 1936. There's also a cute little sideplot involving a romance that develops between Tubbs and Belinda's doctor. This and the pace work together to give this film heart without weighing it down with drippy melodrama.\n\nRecommended as not the best thing Kay Francis ever did, but certainly worth watching if you get the chance."

                "text": "Up until the tougher Production Code was enacted in 1934, topics such as adultery and premarital sex were relatively common. However, with the Code, these topics and many more were mostly forbidden--or at least highly sanitized and with a moralistic slant. So, while bad girls can and do put out without suffering any negative effects in films like RED HEADED WOMAN (1932), after 1934 this could no longer be the case.\n\nThe theme of GIVE ME YOUR HEART is adultery and premarital sex. Kay Francis plays a woman who has no idea her lover (Patric Knowles) is married. She discovers he has a sickly wife only after becoming pregnant with his baby. But, because she's basically a decent person, she agrees to give up the child to the boyfriend and his wife! Unfortunately, though Francis later meets a wonderful man (George Brent), she is so plagued by guilt and curiosity about the child that her own marriage suffers. How this all works out is something to see for yourself.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this film was that it showed that despite making a mistake, there is still good that can come out of it. Additionally, the film still deals with a rather adult moral dilemma--despite the language of the film being quite careful to get by the censors but tell the story--a tough balancing act indeed. And, most importantly, it doesn't come off as preachy or fake. Another nice touch was the nice acting. Francis is at her best and Henry Stephenson is given a better and richer role than usual for this supporting actor.\n\nOverall, so well made that a tough to believe story idea seems to be believable. An interesting soap that is worth seeing."

Francis' little secret adversely affects her relationship with Mr. Brent. Two years later, Francis' globe-trotting friend Roland Young (as Edward \"Tubbs\" Barron) arranges for Francis and her husband to meet former lover Patric Knowles (as Robert \"Bob\" Melford), his wife Frieda Inescort (as Rosamond Melford), and their collective son... \n\nThough faltering as Florence Nightingale in \"The White Angel\" (1936), Francis reasserts some box office appeal by treading more familiar waters; she attained a respectable #15 position for the year 1936, in the annual exhibitors' poll conducted for \"Boxoffice\" magazine... \n\nTailor-made for Francis, this short-lived Broadway production (by Jay Mallory) revisits a tried and true story. The subjects are treated with more respect than was prevalent at the time, although it's not ground-breaking. Best of the episodic scenes is the confrontation between husbands and wives. The short, less starry performances of Mr. Knowles and Ms. Inescort are especially effective. The subplot involving Mr. Hobbes' interest in alcohol and doctor Helen Flint (as Florence \"Bones\" Cudahy) is strange and unsatisfying. Veteran actors like Henry Stephenson add credence. \n\n***** Give Me Your Heart (9/17/36) Archie Mayo ~ Kay Francis, George Brent, Roland Young, Patric Knowles"

Eleanor Boardman is his faithful wife. Conrad Nagel is friend. Renee Adoree is a fiery Gypsy. Mack Swain plays a Russian judge and Sidney Bracey a philosophic waiter.\n\nIt seems badly edited and/or directed but the story is so dark and gloomy it hardly matters. The 4 stars are all pretty good in this early talkie, and Gilbert, in fine voice, has a few very good scenes that almost salvage the film.\n\nAgain it's odd that contemporary reviews of this film and HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT never mentioned Gilbert as having a bad voice, thin, effeminate, high, or anything else.... The films were just clunkers....."

                "text": "An irresponsible gambler, having destroyed the happiness of those dearest to him, seeks REDEMPTION in suicide.\n\nAccording to cinematic legend, all the talkie MGM films starring John Gilbert were dreadful - the result of a bitter hatred between Gilbert (the highest paid star in Hollywood, with a $1.5 million contract) & studio boss Louis B. Mayer. A determination on Gilbert's part to fulfill the contract, and a campaign instituted by Mayer to destroy Gilbert's career including spreading the rumor that Gilbert's voice was 'high & feminine', culminated in several unwatchable movies.\n\nNot entirely true. The Studio had a huge financial investment in Jack Gilbert and was not going to completely cut its own throat by showcasing him in nothing but dreck. However, of the 8 MGM talkies in which he appeared as solo star (1929 - HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT; 1930 - REDEMPTION; WAY FOR A SAILOR; 1931 - GENTLEMAN'S FATE; THE PHANTOM OF Paris; WEST OF Broadway; 1932 - DOWNSTAIRS; 1933 - FAST WORKERS) most were certainly rather ghastly.\n\nAlthough released after HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT, REDEMPTION was Gilbert's first foray into talking pictures. He hated the film and begged the Studio not to release it, fearful of what it might do to his career. But release it they did, and coming after the atrocious reception of HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT, Gilbert's career was struck a mortal blow.\n\nOne of the main problems with REDEMPTION, aside from the turgid dialogue and dreadful editing, is that it is a depressing story, with wretchedly unhappy characters. This may have worked fine in Tolstoy's original novel (The Living Corpse), but for the cinema, especially dealing with the new difficulties engendered by sound, a morbid story line was deadly. To make matters worse, Gilbert tended to deliver his lines in a sing-song manner, which made them sound silly. Only in the Easter Monday Night scene does he get a few moments to show what he was capable of artistically.\n\nThe rest of the cast, Conrad Nagel, Eleanor Boardman & Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e, are also defeated by the film, although they speak their lines more naturalistically than Gilbert. The existing print of the film seems about 10 minutes short and what appears to be missing, based on Gilbert's final lines, would be the death of Ador\u00e9e's character. (Movie mavens will recognize, in an uncredited role, silent comic Mack Swain playing an unfriendly Russian judge.)\n\nFinally, about The Voice. There was nothing at all strange or unnaturally high about Gilbert's voice. As a matter of fact, it was of medium range & rather cultured & refined. Which was the crux of the problem, of course. While it is possible that no voice could have ever matched the perfect one viewers heard in their minds while watching his strong, virile silent roles, the reality was very different from what they wanted to hear (imagine Robert Montgomery's voice coming out of Clark Gable's mouth.) Gilbert was doomed from his first scene in his debut talkie; his war with Mayer only intensified the agony. John Gilbert would die in 1936, forgotten by most of his former fans, at the age of only 36."

This early \"talkie\" was planned as Gilbert's first feature in the popular new medium; he reportedly detested the film, and release was delayed until after \"His Glorious Night\" (1929). \"Redemption\" looks like they could not get it right. This resulted in a second blow to Gilbert's film career.\n\n*** Redemption (4/5/30) Fred Niblo ~ John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, Renee Adoree, Conrad Nagel"

Much of this can be attributed to his moving to MGM--who had absolutely no idea how to handle the comic. Instead of relying on his physicality and natural talents, they shoved him into bizarre plots--teamed with the VERY overbearing Jimmy Durante--the absolute worst pairing in film history. Fortunately, in the mid-1930s Keaton signed up to make shorts for the tiny studio Educational Pictures. While these films aren't even close to the quality of the old films, they were a heck of a lot better than most of his MGM flicks.\n\nUnfortunately, among the Educational productions, \"The E-Flat Man\" might be among the least funny. It's mildly diverting and has a cute parody of the hitchhiking scene from \"It Happened One Night\", but otherwise I recommend you try one of his other films for the studio.\n\nThe plot involves Buster trying to elope with a young lady. However, they mistakenly take a police car instead of their own and are now wanted criminals. The police soon realize what happened but the pair still think they are wanted and spend too much of the film trying not to get caught. A rather listless plot, but it could be worse..."

This time out Elmer (Keaton) and his girlfriend (Dorothea Kent) are about to elope but while they're sneaking out of her house a robbery is taking place next door. The thieves head off in Keaton's car and the future husband and wife team accidentally take a police car. The couple hear that they're wanted by police so they go on the run but soon the police learn the truth but our young couple don't get the news that they're no longer wanted so they just keep running. THE E-FLAT MAN is yet another dud from Keaton and Educational. I think it's fair to say that no one should go into any of these Educational pictures expecting anything near his classic silent pictures but at the same time I don't think it's too much to ask that they at least deliver a few laughs but sadly that never happens. This is a pretty flat story from start to finish as the screenplay really doesn't offer us anything we haven't seen countless times before. Fans of Keaton's THE SCARECROW will see a similar scenes here but you'll also see how badly it doesn't work here. There's even a spoof of the hitchhiking scene from IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT but it too falls flat on its face. We even get a bizarre ending on board a train that comes out of no where and ends just as fast without the joke ever paying off. The one saving grace is that Keaton and Kent at least has some nice chemistry together. Keaton's performance is somewhat lacking but Kent is so cute and charming that she'll at least put a smile on your face."

                "text": "Janet Gaynor is best remembered for being the star of three silent classics, SEVENTH HEAVEN, SUNRISE, and STREET ANGEL, for which the then 22-year-old actress won the first Best Actress Academy Award and became the last superstar of the silent era. She was wildly popular in the 1930's as well, right up to her self-imposed retirement in 1938. In the early 1930's she was in fact the most popular young actress on the screen. Alas, because most of her films were made by Fox and have had little circulation since initial release (with the very notable exception of the classic A STAR IS BORN), she tends to be overlooked among the thirties stars today. SMALL TOWN GIRL, however, is better known than most of her films mainly because the MGM film airs quite often on TCM.\n\nSMALL TOWN GIRL is an excellent light romantic drama with an utterly endearing and empathic performance by Janet. She stars as a twenty-something girl who has become bored out of her mind by the daily routine of her life - working at her brother-in-law's \"mom and pop\" grocery, customers buying the same things every week, eating the same meals every specific day of the week, having to listen to mindless small talk of customers as well as the repetitive comments of friends and relatives. Perhaps worst of all is her utterly unromantic and unambitious semi-boyfriend James Stewart. Janet appears to be the only person in town who knows there's a better way of life out there but she's powerless to find it. When the kids of a nearby college and young football fans cause a slight traffic jam passing through town going to a game, Janet looks on with wistfulness at their carefree, fun, and promising lives. After almost being run down by handsome (make that gorgeous) Robert Taylor, he stops and they talk a bit. He asks is she knows a short cut to the tavern he's headed to and with his warm personality and obvious breeding has little difficulty persuading her to join him. They have a wonderful evening and Taylor gets quite plastered (apparently a frequent occurrence for him) and Janet herself imbibes in champagne for the first time but remains sober. Driving her home, Taylor impulsively decides to propose to her and drives to the justice of the peace where some of his friends were just married. Janet protests mildly but finds herself unable to turn away from this prince charming that dropped in her lap from out of nowhere and finally agrees to marry him.\n\nDriving away after becoming man and wife, the ever intoxicated Taylor runs off the road in a slight crash in a ditch and falls asleep. The next morning, he sobers up and doesn't remember anything but learns he is now a married man. When he learns Janet wasn't drunk at the time they married he suspects her of being a fortune hunter, meanwhile she learns he was already engaged to socialite Binnie Barnes and he's the son of a wealthy man and is a promising young doctor. Taylor decides to avoid scandal they will live as man and wife in-name-only for six months and then divorce. He is quite cool now to Gaynor whom he sees as an opportunist and his hostile demeanor has Janet now disliking him as well. But as time passes Janet recaptures the attraction and affection she initially felt for him whereas he is still waiting for the day the marriage will end and he can openly see Binnie Barnes.\n\nJanet Gaynor gives a wonderful performance in this movie, the viewer is completely with her at all stages. Her sincerity shines through every scene and shows you why 30's audiences loved her so much. She is very fine in the early scenes fully capturing small town discontentment as well as her impetuous first night with Taylor and she never makes a false move throughout the film. Robert Taylor is so dashing it's hard to imagine any woman who could resist his charms. He is excellent and like Janet, you can't help but being drawn to him even when he is unsympathetic because you know he is better than his actions. The supporting cast generally has insignificant roles but James Stewart (in one of his first films) is so credible as the bland boy next door it's a wonder he didn't end up typecast for good as the Ralph Bellamy of rural films, the perennial second placer. Elizabeth Patterson as Janet's mother and Lewis Stone as Robert's father do what they can with their small roles and it was fun to see a toddler on screen (Janet's sister Isabell Jewell's daughter) being a picky-eating little brat unlike most films of the era with perfectly mannered children. SMALL TOWN GIRL is a small gem in MGM's crown and most definitely worth seeing."

But I've seen her in films like State Fair and Three Loves Has Nancy and it's the same part, the girl from the tiny hamlet who conquers the big city and the men in it. With a title like this, there was only one casting possibility.\n\nJanet's a girl who's thoroughly stuck in a rut in her New England hamlet and yearns for a little adventure. She finds it in the person of Robert Taylor, a young doctor who comes from a wealthy Boston family. After a night's carousing Gaynor and Taylor are married, to the chagrin of his fianc\u00e9, Binnie Barnes and her boyfriend James Stewart. \n\nRemember this is Boston so Taylor's father Lewis Stone prevails on Taylor to give the marriage a few months trial. Of course this is where the balance of the story comes in. In many ways this plot seems like a harbinger of The Way We Were.\n\nTaylor's career was now in full swing as Small Town Girl was the next film after his breakout performance in Magnificent Obsession. Remember in that film he was a playboy who became a doctor. Here's he's a doctor who doubles as a playboy. Never mind though, feminine hearts all over the English speaking world were fluttering over MGM's latest heartthrob. My mother who was a juvenile at this time told me that Taylor's appeal back in these days was just about the same as Elvis's.\n\nJames Stewart was at the beginning of his career as well as MGM had him in about seven features in 1936, mostly in support. Interesting though with worse career management, he could have gone on playing hick roles like Elmer the boyfriend. But it was also obvious there was a spark of stardom with him as well.\n\nGaynor would leave the screen a few years later, Taylor was at the beginning of his career. He'd have better acting roles in his future, but for now Small Town Girl is a great example of the screen heartthrob he was at the beginning of his stardom. Fans of both stars will like what they see in Small Town Girl."

He has more to do in \"Murder Man,\" which is actually earlier than this film. MGM seemed to just stick him where they needed him, as they did Spencer Tracy in his early years.

I have been watching all the films of his, I can get my hands on. \n\nDue to left-wing folks in Hollywood, who took his blacklisting response on communism too much to heart, he has been slowly erased from MGM, TCM, Warner classics, etc. Since his passing in 1969. Fear not- RT fans- he is making a come-back, and I am one of the few loyal fans on this planet who will partake in bringing back the magic he had on the silver-screen.\n\n\"Small Town Girl\" Is one of his earlier pictures, what with his being only twenty-four years of age during its production. He made a lot of great movies this year, including \"His Brother's Wife\" Where he met and got to know pal and future failed marriage, Barbara Stanwyck. He also had his big break later in the year with Greta Garbo in \"Camille\" which is one of the few films that withstood the test of time and people still know about- only because of Garbo, of course. Anyhow, I digress; Janet Gaynor. Never had heard of her before this film, even despite being raised on all of the classics, 1920s onward (And even before) but now I am so happy this was my first impression of her. \n\nGaynor's portrayal of Katherine Brannan, or Kay, as she is so called, is spot-on. She has the most impeccable expressions, when it comes to the various emotions of this character throughout the film. There's the frustration in the beginning of a girl, being trapped in her own family, not being able to relate to them the way she perhaps, once had. I relate to her, so I suppose that's ultimately why I adore this film so much. I love my family, and I have recently returned to them, which is another reason I love it, cause she sees how important that is when the time comes... then there's the sassy, catty version of Miss Brannan, where she really tries hard to be the newly-wed of Mr T's character Bob \"Doc\" Dakin. (Whenever I read his name before, the Englishman in me pronounced it \"Daw-kin\" when really it is Day-kin) \n\nNow for Mr Taylor... Ahhhhh Mr Taylor. His performance couldn't have been done better by anyone. And I mean it! Not just cause I am biased and adore the man, but to play the scuzzy-playboy in the beginning, you have no inkling is in a relationship, actually- affianced to Priscilla, and then to play this sweet innocent Kay and to take her for a ride, in all senses of the word (besides the modern vulgarity) Ohhh and then how he develops as she makes him a better doctor, a better professional- a better PERSON! Love his performance, and hers.\n\nThis is a must-see if you like any fun films from the '30s, specially '36!\n\nENJOY. and pay close attention, most quotable little dramedy, I've ever seen."

                "text": "When big city folk invade the New England town of Carvel for a big game, STG Janet Gaynor ends up on a sudden date with BTB Robert Taylor and after a night of champagne, ends up in front of a JIP. It's a definite case of WTH the next morning when they wake up in his car with a marriage license sitting between them. This Carvel is no relation to the home of Andy Hardy in the series which began the following year at MGM, but like some omen (bad or good), Lewis Stone is cast here as Taylor's very serious father. He's a doctor who works at a Boston clinic, and is involved with the snooty and selfish Binnie Barnes who agrees to go away for six months to avoid the scandal while Taylor and Gaynor pretend to be on their honeymoon and attempting to make their marriage work.\n\nComedy erupts on Taylor's yacht as Gaynor deals with sea sickness, even though she's ordered the most magnificent of foods she feels are typical high society cuisine. But once they settle into their marriage, Gaynor's feelings become clear even though Barnes' sudden return from her trip means nights alone as he neglects her and the clinic (especially a young patient who adores him) and Barnes simply hangs up the phone when Gaynor desperately tries to get ahold of him. \"Uncle Henry\" Charley Grapewin is dapper here as the well dressed head of the clinic who has no faith in Taylor's future as a top doctor, thinking him a fool and warning Stone that he may not have a long future if his frivolous behavior continues.\n\nThis is at its most entertaining during the first half, although at over 100 minutes, it does tend to drag a bit. At times, Gaynor's small own girl is totally like Esther Blodgett during the early scenes, even though she adds some glamour along the way covering provincial innocence that Barnes considers non-threatening. But classic Hollywood always gave the underdog the man, and while Taylor may seem at home in fancy nightclubs (the one in Carvel seems way out of place) and on yachts, he's certainly not going to find happiness with the selfish Binnie no matter how much she tries to manipulate him. It's no surprise to discover that \"A Star is Born's\" William Wellman directed this, and it would be Gaynor's next role which brought her screen immortality.\n\nJoining Taylor, Gaynor, Barnes and Stone are James Stewart as Gaynor's small town admirer (really given nothing to do), Nella Walker as Taylor's kindly society matron mother (who sees through Barnes and obviously would prefer Gaynor), as well as Frank Craven and Elizabeth Patterson as Gaynor's parents and Andy Devine as their son-in-law whose seemingly giant baby pelts everybody with rice pudding and potatoes. It's typical MGM light romantic fare where the praises of home and family explodes off the screen, city people are presented as pretentious and short-sighted to the rest of the world, and the sweet country folk are praised as only as Louis B. Mayer could demand them to be."

Janet Gaynor is superb and it's interesting to note that Jean Harlow was the first choice, because that would have given this picture an entirely different flavor. \n\nAnd here's an interesting bit of trivia: there are more than a few connections to MGM's popular Andy Hardy. The small town that Gaynor's character comes from is called Carvel. The stage play that served as the basis for the Hardy series set the action in a fictitious Idaho town called Carvel, but in most of the Andy Hardy movies, the location is much more generalized and is basically Carvel, USA. But in this film, it is clearly established that Carvel is in the east. Road signs during one of the scenes indicate that Carvel is 97 miles from Boston.\n\nJanet Gaynor would re-team with director William Wellman for A Star Is Born. Meanwhile, MGM would remake this film in 1953, with musical scenes, starring Ann Blyth and Farley Granger."

I found the entire plot totally predictable, from beginning to end. There is not a single surprise throughout the entire movie. It almost became laughable predicting what was going to happen next.\n\nThe cast, however, was quite good in their performances in spite of the script. So I give them kudos for making the most of it. Gaynor is very likable, so much so that you find yourself rooting for her. Taylor of course is smashingly good-looking, but also has an approachable charm to him that endeared him to so many movie fans. I think they did a horrible job on his makeup though. His eyebrows looked painted on and the eyeshadow was too noticeable at times. Binnie Barnes was easy to hate in her portrayal as the ruthless fianc\u00e9, so she did her role justice.\n\nI think the ending was worst of all. I hated that they brought Gaynor's boyfriend, Jimm Stewart, back in the picture and had him gushing over her again. She gives the impression she might be interested, only to have Taylor show up in his fast sports car and whisk her off. I think it makes women look flighty and trifling with men's hearts. I think it did Gaynor's likable character an injustice."

Janet Gaynor had been drinking, but she knew what she was doing and took the opportunity to get out of her small-town humdrum life. To me, the situation is virtually impossible, and what J.P. would marry a man who is that pie-eyed?  Still, once the event happens, I found myself rather enjoying most of the rest of the movie despite its predictability. Only the yacht trip dragged a little.\n\nI confess I was never a Taylor or Gaynor fan when I say that the best one in the film is 8th-billed James Stewart, playing Gaynor's home-town boyfriend. It wasn't too much longer when his star shone much brighter than either of the two stars in this film."

While it pales in comparison with Hitchcock's seminal original \u0096 a rare expressionist film to emerge from Britain \u0096 especially since this has the tendency typical of early Talkies to emphasize dialogue (which is so muffled as to be unintelligible most of the time anyway, a deficiency which unfortunately seems to plague most British films I've seen from this era) at the expense of technique. As a matter of fact, the latter is only apparent during the atmospheric, fog-laden climax in which leading lady Elizabeth Allen mistakes the real Ripper-type murderer for the young man who lodges with her family (Ivor Novello, who reprises his role from the Hitchcock classic!).\n\nDespite its basic purposelessness (though I would guess that a remake was commissioned, so soon after the Silent version, not so much to have a Talkie of the intriguing story \u0096 based on a popular novel \u0096 but more in response to the American horror boom of the early 30s), the plot is compelling enough to keep one watching\u0085and predictable enough to be followed, so that it could have dispensed with dialogue altogether. The film features an impossibly young Jack Hawkins in one of his earliest roles as a fast-talking reporter (!) and Allen's fianc\u00e9, whose jealousy of Novello leads to the latter being targeted as prime suspect of the killings (also because his background, and wardrobe, is strikingly similar to that of the murderer)! \n\nAs I said earlier, perhaps the film's best sequence \u0096 at least with respect to direction \u0096 is its denouement; however, the changes done to the ending from the Hitchcock original are unconvincing and unsatisfying (especially since the romantic triangle at the centre of the plot isn't resolved\u0085though this may very well have been trimmed for the American version, hence its abruptness."

                "text": "\nWARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOW IN COMPARING PLOTS OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS!!!\n\nOne of the most important silent films still in existence is Hitchcock's third feature and the first to bear his personal style, THE LODGER.  It stars the young and beautiful Ivor Novello (matinee idol and later significant composer of eight English operettas).  Six years after this triumph, the UK remade the film as a talkie with a new director, Maurice Elvey, and although the screenplay was altered, it again starred Ivor Novello as the key suspect.    This was perhaps a mistake.  While the rest of the cast seem perfectly at ease with the naturalism of film dialogue, Mr. Novello is extremely mannered in a style reminiscent of the nineteenth century British stage and often either overacts or acts badly.  He is insecure and out of sync with what is going on around him, whereas under the sure direction of Hitchcock he gave a fine performance in the first version. This second version is not a very good film or a very good talkie.  It does have going for it Elizabeth Allan and Jack Hawkins as the young lovers, both giving energetic and completely natural performances.   We come away remembering them, not the plot or the Novello character.\n\nPlot changes from the original involve:  lodger's arrival at the Buntings is met by Daisy, not Mrs. Bunting and he is not wearing the face-masking scarf; Daisy is a telephone operator, not a model; a court scene is added where a criminologist identifies the murderer as a foreigner who hates all women because his wife deserted him; lodger's profession is that of a composer here, rather than an aristocrat, which fits in with his the actor's own first love; rather than have the suspected lodger be innocent in that he is the brother of the first victim, trying to track down the murderer, here he is the brother of the true murderer, attempting to find him and stop him. Either works well if indeed our suspected murderer MUST be innocent but I prefer the plot of the 1944 third version where our suspicions have been justly founded.\n\nNovello made sixteen silent films and only six talkies.  His style is best suited to the silent melodrama where he achieved great success.  It is perhaps well that he left films when he did - the world is a much better place with his marvelous music in it than it would have been with more melodramatic acting."

There is so much done to make Ivor Novello look like the bad guy that we know immediately that he is not it. He is made much more quirky and not mysterious enough. At times he lapses into normalcy and quickly moves back to this eccentric, almost unapproachable being. The plot, of course, involves a \"Jack the Ripper\" figure who is killing women near telephone boxes. Novello's character shows up and rents an apartment at the home of an older woman and her husband. The female interest is also there. Because \"London is lonely,\" he strikes up a relationship with the young woman, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend, a loudmouthed, overbearing character. People are suspicious of the foreign visitor and when he is discovered with blood on him, he is handcuffed but escapes. There is great concern for the young woman who, by the way, should be scared and should be looking out for herself. I will not spoil the end, but it is not nearly as captivating as the Hitchcock version, where the man is hunted mercilessly. The speeches are really hard to make out; alas, the new technology; and this really diminishes the effectiveness. See this as a curiosity. It just doesn't work very well."

I hope I find a few more in my collection. The transfer copy must have been very old and it is probably a title hard to come by, which would account for the occasional blotches on the print and garbled sound track, but it really is better than the 6 rating it presently sports, and I gave it a rating of 7."

                "text": "As an Ivor Novello enthusiast (you don't have to be nearly in your grave to be interested in this superlative Welsh superstar of the earlier 20th century!) my prime purpose in buying this DVD was to have an Ivor Novello talkie since the only other movie I have of him is the famous silent Lodger. So it was a delight to hear and see him in action. Also a delight to for the first time see him playing piano live. \n\nI presume the director decided this movie must not be a copy of the marvellous expressionist 1926 Hitchcock movie. So Novello is required to be relatively \"normal\" rather than as in the silent movie when his behaviour is so often disturbing. Unfortunately the normalness removes some of the tension. The Lodger still has opportunities to look guilty, but not enough. \n\n*****spoiler******** \n\nI think we understand far too soon that the lodger is not the Avenger. In the earlier movie, we could still wonder even after someone else is arrested when caught in the act. Seminal moments that are used to full effect by Hitchcock are glossed over in 1932, especially the Lodger's arrival in the fog which isn't sinister enough and his demand to have the pictures of pretty women removed - 1926 he turns them to the wall as in the book, so why change this in 1932 to a weak protest about preferring plain walls? The romance with Daisy is nicely acted and Novello is very accomplished at love scenes (no wonder women adored him) but lacks the startling charisma between Novello and the actress June in 1926 and the tension is lost somewhat when the Lodger says too much too soon re himself to Daisy. \n\nDaisy's parents are well acted although the landlady doesn't in this movie have that strange relationship with the Lodger that is in the other movie to some extent and very strongly in the book. \n\nJoe the brash journalist is well played by very young Jack Hawkins. \n\nThe finale is rather weak. Does the Lodger (Michel) actually murder his brother the Avenger? It seems so unless the Avenger has a heart attack and dies after Michel has prevented him killing Daisy. As both parts are played by Novello, we don't actually see the Avenger's death, just Michel crouching over his brother. It seems clear from Michel's weeping statement afterwards that he did actually commit murder or thinks he did in order to free his brother from the misery of his insanity. \n\nDaisy comforts Michel and says he is now safe, no one can hurt him now. But we don't learn if Michel is to be free - or will he be hanged for murder? Impossible to know without some further information although it's ominous as Michel has no wish to hide what he has, or thinks he has, done. The movie stops here very abruptly. \n\nAnnoying too to learn this version I have is probably shortened by about 20 minutes. Does this mean there are further scenes which show what happens next and what else is missing? \n\nI don't entirely agree with those reviews that say this is a weak movie but it's certainly not as good as the 1926 and the unfortunate American title (the original title was also The Lodger) which belittles this classic story into any old horror story. However, one is comparing good with exceptional. \n\nI happened to see a later version of this story with Jack Palance which is good on tension and stays more closely to the book so it seems clear the Lodger is the Avenger. Palance acts the part very well although lacks that amazing charisma Novello has that lights up the screen no matter what he does. But Palance isn't meant to be beautiful but fated which was so often Novello's movie setup, but instead inspires plenty of fear at his increasingly obvious strangeness. \n\nThere's a magnificent book \"Ivor Novello Screen Idol\" by Michael Williams that delves deep into the Lodger, Novello's style, etc, and explains a great deal about expressionism and Hitchcock. Rewatching The Lodger both versions after reading this book was particularly interesting. \n\nNote the pun in the Lodger's name in this movie? Michel Angelo - Michaelangelo. I wonder who thought that up - possibly Novello who so we're told had a wicked sense of humour."

Only the twist ending takes a slightly different turn this time - but see for yourself! \n\nOf course, this film can't reach the class of Hitchcock's masterpiece; but seen for itself, it's still a very neat and scary classic whodunit - especially the nightly London fog scenes are extremely suspenseful.

His increasingly suspicious behaviour lead people to suspect him of the murders. Daisy is the only one who believes in him.\n\nThe 1926 Lodger was far superior. Being a silent film Novello's character was mysterious but you could put your own interpretation on his actions - in this version his heavy Bela Lugsi type accent make you view him with suspicion. Also there was a scene involving a locked cupboard that was not followed up ( obviously I, too, saw the short \"Phantom Fiend\" version). In the silent version it was found to have a map of the murderer's route and locks of a girl's hair. This was explained in a much more satisfying ending.

Actor Ivor Novello appeared in both as the title character, exuding a finely nuanced and mysterious performance in both, though he was probably a bit creepier in the original version. His first appearance on screen in the earlier picture had him with a wrap across his face, hinting a bit too obviously that he might be the \"Avenger\" killer. In this picture, he appears as a more refined individual, a practiced musician, who inadvertently seems to match up to the real Avenger's description perfectly.\n\nFor purposes of this story, the character of Joe Martin (Jack Hawkins) is made a newspaper reporter instead of a police detective. Though introduced as a suitor for pretty Daisy Bunting (Elizabeth Allan), he comes off as a boorish lout, and you'll probably wonder as I did what Daisy might have ever seen in him in the first place.\n\nIt was curious to see how way back in the early Thirties, criminal psychology painted a picture of the 'call box murderer' as someone with an 'unhinged brain'. The Avenger had developed an animosity toward all women after his wife deserted him, taking out his revenge on blonde women in the heart of London. The picture leaves some room for interpretation as to whether Michel Angeloff (Novello) might have known the real killer, (the name sounded like Stephan Ovanitch to me, but that character isn't listed in the credits). Angeloff uttered Stephan's name just before he saved Daisy from attack, but it could be he learned of that name from the press.\n\nJust before that though, Angeloff made his retreat from a local pub as frightened patrons identified him as The Avenger. I had to wonder how they concluded that, since the papers never printed a picture of the unhinged Stephan, who Angeloff did bear an uncanny resemblance to. Then, once the crowd began to follow him out the door, Angeloff somehow manages to elude them off-screen to make the save for Daisy. The chase scene in 1927's 'Lodger' led to an entirely different conclusion, and the abruptness of this picture's finale caught me somewhat off guard.\n\nBoth pictures, this one and the original, both have their merits. Hard to say which one of the two is 'better', although Alfred Hitchcock fans will want to see the earlier version for a look at the master well before he refined his film making style. It's also the first of Hitch's pictures in which he makes a cameo, one of the hallmarks of his later efforts."

Long pauses too make the film interminable and setting it in modern times seems to take away the gloriously gloomy atmosphere that makes the London fog seem like a character more than just a weather condition. \n\nThe future Lucy Nannette of MGM's \"A Tale of Two Cities\", Elizabeth Allen. is certainly lovely and has a gentle demeanor which makes her the perfect screen heroine. But the lack of truth on the re-telling is a major detriment so I must put this one as a missed opportunity that fails to impress"

                "text": "Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Lodger\" is one of the best mystery/suspense films of the silent era. However, with the advent of sound, there was a huge push to remake these silents into new talking versions. While some might have applauded it, the results were not always positive. Take \"The Phantom Fiend\". It is a shabby remake of the original in every way--but the most glaring is the strange performance by the lead, Ivor Novello. While he was just fine in the Hitchcock version, her in the remake he's simply awful. Part of it was his bizarre accent he approximated for the film and part of it was his overacting. The intention was for the audience to suspect, like everyone else, that he was a psychopathic murderer. So why, then, did he overdo it so much? He behaves like a crazy man throughout the film and this made the ending all the more improbable. Having Hitchcock as the director of the remake might have solved this and a good director should have seen the deficiencies in Novello's characterization--but this one did not. My advice is just watch the original and let that be enough. If you do want to see \"The Lodger\", it's available for free download at archive.org--or just follow the link on IMDb for the download."

The first clue that we are in the pre-Code era is the skimpy outfit worn by Mary Carlisle as Satan's secretary--hot hot hot. Burns and Satan have a brief exchange loaded with topical references of the day: when the secretary announces a call from Chicago, machine gun fire is heard in the background, and there is some banter about Scarface as well. Also, Satan reacts with disgust when the possibility of a stockbroker coming their way is raised by Burns (remember, this is not long after the stock market crash).\n\nEventually Burns heads to Earth (and a speakeasy) for more recruits. Those induced to go to Hades to keep the good times rolling arrive via slide, where they are treated to most jaw-dropping scene of all: a fairly lavish (for a short) music and dance number, where the dancers rip off their modest, fit-for-a-Quaker outfits to reveal their \"satanic\" (and scanty) outfits (complete with little horns), and surround a giant, illuminated devil's head that rises out of the center stage. Along with the \"Marijuana\" musical number in Murder at the Vanities, this is one of the pre-Code musical bits most likely to surprise modern audiences; I'm sure some religious types would take offense even now. One can only imagine what they thought back in 1931 (I guess the movement to enforce the Production Code, which achieved success in 1934, might offer a clue!)\n\nThis film is also a very good example of the two-strip technicolor technique used sporadically before the full, three-strip process was introduced in Becky Sharp (1935). The two-strip process doesn't really render hues of blue, but that flaw is not overwhelming in a short largely set in the reddish confines of \"Hades\".\n\nYou may need the luck of the Devil to catch this treat on TCM, so keep watching!"

Up until 1934, the studios pretty much made whatever they wanted despite the Hays Office being there to ostensibly oversee the industry to make sure the films were acceptable for families. Not until the new Production Code came into effect in '34 did things change. The nudity, drugs, violence, sexual innuendos and rough language all were pretty much eliminated from films for decades and films became family friendly, though a tad sanitized as well. Here in this 1930 short from MGM, tons of material that the Production Code would have eliminated is present--and reveling in it!! \n\nThe film is set mostly in Hell and takes great advantage of the Two-color Technicolor process. Instead of full color, the film consisted of a black & white image, a green-blue image and a red-orange image all superimposed on each other. It was not true color but in a few films it looked really good (such as in the 1929 re-release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and in this film)--because of the subject and setting of the film. Often, however, over time the colors have either completely disappeared (resulting in a black & white movie) or the colors bleed so badly that the film is almost 100% orange--and an ugly mess.\n\nIt begins with one of the demons (in a nice suit) talking with a similarly dressed Lucifer. They are both upset because too many souls are going to Heaven and they are apparently losing the contest. So, it's up to Satan's #1 demon to go up to Earth and do some recruiting. With promises of a \"heck\" of a good time, tons of incredibly stupid young people come pouring into Netherworld for a huge party--complete with lots of dancing and an absolutely amazing set that you just have to see to believe.\n\nSo what's to like and what's to hate? Well, I must admit that some of the jokes are very, very corny and some of the dancing isn't very good compared to what was being made just a year or two later. In addition, some religious people will find the whole thing rather distasteful. However, on the plus side, this is the most astoundingly strange and original short I have ever seen from Hollywood, a great example of early color, is very entertaining and is historically significant in so many ways. While some might see these early shorts as old fashioned or expendable, they are a hugely important part of our cinematic history and what better way to illustrate how incredibly uninhibited and free people actually thought and acted during the supposedly conservative 1930s?! An absolute must for film historians, lovers of the strange and early film buffs."

Very effectively filmed in red/brown 2 color Technicolor by MGM and utilizing the Satan Chrous from TIME, the deco splendor of the office and the fun-park of the cabaret still shock today: you enter by sliding down the Devil's tongue into the pit of the dance floor where Chorus girls clad in Puritan outfits then wildly rip them off and jiggle about in their skimpy underwear. Our maitre'd crooner hands out cards dominoes and any sinful gambling device to have all the wicked fun you could desire, then the floor show commences of the edited TIME sequence: this consists of a jaw-dropping scene of ballet chorus girls wearing reddish sheer/lace outfits who dance around this gigantic Devil's head. Other shockers are: the rude jokes to a fat woman which are are just cruel, Satan's desk has a massive fat phallus near the edge behind which stands an assistant in a black suit... the whole thing positioned exactly in front of his pants.... all in hilariously vulgar offensive fun. THE DEVIL'S CABARET is a censorship-free time capsule of exactly why the Hays code was firmly enforce from may 1934. See it and show it to your friends so they scream and look shocked."

To go even further we get the scene where Burns tries to talk people into various crimes but then insults an overweight woman by saying she isn't welcomed in Hades because if she sat down her weight would put out all the fires! There are also two musical numbers, which are pretty creative. Director Grinde is best known for his Columbia pictures with Boris Karloff (THE MAN THEY COULD NOT HANG, THE MAN WITH NINE LIVES, BEFORE I HANG) but he does a very good job here."

This weird MGM 16 minute short film in an early technicolor process is one of the weirdest films I have ever seen. It culminates in a ballet, with music composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, with girls in red tutus wearing devil's horns prancing beneath a gigantic face of a horned Satan. It is meant to be a riotously funny musical comedy, and the jokes are just about as corny as you can get, such as: 'That's the hell of it!' Satan's Vice President gets hold of St. Peter on the phone and accuses him of stealing all their clients. The film is saucy and sexy, what is known as 'pre-Code', before the ridiculous censorship code of the Hays Office was enforced, which meant that everything must be toned down and married couples on screen were only allowed to sleep in double beds. This film is so outrageous that it would be nice if it were really funny, or really entertaining at least, but I thought that it was a complete flop. Some of the jokes were funny in theory but were delivered so badly that it was impossible to laugh or even chuckle. The acting is so ridiculous, the film so badly made, the jokes so feeble, the dancing so absurd, that this strange curiosity should have been left in the cabinet."

She makes a chump out of street smart Jimmy.\n\nI don't think I have to say too much more. Guy Kibbee as Cagney's manager and Clarence Muse as his corner man fill their roles very well.\n\nThe only two things that Winner Take All became noted for was that this was the first time Cagney did a boxing film. He got into the ring later on in The Irish in Us and City for Conquest. But also footage from this film was used in that last Cagney made for TV film Terrible Joe Moran. \n\nThat film was a mistake whereas this one is strictly routine."

                "text": "James Cagney played more than gangsters and dancers during his early years as a contract star at Warner Brothers. In director Roy Del Ruth's \"Winner Take All,\" a funny, fast-paced Pre-Code boxing saga, he plays a lovable, thick-headed Bronx pug named 'Knockout' Jim Kane whose manager Pop Slavin (Guy Kibbee of \"Babbitt\") packs him off to a camp in the middle of the desert to regain his health after too much booze, broads, and beatings. The long shots of the boxing arenas as well as the locomotive are often as striking as are some later wildlife footage.\n\nEssentially, this romantic comedy/boxing epic is featherweight fare with competent performances. In other words, nothing tragic happens. Nobody is in jeopardy, except where money plays a part or sexual misconduct occurs. Remember this is a Pre-Code opus so Virginia Bruce shuffling through her apartment in her undies is pretty erotic for 1932. The Robert (\"Dr. Socrates\" Lord) & Wilson (\"Heroes for Sale\") Mizner screenplay contains dialogue that is often witty and memorable for such a largely disposable escapade. Del Ruth stages each scene with finesse for the spartan sets in which they occur. An excellent example of his function but dramatic mise en scene is the deal in the boxing office when Kane makes his comeback.\n\n\"Winner Take all\" opens in crowded Madison Square Garden. The ring announcer introduces Kane to a jubilant audience. \"Before we begin the main event, I'd like to say a few words about a boy who needs no introduction. A boy who has fought his way up to the very top, an old friend, and an old favorite 'Knock out Jimmy Kane. After a dozen tough fights, but his rough fighting has cost him and has to take off to recuperate. He needs financial help so the crowd showers him with money. The next scene his manager and trainer Rosebud (Clarence Muse of \"God Is My Co-Pilot\") advise him to take it easy for six months while he is recuperating out in the desert.\n\nAt the Rosario Ranch and Hot Springs, Kane feels lonely and out of place. The Interne at Rosario Ranch (George 'Gabby' Hayes) explains the schedule; bedtime at 10 PM and breakfast at 7AM. Kane hears coyotes howling his first night in residence and is curious about them. The long shots of the coyote are eye-catching and look like perfect stock footage for a vampire movie. Kane traipses onto the balcony. Peggy Harmon (Marion Nixon) and he chat about coyotes. They become fast friends when Kane remembers her from a night at a New York restaurant. Here, Del Ruth presents a flashback that depicts the incident. During this flashback, we are treated to a cameo of another Warner Brothers tough guy taken from the 1929 film \"Queen of the Night Clubs\"; indeed, it's George Raft as the conductor. Peggy is at Kane's table and she irritates Kane's blond girlfriend (Charlotte Merriam) who starts a fight.\n\nEventually, Kane meets Peg's adolescent son Dickie Harmon (Dickie Moore of \"Sergeant York\") whose is recuperating, too. Things take a turn for the worst for Peggy after she learns that her late husband's insurance policy won't cover the length of time required to stay at the facility to heal her son. She needs $600. Kane sneaks off to Tijuana, Mexico and schedules a fight against Joe Pice (Julian Rivero of \"Guys and Dolls\") with a $2000 winner take all purse. The fight promoter doesn't trust Kane because 'Knockout' hasn't boxed in a year. He fears that Kane will take a dive for the $600 and demands all or nothing. Kane pummels Pice in the ring. Pice hits the mat moments before Kane in a scene that pre-dates a similar scene in \"Rocky 2.\" The referee hands the decision to Kane, and Kane pays Peggy's bill. Peggy is overwhelmed with gratitude. Predictably, when he learns about Kane's comeback, Pop isn't happy. Dickie's treatment isn't finished by the time that Kane heads back to New York. Before he leaves, Kane promises Peggy that they will get married.\n\nOnce he arrives back in the Big Apple, Kane crosses paths with vampy, Park Avenue type Joan Gibson (Virginia Bruce) and forgets Peg. Joan pulls jokes on him to keep him out of her room the first night they date. She asks him to behave like a gentlemen and drops her handkerchief. When he stoops to retrieve it, she slips inside her room and pulls the door shut. Joan likes Kane until he has plastic surgery and complains that he now looks ordinary. Says Joan to a friend, \"The fool took me seriously went and had his face done over. Now, he's lost all the things that made him colorful and different. He's just ordinary, now like any other guy.\" She adds that she cannot tolerate bad grammar spoken through a perfect Grecian face.\n\nKane's attitude changes after his plastic surgery because he is afraid another pug will break his nose or smash his ear. He dances around fighters and the crowds start booing him. He earns a reputation as a guy who avoids punches. Pop knows what is going on and sends for Peggy. She surprises Kane when she arrives in town. Meanwhile, Kane stomps over to Joan's apartment and learns that she isn't at home. Nevertheless, he ignores the butler and finds her at home. He is righteously upset and kisses her and tells her he is all she needs. Kane's quarrels with both Peggy and Joan intensify and the resolution will keep you laughing. Cagney's performance and his accent are wonderful and the entire cast scores points for perfection. \"Winner Take All\" is a snappy little boxing number. Don't miss it!"

The character of Kane is interesting because he seems to have no ties to anyone and is a loner of an extreme even Cagney didn't play much. Cagney, of course excels. There is a nifty little scene with Ralfe Harold who sells hot jewelry, and Virginia Bruce, who should have been a much bigger star, scorches the furniture in every scene she's in. I'll take V.B. any day over most of the other '30s fire-eaters .

                "text": "\"Winner Take All\" is initially most notable for the disturbing facial make-up of Jimmy Cagney, playing a boxer; for most of the movie, his nose is flattened and crooked, his ear is cauliflowered (although you probably wouldn't notice it if it wasn't mentioned), and he sticks his lips out in a way that helps physically manifest Cagney's character's stupidity and general insensitivity.\n\nThe boxing scenes are great, and would be quite convincing even in a later decade, never mind 1932. It really does seem like many hundreds of people have gathered together in an arena to watch Cagney fight. And he dances around with ease and grace, and is quite convincing as a gladiator of the squared circle (In one fight, Cagney and his opponent knock each other down, with Cagney winning the fight by barely getting up on his feet before the 10-count ends; isn't this how Rocky Balboa took the championship from Apollo Creed 45 years later?)\n\nThe most appealing scenes of the movie are in the beginning, when Cagney romances the pretty Marian Nixon at the desert health resort. Here, he courts Ms. Nixon with consideration and gentleness, and it is quite pleasing. It is therefore disappointing when Cagney turns out to be a rather dimwitted two-timer. He never really gets the glow back that he has in the first 15 minutes, and we never quite like him the same way again.\n\nUnusual also for the time period is the good-sized role with many lines given to the African-American actor Clarence Muse. For once a black man is treated more or less with the same respect as the other characters, without that depressing over-obsequiousness normally demanded of black characters in Hollywood's early years.\n\nAnd though his role is brief, Alan Mowbray, as Cagney's instructor of society manners, manages, as usual, to be hilarious with his mannered fastidiousness and what we might call exaggerated metrosexuality. He is one of my favorite character actors.\n\nThe film moves briskly through its quick 66 minutes, and even though the ending is somewhat sudden and unsatisfactory (Nixon is clearly Cagney's second choice for a wife; and he will marry her with a stolen ring intended for someone else), the world is still much better off with these quick films that Warner Brothers pumped out in joyfully large volumes in the truly golden film era of the 1930s."

Instead, it's more a chance for Cagney to play a shallow and stereotypical \"loudmouthed\" role--something that keeps this film from being anything more than a time passer.\n\nThe main controversy in this film isn't boxing per se, but Cagney's desire to chase the wrong woman and compromise who he is in order to get her. At the same time, there's a very nice woman and her son who love him and are sorely neglected by Jimmy, as he's not all that likable and is pretty dim in this film. EVERYONE knows the woman he wants doesn't love him--that is, everyone but Jimmy. And the woman who loves him is so decent and sweet that it just becomes painfully obvious Cagney's character is an idiot AND you know that according to formula, no matter what he does, by the end he'll get the \"nice girl\" instead.

Expensive place. \n\nWhen his stay is over, he leaves the health farm, but he and Peggy are in love and he'll be back. He becomes a big winner and attracts a woman who is captivated by him Joan (Virginia Bruce). Apparently she's holding out for a commitment because, despite her sexy clothes, he can't get to first base. He even has plastic surgery for her, to fix his nose and ears.

Had I been Peg and he told me he wanted to marry someone else AFTER she made the trip from New Mexico to New York, I would have accepted his ring, pawned it, and been gone on the next train. Oh well.\n\nTwo stories about him come to mind. One was told by Harold Kennedy, who had a small part in the film \"Run for Cover.\" He was supposed to run into a room and give Cagney some news. When they rehearsed it, Cagney was lying down and mumbled his response. When they filmed it, Cagney jumped up, grabbed him and started screaming.\n\nThe second story was told on \"Jeopardy\" by a man who had once worked in a restaurant. A man wearing an old raincoat walked in. He looked almost homeless. \"It turned out it was James Cagney,\" the man said, \"I never spoke to a sweeter person in my whole life.\"\n\nA unique star - a unique person - a great talent.

It's got Jimmy Cagney going for it, and even he seems confused at times, going through a few changes in speech pattern over the course of the movie. He starts out like a member of the East Side Kids and tries out a diction coach before getting the serious heave ho from society gal Joan Gibson (Virginia Bruce). She played her part well, making me wonder why Jimmy Kane (Cagney) didn't take her for a few rounds in the boxing ring to teach her a lesson.\n\nWhat bothered me about the picture was the way it rushed things along without a coherent explanation for things to come. Like the opening scene when Cagney's character is introduced prior to a prize fight by the ring announcer, with an appeal for fans to contribute money to send him away to a health camp. There was no mention of an ailment, only that he needed to get some rest. Then after meeting and falling for Peggy Harmon (Marian Nixon) at the ranch, he forgets about her just about as soon as he gets back to New York. He completely reverses character after hooking up with Gibson, fawning all over her and even getting a nose job to improve his appearance, with the attendant result of a change in fighting style which turns off the fans. When he turns down a title fight with the lightweight champ I had to pinch myself, when would that ever happen? Probably a good reason for his manager (Guy Kibbee) to deck him for a wake up call.\n\nThe one scene I did enjoy was that flashback scene when Kane and Peggy reflect on the single time they met at a night club in the past. It was a throwback to \"The Public Enemy\" when Cagney squished Mae Clark's face with a grapefruit, but this time he used a seltzer bottle spray! I think if the picture carried through with more of that light hearted approach, it would have been much more enjoyable.\n\nMy main gripe I guess is that Cagney was a stronger character in stronger roles before this one, especially in the earlier mentioned gangster flick. Even when not top billed, his presence usually took over any scene he was in, whereas here, you sometimes wondered just what he was doing there in the first place."

                "text": "Who was actually the generally accepted Greatest Tenor In The World when Groucho & Chico Marx were supposedly negotiating his services in their 1936 film A Night At The Opera? After Enrico Caruso had died in 1921 Beniamino Gigli had been elevated to that position by the American public and (eventually) critics alike, a position he held to the mid '50's. A personal opinion: just for one example, Pavorotti was a sublime singer but even he never attained Gigli's subtlety, the \"honeyed-tones\", the depths of emotion; Gigli was as unique as Lanza - and Pavorotti - were in other ways. He started touring the world relentlessly from 1932 on after 12 years with the Metropolitan Opera in New York but still had the time to make a few films, none of which were artistic achievements however all of which were vehicles to show off and hear his wonderful voice. He was constantly surprised that he had a \"film career\". He filmed this throughout May 1936 in Berlin in both German and Italian versions.\n\nThe IMDb plot summary tells all \u0096 famous singer still grieving for dead wife after years is lined up as sucker for scheming cabaret singer and her \u0085 mentor; on the way she comes to respect the singer and change her plans. Gigli was well aware he was no Valentino and not really an actor, but his honesty shone through and he carried the picture - the songs were the main thing after all! Now, the excellent Bel Canto DVD has both versions with English subtitles and in both original and restored audio \u0096 you have to choose for yourself which you prefer, at present my personal choice being the Italian with original sound, slightly less choppy but with Gigli's speaking voice dubbed by an actor. The quality of the sound Mark Obert-Thorn got from Gigli's records for his various CD remaster projects over the last 20 years was generally astounding, but I'm afraid he wouldn't have been able to get very much of the same high standard out these soundtracks! The 11 musical selections include Che Gelida Manina from La Boheme, the Italian version has many stock scenes not in the German showing a rapt audience listening (how you can empathise!); Soltanto Tu, Maria composed by de Curtis especially for the film; and a beautifully gossamer and heart-wringing Ave Maria (in any of the 4 choices).\n\nMaybe his Forget Me Not was a better film, but Ave Maria was good too, very watchable and I'm glad it had such loving treatment by Bel Canto. And also maybe it's not the best introduction to Gigli for a newcomer as all of his sound recordings are available in many different packages and are much more preferable, but his films are useful additions for fans to flesh out the man."

                "text": "This is no ordinary Mickey Mouse short. In Mickey's Mellerdrammer the star player and his friends stage their own production of Harriet Beecher Stowe's hugely popular anti-slavery saga \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" so right away you know this is a cartoon of special historical interest, and one that treads in highly sensitive territory.\n\nDuring the 19th century there were numerous stage versions of Stowe's novel being performed nationwide, the most popular being the one written by George L. Aiken (1830-1876). This adaptation was a good old-fashioned barn-stormer featuring one-dimensional characters, flowery dialog, melodramatic excess, and exciting spectacle. The show premiered in 1852 and was still touring the provinces a half-century later, long after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Even rural folk who were inclined to regard the theater with disapproval were familiar with pious old Uncle Tom, wicked Simon Legree, fun-loving Topsy and the angelic Little Eva, and generations of Americans thrilled to the climactic flight of Eliza across the ice floes, pursued by bloodhounds. There was more to the play than spectacle, however. Stowe's novel was a major influence on anti-slavery sentiment in the U.S., and the play spread the word further. Times and public taste changed rapidly as the 20th century rolled on, but even as late as the 1930's many older American still cherished memories of seeing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" on stage. I don't know if Walt Disney was among those who saw the show as a child-- although I'd be surprised if he didn't --but in 1933 he and his animators devised this nostalgic tribute to the experience. In Mickey's Mellerdrammer Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Goofy, and the gang present their own budget-challenged rendition of the show for a raucous crowd in a barn converted into a theater for the occasion.\n\nIn this context there's no point in discussing Political Correctness; this, after all, is a cartoon that opens with Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their dressing rooms applying black-face makeup for their roles. You'll have to decide for yourself whether this cartoon is something you're comfortable watching. From the purely historical point of view this film gives modern day viewers a latter-day perspective (i.e. that of the early 1930s) on a popular entertainment phenomenon that had already spanned eight decades, a phenomenon of considerable socio-political significance. Lincoln himself joked that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" started the war. Even in such a brief and light-hearted treatment as it receives here, the material has weight. We witness something that goes back much further in time than the '30s, something meaningful that packs a lot more emotional heft than a routine movie of the period, certainly more than the average cartoon. In any case, we don't see much of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" itself. A couple of Aiken's famous lines are quoted, but the filmmakers were more interested in the strenuous efforts of the actors and the backstage crew to put on the show against all odds, and in the uninhibited response of the audience. There are lots of good gags, mostly based on the ragtag production values of the show staged by Mickey and his pals: the sets are makeshift, field hands are played by wooden cut-outs, and even the bloodhounds are fake. Theater buffs will enjoy such devices as the offstage horse whose galloping is suggested by rhythmic drumming, the cardboard \"ice floes\" operated by bicycle pedals, thunder mimicked by potatoes rolling across an inverted wash-tub, etc. Other bits are more typical of gags found in old cartoons, such as the patron asked to remove his large hat who reveals an even larger head of hair.\n\nThis film is available in a DVD set of black & white Mickey Mouse cartoons, where it was placed with several others in a separate section called \"From the Vaults\" containing works of a controversial nature. The officials of the current Disney organization who okay'd the release of Mickey's Mellerdrammer deserve thanks, for this film has genuine historical value and shouldn't be suppressed. Anyone with an interest in American history, race relations, and the 19th century stage will likely find it of interest. Not to mention cartoon buffs, of course!"

But, thanks to folks like me and wmorrow59 (who did a terrific review for this film), we won't let you forget! This cartoon begins with Mickey and Clarabelle donning black-face. It seems that the gang is putting on a performance of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"! Sure, this isn't at all politically correct today, but back in the 19th century it was a HUGELY popular book and play. But the sight of seeing Goofy and the rest in black-face is certainly stunning--and a reminder of just how far we've come as a society that now this sort of thing isn't to be laughed at...just seen with absolute shock!! All in all, if you can ignore the racial elements (and who can?!), it's not a terrible cartoon it's also a sign of the times. I sure hope the cartoon isn't totally buried, as it is a nice history lesson on our past. Maybe not a GOOD one, but a lesson nonetheless."

Early on we see some audience shots and afterward a brief look behind the stage, but for the rest of this film we watch basically a theater play including many Disney characters, some of them still appear in comic books today. The antagonist is not Pete this time, because it is just an antagonist in the play actually played by one of Mickey's pals. However, the audience is not so tolerant and eggs keep flying from all directions. The audience reactions were maybe also the funniest thing about this little movie, even if there were more entertaining moments. All in all, a decent early Disney film. Recommended."

It is somewhat routine in terms of story with a chaotic ending where you know what's going to happen, and I don't think everybody is going to get past the stereotypes, back then it would okay I think but now I think people will be shocked and rather sensitive to them. These aside, the animation is great, you always expect crisp backgrounds and clean colouring as well as character designs that are not too stiff, and Mickey's Mellerdrammer is no exception to this. The music again is wonderful, lively orchestrated and very energetic, this component has always been one of the best in these shorts and once again there is no problem at all. Mickey and Minnie have immense likability and their chemistry is genuinely sweet without being overly-so. Clarabelle is a pleasure to see as is Horace in an atypical villainous role, for someone who's always liked these two and consider them very underrated this was a real treat. The gags are what drive Mickey's Mellerdrammer and all of them are spot on, even the numerous ones in Clarabelle's fleeing through the rainstorm sequence when the whole scene goes by very fast. The firecracker, real dogs in fake dog costumes and the cat jumping on Clarabelle crossing the river on ice as well as being pursued by hounds sequences are hilarious. Overall, not everybody is going to be a fan, but I do really like it though I can see why people wouldn't. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

In the story, Little Eva is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner.  After Tom saves her from drowning, the owner buys him, but he is later sold to the evil Simon Legree.  In the cartoon, however, it starts off with Uncle Tom and Eva singing and dancing to \"Dixie.\"  Minnie shouts \"Oh look, it's Simon Legree!\"  In the real story, Eva did not know Simon at all.  Several fun gags were when Clarabelle is getting ready, she takes some soot out of the bottom of an oil lamp and rubs it on her face to make her look like an African American.  Mickey puts a firecracker in his mouth and it explodes in his face, making him look like a\nblack as well.  Whenever Horace walks on stage, the audience takes his role as Simon Legree too seriously and throw fruits and vegetables at him.  This is a great short for any Disney fan to watch. "

Avery's cartoons featuring Screwy Squirrel or the amorous Wolfie are hilarious, while his Droopy cartoons are complete garbage. 'I Wanna Be a Sailor' isn't as funny as Screwy Squirrel (very few cartoons are), but this cartoon has some solid laughs, a good story, and three interesting and distinctive characters.\n\nThe hero (if that's the proper word) is a little-boy parrot in a sailor hat, who wants to run off to sea and become a ship's parrot. His mother tries to dissuade him, and we see a very funny flashback of the boy parrot's father, a rum-soaked swabbie. (Great voice work by Elvia Allman as the mother parrot.) This being a Warners cartoon, of course the boy pays no heed to his elders and proceeds to head for the waterfront.\n\nMany of the early Warners cartoons had the delightful characteristic of being built round a song - the song's title also being the title of the cartoon - and these songs were invariably catchy and amusing. As the boy parrot heads for the water, he chants a catchy chantey called 'I Wanna Be a Sailor'. At the quayside, preparing to launch a raft, he meets a little-boy duck who wants to join him aboard. There's some great voice work here: the boy parrot has a very funny wise-guy vocal delivery, and the boy duck is even funnier ... spraying the parrot with rapid-fire questions.\n\nThe two bird-boys push off to sea, and straight away run into a storm. Suddenly the bounding main isn't quite so appealing, and the boy parrot calls for his mother ... who comes running, taking time out only to segue into a few bars of 'Old Black Joe'. The payoff gag is quite funny, although anyone familiar with Warner Brothers cartoons won't find it very surprising. I'll rate this delightful cartoon 10 out of 10, for kids and grown-ups to enjoy together. I wish Tex Avery had made more toons like this, instead of those unfunny Droopy epics.\n\n"

The little bird runs away from home, builds a ship and heads out on a lake with a baby duck but soon a storm rolls in. Here's another short that comes off a lot more cute than funny. I think the biggest problem I had with this one here is the simple fact that it didn't offer up too many laughs. The stuff on the sea with the parrot trying to be a sailor was mildly amusing but that's about as far as it went. The baby duck character was actually pretty good but sadly he didn't have too much to do."

The main plot is a trifle, as is appropriate for romantic comedy. Lederer plays a stage actor who accidentally kisses a stranger (Ida Lupino) in a darkened movie theater, when he thought he was kissing his married lover (billed as Countess Liev de Maigret). Lederer is prosecuted as a masher at the insistence of a public morality committee. At trial, he can't tell the true reason he kissed Lupino, so he says he was overcome by her beauty; the trial makes him a popular celebrity and his stage play a hit, and it starts a romance between Lederer and Lupino.\n\nLederer is a charming romantic lead and Lupino is radiant in an uncharacteristic early role as a sweet, innocent girl. Unfortunately, they have little chemistry between them, which is the weak point of the movie. But the supporting cast, including the always reliable Roland Young, Hugh Herbert, Donald Meek, Eric Rhodes, and Mischa Auer playing their usual characters, are all given either extended scenes or bits of business that keep the movie light, sparkling, and enjoyable. And Rowland Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard."

To protect Yvonne in the ensuing scandal, he claims that Monique's beauty was irresistible. Now Monique is intrigued, but her fianc\u00e9 is anything but happy,\" according to the fine folks at Mill Creek Entertainment.\n\nThis is a mostly unsuccessful romantic comedy from the intriguing production team of Mary Pickford and Jesse L. Lasky. She was, of course, THE film sweetheart last appearing in \"Secrets\" (1933) and he was the likewise legendary former Paramount Studios boss. \"One Rainy Afternoon\" was the first of two films from Pickford and Lasky, both starring Ida Lupino. The second was better, but they stopped there. Interestingly, you can see traces of Ms. Pickford in Ms. Lupino's character - these parts look like they might have appealed to Pickford herself. Leading man Francis Lederer receives star-billing, but is lesser remembered today; he was a versatile and convincing actor. Everyone delivers competent, albeit uninspired, work.\n\nInteresting, too, is that two of filmdom's very first popular players appear as uncredited extras. They are Florence Turner and Florence Lawrence, two of the movies' first genuine \"STAR\" actresses. Popular for several years, they were still big enough to appear in the first annual \"Motion Picture Story Magazine\" players poll, for 1912; Ms. Lawrence was #8, Ms. Turner was #11, and an up-and-coming Pickford appeared at #12. Pickford passed them in the next year's poll.\n\n**** One Rainy Afternoon (5/13/36) Rowland V. Lee ~ Francis Lederer, Ida Lupino, Hugh Herbert, Roland Young"

Her role in this one is short but important. However, the main intent of the movie is obviously to showcase Francis Lederer and to surround him with an equally talented cast headed by Ida Lupino, Hugh Herbert, Roland Young, Donald Meek, Erik Rhodes and Joseph Cawthorne. Personally, I feel we see a little too much of Mr. Herbert and that he way outdoes his trademark \"comic\" routines, but I guess you could make the same comment about the other character players as well. Although she has the main female role, I found it slightly annoying that director Roland V. Lee allowed her to be continually upstaged by the character players. This said, however, One Rainy Afternoon is a very agreeable movie with first-rate production values and above all, a sense of fun. Available on a very good Alpha DVD. Don't be put off by the lousy credit titles which seem to have been duped from a dupe of a dupe. The movie itself is very good condition."

I have no idea if the French film is any good or not, all I know is that \"One Rainy Afternoon\" became VERY tiresome almost as soon as it started! This is due to a terrible miscasting of Francis Lederer in a comedy--and his abilities with comedy were nonexistent. A fine actor, yes, but a comedian, no way! In addition, there is a lot of Hugh Herbert in the film and my theory about his films is that the more of him in a movie, the less I'll enjoy it. High laugh just pierces my brain and makes me want to scream.\n\nAs for the plot, it's VERY contrived and not enough to support an entire full-length film. Lederer is going to meet a married woman at the theater but instead of sitting there and kissing her in the dark, he accidentally kisses a stranger (Ida Lupino). What makes this so unendurable is everyone's reaction to this--like the world is about to end or something! To base an entire film on such a faux pas--what a mistake and the film comes off as very forced and unfunny.\n\nUPDATE: I saw this film again recently and think the original review a bit too severe. I now admit that the film, while seemingly endorsing sexual harassment, has some charm nevertheless."

This brisk, gloriously loopy, screwball comedy has more laughs than all three \"Austin Powers\" combined. It's sort of a \"Bringing Up Baby\"/\"After Hours\" hybrid with the male in this case (an infectiously optimistic Robert Young) the lovable screwball who turns the world into his own personal circus and everyone he meets into a clown - including gangsters, bus drivers, and of course, police desk sergeants. \n\nHe plays a fast-talking inventor whose ship finally comes in to the tune of $250,000 who is as generous with his fortune as many of us dream we would be were we in his shoes. His biggest challenge is a pretty travel agent he's just met (pretty Florence Rice, who has a Ginger Rogers quality about her) who admits that what she really wants to is to be married - presumably to her longtime fianc\u00e9 (a very young Hugh Marlowe) a bit of a stuffed shirt who has been told by his company that he'll only receive a big promotion - and thus become marriageable - if he can sell an insurance policy to an intractable local milkman. But Young is scheduled to set sail with and marry his snobbish longtime fianc\u00e9e (June Clayworth) first thing next morning, so he dedicates his last night as a bachelor to convincing the milkman to sign the insurance policy, enabling Marlowe and Rice to marry. But when Rice insists that she tag along to lend a hand, Marlowe's and Clayworth's nights become a living hell, and the movie ascends into screwball comedy heaven on the wings of kindred spirits Young and Rice.\n\nDirector Edwin Marin handles the material masterfully, and the two leads have marvelous chemistry, particularly in a brilliantly written scene where they are forced to hide from the cops in a cramped janitor's closet (\"Are your eyes really green or is that just the light?\" Young asks her) that crackles with sexual tension and reminds one of Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed sharing the phone in \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" \"Married Before Breakfast\" is a smart, very funny little gem that holds up extremely well 68 years after the fact."

In order to enjoy the film, you need to turn off your brain. Otherwise, you can't help but wonder why you're even watching the picture.\n\nThe film begins with Tom (Robert Young) demonstrating his latest invention to the board of a razor blade company. It's a lotion that dissolves beards--making shaving unnecessary. They decide to pay him $250,000 just so he WON'T market the cream.\n\nLater, at a dinner party thrown by Tom for his various friends, he gives them all expensive presents. It's nice to see that he's decided to share some of his wealth. However, what happens next makes no sense and makes the movie hard to endure. When a woman from the travel agency interrupts his party to bring him tickets for a honeymoon cruise, Tom INSISTS that he do something nice for the lady. She tells him that her fianc\u00e9 is trying to sell some milkman an insurance policy--and Tom leaves his party and ignores that he's supposed to be going to meet his new in-laws to-be--all in order to help a total stranger. However, selling the man on the policy ends up being very difficult and the pair spend the evening on all sorts of kooky adventures--including becoming mixed up a mob robbery, being chased by the police and more. At no point does Tom just give up and do what any sane man would do--and that is the biggest problem with the film. Suspension of disbelief is possible to a point. But when people behave irrationally again and again, it's really hard to stick with the film. Plus, who would imagine two people engaged to two other people spending all this time together?! Plus, in Hollywood clich\u00e9 tradition, you KNOW that by the end of the movie the mismatched pair will decide to marry instead--even though they know NOTHING about each other. Unless they both are insane or suffer from traumatic brain injuries, there's no accounting for this.\n\nIf it sounds like I didn't like the film, you are correct. I think Young was way too good for this material and the film went from being fun and quirky to just plain dumb. Not a particularly good film but despite this one of the reviewers said they wanted to see this film again and they were looking for a copy. Well, it is shown periodically on Turner Classic Movies--and I just saw it on this channel."

This 90 minute musical has everything you could ever hope for from a film.  Great songs, dancing, comedy, drama, suspense and Alice Faye!  The \"feud' between Ben Bernie and Walter Winchell (as real as the \"feud\" of Jack Benny and Fred Allen) inspired this film which takes place during the great days of live radio.\n\nBernie and Winchell are the main attractions here but Jack Haley, Alice Faye, Patsy Kelly and Ned Sparks are the real stars of this picture.  With the fine backing of Fox, this film was one in the long series of musicals featuring Faye and a stellar supporting cast.  It is in this film that she introduces the standard classic song, \"There's A Lull In My Life\".\n\nJack Haley is featured as a singer who suffers from mike fright.  Actually, Haley's wonderful singing voice is dubbed in this film by Buddy Clark!  For trivia fans, Haley refers to this role in his next picture, \"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm\", when he lets a young girl who is afraid of microphones know that he was once afraid of them too.\n\nThe film is a timepiece of an era long gone.  If you ever get the chance to see this great film with all of its wonderful songs, \"It's Swell Of You\",\"Wake Up And Live\" and, \"Never In A Million Years\", you won't be mislead."

                "text": "\nWalter Winchell started in vaudeville as a performer in Gus Edwards's 'School Days' act. (A fictionalised version of this remarkable troupe became Bing Crosby's movie 'The Star Maker'.) Between engagements, Winchell wrote and published a vaudeville newsletter, filled with showbiz gossip. He eventually became a newspaper/radio columnist, utterly ruthless in his power, quick to destroy an enemy's career and (less frequently) to aid a friend. (The Broadway revue 'Hellzapoppin' was trashed by all the critics, yet ran for more than 3 years because Winchell plugged it in his column every single day.) Although many actors and entertainers desperately coveted a mention in Winchell's column, nearly everyone in show business despised him.  (Ed Sullivan once threatened to shove Winchell's head into a toilet.) Winchell wisely avoided feuding with his many enemies, aware that such action would only give them free publicity. One of Winchell's few real friends was popular radio bandleader Ben Bernie, and the two concocted a public 'feud' that was a long-running publicity stunt for them both. Several movies - most notably 'Sweet Smell of Success' and 'Blessed Event' - feature fictional journalists who are blatantly based upon Winchell.\n\n'Wake Up and Live', an above-average Fox musical, features Winchell and Bernie playing themselves ... or, rather, fictionalised versions of themselves, designed to make Winchell look good and their phony feud look genuine. In a staged scene, Winchell rattles off his extensive knowledge of obscure nightclub acts while identifying a masked singer after hearing only a few notes. In another scene - equally staged, but funny - a shifty promoter played by Walter Catlett tries to offer Winchell a bribe. Winchell takes the money but immediately drops it into a charity poorbox. Catlett attempts to retrieve the cash, only to attract the interest of a passing policeman. This scene pays tribute to one of Winchell's few genuine redeeming traits: he was active for many charitable causes. (Winchell founded the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund.) It's fascinating to see Winchell onscreen, even though he's clearing playing a sanitised version of himself. To see him here, you'd never guess he bullied his daughter unmercifully and drove his son to suicide.\n\nAlthough Winchell and Bernie are prominently featured, the frothy plotline centres on Jack Haley as a would-be radio vocalist and Alice Faye as the singer who encourages him. The sexy and vivacious Faye sings the bouncy title tune. There's a very funny scene in which Haley arrives at the radio station, hoping to audition, when he runs afoul of a sour-tempered studio usher. The usher is played by none other than William Demarest, in his usual mode. It's astonishing to realise that, as late as 1937, Demarest was still playing bit parts like this one ... still, he's very welcome here in his brief scene. Demarest assures Haley that his audition will go well, providing he doesn't get mike fright ... a phenomenon which he then describes to Haley. So, of course, as soon as Haley tries to sing he develops mike fright. There's a delightfully surrealistic sequence in which we see the microphone from Haley's viewpoint, as it morphs into a snarling demon!\n\nThere are some lively but irrelevant speciality acts, including a couple of dance routines that would never perform on an actual radio show. Lots of familiar faces in the cast list, and Patsy Kelly is less annoying than usual. The title song is the only good one here. One interesting trivia note: the opening credits of this movie feature two guys from the art department named Mark-Lee Kirk and Haldane Douglas, and their names are stacked onscreen so that 'Kirk' is directly above 'Douglas'. I wonder if a certain dimple-chinned actor, just aspiring to a film career at this point, took his screen name from the credits of this movie? I'll rate 'Wake Up and Live' 9 points out of 10."

                "text": "One of Darryl F. Zanuck's peculiar quirks was that he frowned upon his musical stars making records. Unlike Bing Crosby who recorded nearly all the songs he sang in Paramount films and numbers from other Paramount films with the encouragement of Adolph Zukor, Zanuck felt that if the public bought records they wouldn't pay to see his films. Alice Faye did manage to record about 20 sides during the Thirties and the last batch she did was four songs from Wake Up And Live. Good thing to because Mack Gordon and Harry Revel wrote some of their best material for this film.\n\nThe film itself was based on a make believe radio feud between columnist Walter Winchell and band-leader Ben Bernie who play themselves on screen. Make believe feuds among radio personalities was a common enough thing back in the day, it made for interesting programming and bigger Hooper ratings. The Hooper was the radio equivalent of the Nielsen before television became commercial.\n\nJack Haley and Grace Bradley are a pair of vaudevillians who travel to New York hoping to cash in on the fact that Haley's sister Patsy Kelly is Walter Winchell's assistant. A mention in Winchell's column gets them inundated with offers, but Haley who apparently has no problem performing before a live audience of a hundred or so in a theater, gets paralyzed with fear over speaking and singing into a microphone that will broadcast to millions.\n\nBut one night when Alice Faye is singing on Ben Bernie's program, Haley is in an empty studio singing into what he thinks is a dead mike. His voice comes over the air and no one knows who it is. Immediately he's dubbed 'The Phantom Troubadour' and the hunt is on to find him. It's a contest between Winchell, Bernie, and a bottom feeding sleaze-bag agent played by Walter Catlett. Of course Faye finds out first and looks to exploit Haley in her own way.\n\nIt's a nonsensical plot, from an era that spawned this kind of nonsense. Doesn't detract a whit from the fact it's an entertaining film with Alice Faye singing at her very best.\n\nBut you won't hear the familiar voice of Jack Haley that you know as the Tinman from The Wizard of Oz. Instead Haley's voice in this film is dubbed by one of the great radio crooners of the time, Buddy Clark. Buddy never did too much work before the camera, but on radio he was one of the most popular singers in his era. Sadly he was killed in a plane crash right before the era of television, I'm sure he would have made it big there.\n\nAlice and Buddy get to sing the title song, Never In A Million Years and Swell Of You. Alice does There's A Lull In My Life and Buddy sings Ooh, But I'm Happy. \n\nLong before I finally got to see Wake Up And Live I had a long playing 33 1/3 vinyl album of Alice Faye with the four songs she sings before Zanuck put an end to her recording career. I knew the songs and loved them. So it was a special treat for me to finally see the film and more so to hear Buddy Clark sing as well even if the words came out of Jack Haley's mouth.\n\nI think if you can ever catch Wake Up And Live you will feel as I do about the great singing voice of Buddy Clark."

He gets hired on as a guide there, and one day sings into a mike, not realizing that his vocals are going out live on the air. He has a great voice and is an immediate sensation, but since no one knows who did the singing, he becomes famous as the \"Phantom Troubadour\". Meanwhile, he meets a beautiful female singer (Alice Faye) whose radio show \"Wake Up and Live\" has just been canned by the network for lack of jokes. She decides to help him get over his mike fright - by having him come to her place each day to \"practice\" singing into a microphone, which unknown to him is putting his voice out live on the air every day! \n\nWith enjoyable, catchy songs (particularly the title song), a couple of fabulous tab dance numbers, Alice Faye looking absolutely gorgeous on the big screen, funny and likable Jack Haley, plus a fantastic looking print shown at a screening at Cinecon 43 in Hollywood, this film proved to be a real winner and a treat to see. A subplot in this film involves a feud between real life personalities Walter Winchell and orchestra leader, Ben Bernie, who appear as themselves. Character actors Patsy Kelly and especially Ned Sparks (who is hilarious here) add a touch of humor to the mix. A very entertaining film."

Some of those traits are evident in this musical-comedy piffle about the Walter Winchell-Ben Bernie feud, but there are compensating pleasures. High among them is Alice Faye warbling good Gordon-Revel songs such as \"There's a Lull in My Life\" (a surprisingly boring arrangement of it, though, and she's unflatteringly gowned); also, a genuinely funny second couple in Patsy Kelly and Ned Sparks; also, a specialty dance by Joan Davis. Jack Haley's an adequate leading man, though not a particularly charismatic one, and, since the plot turns on his golden voice, his songs are dubbed by Buddy Clark. (Haley could sing, but not well enough to be a \"phantom troubadour.\") It's brisk and reasonably comical, the musical numbers are fine, and the production bloat that hobbled so many Fox musicals over the next decade is nowhere evident."

The songs, the acting, the singing, the comedy, the machine gun musical numbers fired at the audience one after the other...all winners. Talent, talent, talent to a breathtaking level which ends in such a rousing way, one has no alternative but to cheer.\n\n\"Old movies used to make people feel good\"......no movie proves the truth of this oft stated bromide than Wake Up And Live (1937).\n\nWalter Winchell got top billing for the movie...higher billing than the actual main characters played by Jack Hailey and Alice Faye.\n\nWinchell was wonderful beyond words, and is true proof that movie stars are never made, trained, or created....they were already there when some smart movie producer put a camera in front of them and \"let them do their thing.\"\n\nWhen the movie camera can and does photograph charisma (with or without the help of microphones and sound recording), a movie star is born, and revealed.\n\nWalter Winchell was a natural movie star. He acted in vaudeville before he became a journalist celebrity, and was aware from actual experience as a paid performing artist of the problems and dilemmas actors faced. He didn't have to face those problems in the newspaper business. He moved from acting to writing, but always had the natural movie star actor ability we see shine brilliantly in Wake Up And Live (1937).\n\nWinchell has such charisma and is such a natural before the camera (he plays himself.....I don't think he ever did another movie, or at least not one like this where he was center stage so often, and wonderful every second of the time), there's no way to say how good he was. You gotta see him in Wake Up And Live (1937).\n\nAlice Faye (1915 - 1998), the female lead star of the movie proves color film isn't needed to show of the most incredible and hypnotizing blue eyes ever to appear in cinema at any time. She is so beautiful, and her eyes especially in the movie's abundant close-ups of her wonderful face, the viewer can't help being enchanted.\n\nWake Up And Live (1937) is wonderful for many reasons....the set decoration is packed with art deco night club scenes better than most big Fred Astaire movies.\n\nSupporting actors and character actors of fame abound in Wake Up And Live (1937). Walter Catlett, Ned Sparks, William Demarest, Patsy Kelly, and Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson....and on and on and on.......\n\nThe movie (and every main character in it) has style and \u00e9lan and charm and pizazz to a level seldom, maybe never reached before nor since......it showed the 1930's classy night club scene and brassy characters part of it all at its very best and most compelling.\n\nWAKE UP AND LIVE (1937) is a \"Walter Winchell Theme Movie,\" one of several worth seeing.\n\nTwo \"Winchell theme movies\" were made in 1932 (OKAY America and also BLESSED EVENT) when Walter Winchell was VERY important in the show biz world. He was a \"wordsmith\" of renown and enormous talent, and a showman extraordinaire.....his career went non-stop from the 20's until his death in the 70's. He was always thought important, and for good reason.\n\nThe high quality of the actor cast in OKAY America (1932) shows the investment big shots in Hollywood thought worth making in a movie about Walter Winchell.....Lew Ayres, Maureen O'Sullivan, Louis Callhern, others. Lew Ayres was slower and less charismatic than Walter Winchell or Lee Tracy playing a Winchell type in BLESSED EVENT the same year. Reviewers complain about this, but never forget what an important actor Lew Ayres was in 1932 (he had had just starred in the biggest movie of those times, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT). Anything Lew Ayres did was and is worth seeing. OKAY America (1932) is \"OK!\" so ignore the critics and see the movie anyway.\n\nThis is a quality movie, one of a group all based on the Walter Winchell character and phenomenon.\n\nOver movie history, \"Walter Winchell\" type \"theme movies\" (the world of gossip column \"tell all\" newspaper reporters) were made, most of them well done because the subject (Winchell and his dramatic ways) is inherently dynamic, fast moving, and interesting.\n\nBLESSED EVENT (1932 starring Lee Tracy appeared the same year as OKAY America (1932), and was based on a Broadway play from 1932 which dealt with \"the world of Winchell\" (without naming him directly).\n\nWinchell himself appeared in WAKE UP AND LIVE (1937 Fox) playing himself \"doing his thing\" and the movie is wonderful, but also, mysteriously, hard to get, not ranked among the \"great\" 30's musicals, which it certainly was and is.\n\nSWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957)starring Burt Lancaster was an anti-Winchell movie (Lancaster played Winchell as a villain, while the earlier Winchell movies presented the \"Winchell type as sympathetic and positive).\n\nHowever, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957) but clearly a re-affirmation that Winchell was always interesting, always news for decades! Gathering various \"Winchell theme movies\" is worth doing. These movies are all good! \n\n--------------------------"

                "text": "In \"The Wizard of Oz\", Tin Man Jack Haley was searching for his heart, but in this earlier 20th Century Fox musical, he found himself searching for courage, afraid of a big metal box that could have been melted down to make the Tin Man's hat. He's billed way below a bunch of top stars, but really is the lead, a milquetoast radio station page who has a crush on radio singer Alice Faye but goes numb as he tries to face his fears of singing. One day by accident, he tries to get over his fear and sings into what he believes to be a dead microphone but which actually goes live on the air as bandleader Ben Bernie plays. Pretty soon, Bernie's hated rival, Walter Winchell, is forcing Bernie (a real-life bandleader) to come up with what he has named as \"the Phantom Crooner\", with all but Faye unaware that Haley is singing into what he believes to be just a rehearsal session. That includes Winchell's wise-cracking secretary Patsy Kelly (who happens to be Haley's sister) and Kelly's vinegary voiced boyfriend (grouchy Ned Sparks), providing a lot of laughs and plenty of fun big band late 1930's music.\n\nPlenty of insults fly around the room as Winchell and Bernie (the top-billed stars) go at each other-Winchell in his column and Bernie on the air. Like Jack Benny and Fred Allen, theirs is an obviously made up feud, and really, you can't help but realize that they actually worship the quicksand that the other one walks on. Having just played Haley's wife in the college football musical \"Pigskin Parade\", Kelly is very funny, while future star Joan Davis proves herself to be a very funny girl as she plays a knocked about Spanish dancer (!) in an amusing comedy dance sequence. Haley is actually dubbed by Buddy Clark, but it took some research for me to prove that. Haley had sung in musicals before, but something in his voice was very different, even if the crooner style is obviously not him, the sound is quite similar. \"Never in a Million Years\" is a very pretty ballad, but was overshadowed by Faye's big solo, \"There's a Lull in My Life\", a very blues style number that was part of her transition from brassy blonde bombshell to gentle leading lady.\n\nA hysterical group of character actors add even more laughs, with Walter Catlett part of the unbelieving Winchell team, and Etienne Girardot (the religious nut from \"Twentieth Century\" and Edward G. Robinson's miniature imperious boss from \"The Whole Town's Talking\") very funny as the man sitting next to Haley during a radio show whom Haley incorrectly assumes to be the phantom crooner. Barnett Parker is hysterically funny leading the radio show audience in a chorus where Haley's \"phantom crooner\" voice is heard in the radio station's office and leads to the confusion concerning Girardot. An above average song score by Mack Revel and Harry Gordon makes this a must for classic movie fans. There will be no time for napping once this comedy gem gets going, so waking up isn't an option."

He goes from being suave and successful, to maudlin and manic. A modern psychologist would have a field day. The tension that builds as he goes through his rant is a little like Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining.\" There's a moment where the bride becomes cognizant of the fact that she is married to a lunatic. And, of course, she had been warned and has married him anyway. Anyway, the last scene where they spar intellectually is delightful and shows both actors at their best. There's a wonderful moment of realization on the young woman's face where she realizes that her life depends on what she says. It is one of the most claustrophobic bits I've ever seen and is very effective in showing that there is just a little tilt to the scales on both sides."

                "summary": "Basil the Fortune Hunter",
                "text": "Agatha Christie had a hard time with the movie adaptations of her works. Prior to the astounding success of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS in the 1970s, only two film adaptations of her works had been done well: the 1944 version of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, and (beyond that) the 1957 version of WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. The former was done by the French film director Rene Clair, and the latter by Billy Wilder, and both were well cast. But those were like exceptions to the general rule. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION had a memorable performance of Charles Laughton as the cagey old barrister Sir Wilfred Robarts (ably assisted by his nurse, played by Laughton's wife Elsa Lanchester). But in the early 1930s an early English talkie was made of ALIBI, a play based on THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD. Laughton had made a name for himself on stage as Hercule Poirot in that play, and was repeating the role for film. Christie saw the finished result and wondered if she should allow her other stories to be made into movies! In 1937 Christie allowed a play she wrote, \"Philomel Cottage\" to be made into a film. The film was retitled LOVE FROM A STRANGER, and starred Ann Harding as a lonely young woman who wins a fortune in a lottery. Soon she meets a fascinating, sophisticated gentleman played by Basil Rathbone, who sweeps her off her feet and marries her. But his charms begin to frazzle after marriage - he insists on them moving to the cottage (of the play's title) which is in an out-of-the-way location, and he slowly drives away all her friends. As she realizes how isolated she is, she begins to wonder what is the real personality of the man she has married: is he moody or is he actually planning to murder her for her money.\n\nAlthough not handled by a director of the caliber of Clair or Wilder (or of ORIENT EXPRESS' Sidney Lumet), LOVE FROM A STRANGER benefited from the hand of Rowland Lee, an expert director of melodrama and detective films. Lee wisely kept to the story, and allowed Rathbone to play one of his best villains. Basil is a fortune hunter and \"Bluebeard\" like Henri Landru or George Joseph Smith. He has more polish than the average killer: witness his abilities to order a first rate dinner early in the film for Harding and himself, including choosing the fine wine involved. He also is quite in love with his accomplishments. When the neighborhood doctor and he are discussing murder cases the former mentions one in South America where the killer defended himself and got off, and left the jurisdiction just before the evidence that would have convicted him turned up. Rathbone says that killer was brilliant, and was really something else. Of course, as it turns out, that killer was Rathbone.\n\nHarding balances him, trying to keep her suspicions under control and trying to counter all of Rathbone's various schemes so that she can stay alive. It becomes a literal battle to the death between the two of them.\n\nLOVE FROM A STRANGER lacks the production values of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, but it has two sturdy performances and good directing behind it. It is the best of the pre-1944 Christie films. In 1947 it would be remade (with the same title) with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney and John Howard, although no longer treated as a modern story but set back in the 1890s.\n\nOne final point. The supporting cast included David Calthrop (who frequently was in British movies in this period), and Jean Cadell. But one name in the cast is rather ironic. Joan Hickson had an early role in this film. In the 1980s the B.B.C. discovered in Ms Hickson the first woman to play the role of Miss Jane Marple (pace Margaret Rutherford and Angela Lansbury) as Christie had written the role. Hickson would appear in nearly a dozen small screen multi-episode productions in the 1980s and 1990s before her death in 1998. Her performances as Miss Marple remain a standard to match all others in that role."

Most of all, it's worth seeing for the terrifying performance by Basil Rathbone, which again reminds us what an accomplished and versatile actor was all-but obliterated in his later absorption into Sherlock Holmes.  No goalie-mask, no retractile steel claws, no camera-tricks, he scares the pants off you using only an actor's equipment, and you'll never forget his portrayal of a psychotic, obsessive Bluebeard."

Basil Rathbone relishes his role as the suave murderer and the latter stages of the film allow him to go into all-out hysterics in much the same way (and under the same director!) as he would, memorably, in SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939); in fact, the last 15 minutes create a genuinely electrifying tension that are basically the film's raison d'etre.\n\nRowland V. Lee has perhaps never been a highly regarded film-maker but, from what little I've seen of his work, he was a reasonably efficient craftsman and, given promising material, he always turned in a quality product (the two films of his I would most love to catch up with are the definitive screen version of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO [1934] and TOWER OF London [1939], yet another Rathbone collaboration)."

He skillfully avoids the pitfalls of overacting which might normally come to an actor not possessed of Rathbone's talents.\n\nBy the time the film is nearly over we are at a nerve-breaking tension; the powerful final scene when Carol (Ann Harding) realizes what her husband is about to do,and tricks him into believing she has poisoned his coffee, is quite gripping. The only weak point in the film is that it seems hard to believe, given the temperament of Gerald Lovell (Rathbone), that he would simply die of fright.\n\nThe supporting cast gives solid performances, and it's of interest to see Joan Hickson, who would gain fame as Miss Marple five decades later, playing Emmy the maid. This film was remade in Hollywood in 1947, and TV versions of it include 1938, 1947, 1958 (all BBC) and 1967 (in Germany).\n\nNote: Frank Vosper, the actor and playwright who starred in Love From a Stranger on stage in 1936 (and whose adaptation of the story has been used for all the film and TV based on the Christie work-originally called Philomel Cottage) died mysteriously in 1937, when he either jumped, fell, or was pushed off a transatlantic liner.

This film does take its time to get going, with the beginning moving rather slowly, and Bruce Seton is wooden. But there is so much to like about Love from a Stranger. The production values, from the period detail to the photography, is very pleasing to look at, and Benjamin Britten's(only 23/24 at the time) score has a haunting undercurrent as well as stylistically distinctive. The dialogue is snappy and adds intensity rather than falling too much into stodgy melodrama. And the storytelling is far more convincing, the middle is suspenseful, helped by a far more convincing exploration of the psychological and psychopathic aspects of the characters and story, and the somewhat ironic ending is very tense. In the later version, the ending was ridiculously done and what was suspenseful here was undermined by overwrought melodrama and real stodginess. Director Ronald V. Lee sets things up with a smooth and neat approach, and the cast are top notch, Joan Hickson and Binnie Hale stand out in support. But it's the leads who carry with a classy and dignified Ann Harding and a genuinely menacing Basil Rathbone. Overall, a very good film that starts slowly but rewarding once you stay with it. Comparing this with the later version with Sylvia Sidney and John Hodiak, there is no doubt that it's this one that is the far superior film version. 8/10 Bethany"

Rathbone has been praised (and rightly so) in other reviews: for an actor best known as the swift-quipping villainous fencing master of the swashbuckler genre, or the alert and cerebral Sherlock Holmes, he puts on an astonishing act here as a charismatic seducer, while his theatrical training is clearly to the fore when he carries off his set-piece speeches about moonlight over the Taj Mahal... and manages to make them sound compelling instead of merely false. (Miss Harding doesn't manage quite so well when it comes to her turn with the same lines; but then her character is supposed to be merely parroting his.) \n\nBinnie Hale, meanwhile -- darling of the West End musical comedy stage throughout the 1920s -- here plays the heroine's unmarried flatmate (frankly, I was hoping by the end that the rejected suitor would find solace in the arms of plain good-hearted Kate) as more or less a 'straight' role, but manages to liven every scene she is in with her tremendous energy and sense of timing. It is not on the face of it much of a part, but Miss Hale makes a good deal out of it and brings the character sympathetically to life.\n\nBruce Seton puts in a rather wooden performance as the admittedly somewhat one-dimensional Ronnie (one of Agatha Christie's standard hearty-but-dim stalwart Englishmen), which does the film no favours; and I felt that an otherwise excellent script, which makes matters apparent without ever explicitly stating them, would have benefited from a little more ambiguity. Rathbone's performance is so good that it seems a pity to make him an obvious villain from so early on, while it makes the heroine seem a fool for failing to see it -- a missed opportunity perhaps for leaving the audience wondering about Gerald's sincerity until a much later point.\n\nMiss Harding is not quite up to the standard of her supporting players when it comes to dealing with this sort of material (compare her cutaway 'reaction shots' to those of Rathbone and Miss Hale -- but then to Seton!) and her character comes across at times as somewhat one-note in moments of stress; when Gerald rages at her for entering the cellar, for example, the actress goes immediately into 'maximum shock' mode and stays there. But on the whole she holds her own in a demanding part which requires her to appear in almost every scene, and creates real chemistry with just about every character the heroine interacts with, from the half-wit rustic Emmy to the hypochondriac Aunt Lou, and of course the two men with whom she is seen to be in love. (And keep a look out for those classic 1930s costumes -- especially the demure but at times extremely revealing evening dress of the final scene!)"

I believe we are seeing *some* radical rethinking, because with 3D and CGI, we get a less encumbered camera, one whose normal stance is eye height of a human ghost, anchored to the Earth.\n\nIn other comments, I have noted how this evolution is developing, even in the safest blockbusters. This by itself is a more fundamental shift in our world than nearly everything because it changes how we dream and love. But I was hoping for something more fluid in what realities we see, like *Birdman,* but for film, not stage.\n\nThe film world had a similar period where new technology challenged us to devise a new narrative vocabulary. For better or worse, our present stories evolved in the great experimental period from, say 1929 to 1941 (Citizen Kane). So rattling around in that period, one sees a much greater variety than we have today. Some of the experimental models stuck around for another ten.\n\nMany of these are like this film \u0097 a play designed to only engage in the last few moments. This is a bit hard for modern viewers to watch, because there is the barest work to engage. We only have enough (enough for the period) to keep us in our seats.

                "text": "Beautiful Ann Harding was noted for her long silvery blonde hair and her melodious throbbing voice. Her looks and bearing meant she was only to play ladies and she played them to perfection but by the mid 1930s she was being ousted by stars who could play more down to earth heroines. Like many other stars whose box office power had dimmed she tried her luck in England and made \"Love From a Stranger\" in 1937. It was taken from an Agatha Christie short story and had a ripping, over the top performance by Basil Rathbone. Some of the critics of the day compared the shocking ending to James Cagney's ending in \"The Public Enemy\" (1931) - not quite!!\n\nAnn Harding at her most dignified was completely believable as English working girl Carol who finds she has won the lottery. She goes on a \"wild\" spending spree (she buys a hat she has had her eye on) and eagerly awaits the return of Ronnie (Bruce Seton), her fianc\u00e9, old \"Mr. Reliable\", who she hasn't seen for a few years (he has been working in the Sudan, saving for their marriage). Before he arrives she meets Gerald Lovell (Basil Rathbone) who has come to view her flat which she is going to let. Once Ronnie arrives and realises she has won the lottery - suddenly the thought of marriage turns him cold. He wants to be the man of the house, support them both on his salary etc, but Carol wants them both to travel to exotic lands, to places new and interesting. They quarrel and suddenly Gerald is back on the scene and Carol finds it hard to resist him. He follows her to Paris - where she has to pick up her winnings - and proceeds to show her the Paris he knows - all the out of the way places. Ronnie then turns up, he is sorry for the way he has behaved, but she has news for him - she is already married.\n\nThings, at first, seem wonderful but then a house deal falls through and Gerald's South American bank funds are late - he is more than happy for Carol to sign some papers. He has an evil glint in his eye - is she signing away her fortune??? They move into a beautiful country house but as in all these movies - the cellar is the master's domain and no one is to go down there but him!!! He gives Carol a beautiful scarf - and it starts to affect his mind. His behaviour becomes more and more erratic - he literally screams when he finds her near his \"dark room\", when the doctor examines him and when Carol's old friends come to visit. The screams are really bloodcurdling!!! He is particularly interested in \"Fletcher\", a master criminal who has murdered three women and successfully evaded the police. When he sees Carol looking at Fletcher's picture again - she realises not only is he mad but he is also Fletcher. \n\nThe ending is tension filled but with a few holes. Lovell is supposed to have a heart condition - but can no one see he is stark raving mad!! There is a fine line between Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes and the madness of Gerald Lovell. Ann Harding gives a gripping performance as the lovely Carol who, in a huge surprise twist, turns the tables on Gerald - and wins. This could be Ann's best performance.\n\nHighly Recommended."

He spends an inordinate amount of time in his cellar, enjoying his photography hobby, and nobody else is allowed inside. The viewer is awarded the chance to see a normally stern and sedate Rathbone going off the rails, although the rest of the production has dated somewhat and the female protagonist's character is quite poorly written.

That reference in the story didn't go very far, but putting the future Sherlock Holmes on the opposite side of the law seemed oddly satisfactory.\n\nActually, Ann Harding has top billing in bold letters over Rathbone in the opening credits, and it IS pretty much her picture throughout until about the last half hour when Rathbone summons up his maniacal best. Personally, I would have been suspicious of him on the cruise ship when he offered Miss Howard (Harding) and Kate (Binnie Hall) a tray of hot chocolate, whipped cream, French pastry and pilchard sardines.\n\nConsidering the tension in the build up to the finale, I thought the story had a pretty good mix of humor going for it. I would liked to have seen more of hypochondriac Aunt Lou, she seemed like quite the trip with her floating pains. And dim-witted English house maid Emmy (Joan Hickson) raised my eyebrows with a remark to Carol about her prospects for getting married, considering she 'ain't quite bright but I'm willing'. A bit of double entendre there.\n\nActually, two key elements of the story can be interpreted in different ways, and since I haven't read the Agatha Christie short story this was based on, I don't know the definitive result. Presumably, the character 'Fletcher' was actually Gerald Lovell (Rathbone), but if you think about it, the criminal might have only been the inspiration for Lovell's madness. I tried mentally erasing the scruffy beard on the picture of Fletcher, and it didn't strike me that the resemblance to Lovell was there.\n\nSecondly, the verbal sparring between Carol and Lovell was explained as buying time for the poison in the coffee to kick in. However considerable pains were taken to establish Lovell's heart condition, so Carol's pressing of the argument could have been taken as providing the stress to cause a massive heart attack. Otherwise, guess what? - she's a murderer! How come no one else has considered that in the dozen plus other reviews posted on this board?"

                "text": "\n'Scampolo, a Child of the Street' is a starring vehicle for Dolly Haas, an actress specialising in 'waif' and 'gamin' roles, whom I've slagged quite thoroughly in a couple of other IMDb reviews. I find Haas intensely annoying; she does all sorts of little bits of physical business (quivering lips, eyes brimming with tears that don't quite come) that are supposed to just melt our hearts, but which make me want to give her a boot in the snoot. The German-born Haas reminds me of the Italian actress Giulietta Masina, and that's not a compliment to either: they played similar roles, and both had the same annoying bag of 'cute' tricks. Also, both actresses are made even more annoying by the fact that they tend to give their twee performances in films with implausible plotlines.\n\n'Scampolo, ein Kind der Stra\u00dfe' is less mawkish than usual for Haas, for two reasons. Firstly, for possibly the only time in her career, she actually gives a restrained performance. I'll credit this to director Hans Steinhoff: this film was his only collaboration with Haas. (Steinhoff, a member of the Nazi party, would soon devote his considerable talents to films in the service of the Third Reich. He died in a 'plane crash on Hitler's last birthday, in the final weeks of WW2.)\n\nThe other factor that makes this film superior to Haas's usual efforts is that (more so than usual) the story is plausible, and it actually depicts conditions as they prevailed in Germany shortly before the beginning of the Reich. There's a whiff of Mills & Boon about several of Dolly Haas's films, but this one shows the poverty, inflation and homelessness that were rampant in Germany just before Hitler's chancellorship (and which helped bring him to power).\n\nHaas plays a waif, as usual, this time named Scampolo ... which sounds more like a name for an Italian boy than a German fraulein. Like a lot of other residents of Berlin at this time, Scampolo has nowhere to live, and must sleep rough. (I found these scenes far more realistic than I expected.) She does have a very low-paying job, doing menial tasks for a laundress (Hedwig Bliebtreu).\n\nEventually, Dolly meets handsome Karl Diehl. In most Haas films, the leading man is either openly a millionaire or somebody who turns out to be secretly a millionaire. Here, Diehl plays an Englishman: a respectable bank manager who is nonetheless skint because he lost his job and all his money when his bank failed. (Very plausible, this: many European banks were ruined by the 1929 Wall Street crash.) However, so many of Haas's films are so far into fairytale fantasy that I couldn't quite believe this. I assumed that Diehl's banker would turn out to be a wealthy man who was *pretending* to be impoverished, so as to see if Dolly's love is sincere.\n\nSPOILERS NOW. Nope; turns out Diehl was broke after all ... but this is a Dolly Haas movie, so the last reel sees his fortunes restored and he and Dolly fly off to London to get married. (This being 1932, they don't seem to realise they're also getting out of Germany just in time.)\n\nI am certainly no fan of Dolly Haas, but I found this film much more tolerable than usual for her.  There is a welcome amount of cynicism in the dialogue and the onscreen situations. As Billy Wilder gets a script credit, I can guess where that cynicism came from. I'll rate 'Scampolo' 6 points out of 10.\n"

Down the road, he sees a poster outside a theater of Betty Boop. so he goes inside to investigate. Hey, it looks better than that opera.\n\nThis little king is really a cool guy. In the theater, a vendor is selling pretzels. The king buys all of them and then distributes them free to the other people. Betty starts her show, rides a horse around a small ring a few times (Bronco Betty?) and the kings goes on-stage and asks if he can ride the horse. He's a little rough with the horse, but then changes positions and lets the horse ride him!! (This is kind of a strange story, to be honest.)\n\nMeanwhile, the crabby queen finally notices the king is gone from the opera house and goes to get him. And - talk about strange - you should see the ending!"

He ends up falling for Betty but his wife isn't going to let that happen. I guess some would attack me for saying this but I really didn't find The Little King character to be all that entertaining. The film gets off to a pretty good start with the King seeing a man selling pretzels so he decides to buy all of them up so that he can sell them himself. Sadly this is where the entertainment stopped as we see the King getting into all sorts of trouble and of course he eventually runs into Betty. Fleischer and company were clearly using this short to try and sell The Little King character onto people but overall I just don't think the film worked very well. The King just isn't interesting enough to take any of the spotlight away from Betty and another problem is that there's really no funny material here. As you'd expect, the animation is top-notch as usual and Boop is as cute as ever but this here just isn't enough to really sell the movie."

So he goes further down the street (where we see the wonderful tabletop 3-D backgrounds the Fleischers were starting to use at this time) to see Ms. Boop in a cowgirl outfit with horse in tow. In no time at all, the king sells pretzels and performs with Betty and the horse. I'll stop there and say how funny and entertaining this animated short was.

As I remember it, there was little or no dialog, much like HENRY.\n\nLike most other popular features in the \"funny papers\", it was sought after for adaptation, and was done so by another studio, and possibly by Hearst's Metro Films as a silent Cartoon.\n\nThe \"cute\", round little monarch of this still un-named Kingdom, with the Margaret DuMont type of Queen was tapped by Max & Dave Fleischer to be one of a number of characters that their own Cartoon Star, Betty Boop, would have as a co-star in one of her pictures. (The series, by the way, featured other characters which were published and copyrighted by Hearst/King Features, like for example, the previously mentioned HENRY and even from Elzie C. Seegar's THIMBLE THEATRE Comic Strip, POPEYE THE SAILOR MAN!* The Cartoon \"BETTY AND THE LITTLE KING\" features the King out for the night with his wife the Queen, when the Little King becomes bored with the Opera and sneaks out and down the street to a Vaudiville Playhouse, where he peddles some pretzels! (Displaying the most pitiful voice you can imagine, sort of like a cross between Elmer Fudd and Truman Capote!) He eventually hooks up with Miss Betty Boop, dancing, singing and doing a little Rope Skipping on Stage.\n\nAfter a while, the dowager Queen misses L.K. and all the King's horses and all the King's men are out looking for him.Once found, the little hen-pecked Sovreign is returned to the Royal Coach, and rides off with the Queen! But Betty Boop is riding outside on the under-carriage, and is holding his hand! Well now, we've all heard about the carryings-on of these Royalty People! Having different characters from the Pages of Hearst's Comic Pages was a way that the Fleischers had in trying out new properties for their cartoon shorts. The only real success was in Segar's POPEYE, which along with Fleischer's 1940's SUPERMAN Series proved to be the backbone of their Studio's output. Pity, they owned the rights to neither POPEYE nor SUPERMAN.\n\nThat would have put them on really steady ground and right up there with people like Disney, instead of getting Aced out of the Studio by the Paramount gang."

Well, the queen was enjoying it while the king was bored out of his mind. He occasionally licked his candy cane sword. Soon he decided he had enough of the opera and, while the queen and the royal body guards weren't looking, the king ducked out of the theater. While going for a stroll down town, the king walks by the local Vaudeville theater and sees an ad for Betty Boop in a wild west show. The king thought it sounded swell so he went in. He saw a vendor selling pretzels, and since this king loved doing anything he saw his subjects doing, he bought all the pretzels from the vendor and began distributing them himself. Soon the show began. Betty and her horse rode around the stage. The king was astonished and wanted to go up on stage and ride Betty's horse. He had a great time. But back at the opera house, the queen finally noticed the king was gone. The royal bodyguards searched high and low. Back at the Vaudeville theater, the king was having a great time being part of Betty's act. She, the king, and the horse were jumping rope. Just then, in came the furious queen who grabbed her king by the nose and dragged him out of the theater. But fortunately the king would not be leaving empty handed. Literally. For he on the way back to the opera house, he had Betty in tow.\n\nThis is another Betty Boop cartoon done really well and one of my favorites. The diminutive king in this cartoon is based on a comic strip character of the same name who would love to do the things he saw his subjects doing, like for instance in this cartoon we see him selling pretzels like he saw the vendor doing. There isn't much talking in this cartoon, but in those days you hardly noticed anybody speaking. So anyway, check out Betty Boop and the Little King sometime soon! It's on DVD now so it'll be easier to find. I recommend it! It's very enjoyable!\n\n-"

Though they had used this method in other films primarily Popeye vs Bluto, the use of the very stylized train layouts and trains and cars is used in a wonderful manner. Play Safe is an amazing eye catching display of the artistry of diorama building, and the vivid color used in the display is dazzling. Worth the price to find and keep a copy! I have always wondered what ever happened to those train set layouts, the customized locomotives and cars, and if there had ever been any merchandising through the Lionel, Gilbert's American Flyer, or Marx Toys that came out of their very artistic efforts."

It seems that the Technicolor folks and Disney had signed an exclusive contract that had just expired and the Fleischer Brothers were quick to jump on the Three-Color bandwagon. This cartoon does look amazingly vibrant for its time because of the Technicolor as well as because it has been restored for the collection.\n\n\"Play Safe\" begins with an ultra-cutesy kid (the sort they loved to feature in the 1930s) playing with his train set. However, the kid is apparently mentally imbalanced and soon chases after a real train and nearly gets himself killed. When he's thrown from a speeding train and knocked out, he has a cool dream about trains--where he once again seems to have a death wish. Wow, I wonder if Freud ever got to see this film--what he could have told us about this character! However, instead of analyzing his phallic fixation or death instinct, the film is apparently a lesson on playing it safe--which the kid learns by the time the film ends when the family dog is forced to save his life.\n\nAs for the quality of the animation, it's really slick. They used a short sequence where they combined a toy train with animation--and it's nice. However, what really impressed me and which was a hallmark of the Fleischers was their 3-D look they perfected in the late 1930s. Very nice--and one of the cases where this studio actually was ahead of Disney. Worth seeing."

It's no wonder that little boys fell in love with trains (and, I suspect, a fair share of little girls, if we'd been honest with ourselves).\n\n\"Play Safe\" captures wonderfully the awe and delight a little boy would have for these marvelous, beautiful, giant machines. Who wouldn't want to climb up in one and play engineer? The 3-D process is ideal for showing the rows of locomotives as the boy wanders around the rail yard.\n\nAnd \"Play Safe\" does a great job of capturing the fear of a nightmare, as the boy is helpless to control the runaway train. In most cartoons from this era, the anthropomorphizing - where, say, a clock will grow a face and say something - seems quaint now, but for this cartoon, in the landscape of a nightmare, it fits right in.

                "text": "1936 proved to be a defining year in Mexican director Fernando De Fuentes' career, as it was the year when he released the two most important movies of his career: the musical comedy \"All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande\", and the war drama \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\". Two very different movies whose results defined the future of De Fuentes' work. The last one to be shot, but the first to be released, \"All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande\" became the most successful Mexican movie as the time, breaking box office records and receiving praise across the globe. On the other hand, the last par of his Revolution trilogy, \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\", suffered a troubled shooting and awful reception at box office. These results would make De Fuentes to decide to focus on commercially successful movies from now on, however, time has proved that while a commercial failure, \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\" was De Fuentes' true masterpiece about the Revolution.\n\nThe movie is the story of Tiburcio Maya (Antonio R. Frausto), Melit\u00f3n Botello (Manuel Tam\u00e9s), Miguel \u00c1ngel del Toro (Ram\u00f3n Vallarino), Mart\u00edn Espinosa (Rafael F. Mu\u00f1oz) and the Perea brothers (Ra\u00fal De Anda and Carlos L\u00f3pez), six very good friends who one day decide to participate in the Mexican Revolution by joining the forces under the command of General Pancho Villa (Domingo Soler), considered a hero by the group. Fighting alongside their hero, the gang begins to be noticed as a very skilled and brave team (earning the nickname of \"Lions of San Pablo\"), but while very exited at first, as the war goes on the gang begins to discover that war is not as glorious and fair as they thought it was, that courage and honor worth nothing in the battlefield, and that even history's greatest heroes can have very inhuman traits.\n\nBased on a novel by Rafael M. Mu\u00f1oz (who experienced Revolution first hand and also played a role in the film), the movie was written by Fernando De Fuentes himself with the collaboration of poet Xavier Villaurrutia. In a very straight forward fashion, the story follows the six friends and their misadventures fighting against the Federal government alongside one of the many Villa's squadrons. While De Fuentes' use of the six characters as one collective hero indeed does sacrifice some character development, he makes sure to establish a distinct personality for everyone to make up for that. Once again De Fuentes takes a critic position on the Revolution and instead of glorifying the war, he shows it as a corrupting hell where people is used like mere objects by those commanding the armies.\n\nFilm critic A.O. Scott once called De Fuentes \"the Mexican John Ford\", and this movie is quite probably the reason behind his statement. Finally working with a good budget, De Fuentes does an amazing job in recreating life during the Revolution complete with really good choreographed battles and an extensive care for historical accuracy. Visually, the film is a joy as De Fuentes' care for realism is wonderfully captured by the cinematography of the legendary Gabriel Figueroa (in of his first jobs) which together with De Fuentes' masterful domain of the montage techniques form a powerful and crude portrait of the war. In spite of the great technical merits of the movie, De Fuentes keeps the film focused on his characters and the crumbling of their ideals, effectively portraying the human side of the conflict.\n\nIn one of this earliest roles, legendary actor Domingo Soler plays the man himself, Pancho Villa, and as the general, Soler delivers a terrific performance that truly humanizes the figure of the general, avoiding myths and portraying him with all his virtues and flaws. While the \"Lions of San Pablo\" are our collective hero, some have more prominence than others. Antonio R. Fraustro makes an excellent job in his performance as Tiburcio Maya, the leader of the \"Lions\" and the one who idolizes Villa the most. Manuel Tam\u00e9s is simply perfect as the funny Melit\u00f3n Botello, showing not only his talent for comedy, but also a powerful dramatic presence. Ram\u00f3n Vallarino plays \"Becerrillo\", the youngest of the gang, and while struggles a bit, doesn't do a bad job. The rest of the cast has lesser screen time, but there are good performances by Carlos L\u00f3pez \"Chafl\u00e1n\" and a very young Ra\u00fal De Anda.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\" was completely overshadowed by De Fuentes' other movie, as the public preferred the uplifting musical comedy over the grim and dark meditation on the war. The harsh criticism De Fuentes makes about the revolutionaries and the figure of Pancho Villa (who is shown as a man far from the heroic ideal) didn't help in this matter, and the movie ended almost forgotten. However, \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\" is truly a monumental epic that shows the talent of De Fuentes as a director able to portray introspective human drama in an epic adventure, pretty much on the level of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah. Of course, when compared to his previous movie, \"El Compadre Mendoza\", the plot may seem simplistic, but De Fuentes never lets his story get boring or tiresome.\n\nWhile many critics consider \"El Compadre Mendoza\" as De Fuentes' best movie, personally I think that \"V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa\" is the movie where his style is at its best as everything just fits nicely with his vision of the Revolution. Sadly, the poor results of the film almost ended De Fuentes' career, so he spent his following years making commercially successful movies without caring too much for the art. Still, this movie is a fitting ending for his Revolution trilogy, and a fitting closure to the first era of Mexican sound films as this film inaugurated the \"Golden Age of Mexican Cinema\". 10/10"

                "text": "Vamonos con Pancho Villa is officially considered as the best movie ever made in Mexico. I personally do not agree to it but these are the facts from the Mexican Cinematography Industry Council. Revolutions, or any war for that manner are never nice happenings. Revolutions/wars imply the fact that many suffer to achieve an ultimate goal of a better life for all involved. In this movie that is exactly what goes on. A group of peasants, tired of the way they are treated by a few powerful owners of the wealth in Mexico, decide to get up in arms against them. There are 2 major leaders of this Revolution that started in 1910. Emiliano Zapata in the South, and Pancho Villa in the North. This movie tells the story, one of hundreds that have been told, about a group of peasants that join Villa's army. The crude scenes that are seen in the movie are just a pale reflection of what happened in those times. The movie, with all the technical limitations of the times(1935)is a magnificent work of art."

                "summary": "Unfortunately, the summary seems to give away most of the film!",
                "text": "Many folks consider this one of the very best Mexican films and I noticed that most of the reviews for the film loved it. The Mexican-based reviewers all gave it 10s or 9s on IMDb. The sole non-Mexican (before this review) was not in the least impressed by the film--giving it a 4! I think this is because the film has a very strong resonance for Mexicans--something that will likely be lost on other folks. Like the lone negative review, I don't have the emotional or cultural connection that made me love \"Let's Go With Pancho Villa\"-- and that may be why I was also so indifferent to the film. I didn't hate it but I obviously didn't see it in what the Mexican reviewers saw.\n\nThe film is about a group of six men from a small Mexican town who call themselves \"Los Leones de San Pablo\" (The Lions of St. Paul). They join up with Pancho Villa's revolutionary army and through the course of the film, they die off one by one. That is, until the end when there are two left and one of them has smallpox--and the other is ordered to kill him and burn his body!!\n\nAfter doing his duty, the sole survivor simply walks off into the night--presumably to return home to his family. HOWEVER, the DVD also contains an alternate ending--one that seems tacked on to make the viewers understand that Villa, after a while, became a real scum-bag and a man whose army lost their ideas. While the nihilistic alternate ending does a good job of making you hate Villa, it also seems overlong and a bit silly.\n\nSo why was I so indifferent to the film? The biggest reason were the battle scenes. Many (particularly earlier in the film) seemed almost like they were filmed in slow motion and there was no energy whatsoever about them. What SHOULD have been rousing scenes instead just seemed to drag on and on. So, technically speaking, this aspect of the film left a lot to be desired. I also thought the character 'Fatso' was a bit of a cheap stereotype. As for what I liked, when they weren't fighting, the acting was quite nice-- subdued but in a good way. Overall, a film that I was only mildly intrigued by at best and one that, to me, isn't even close to the best Mexico has to offer."

                "summary": "Some great epic scenes,  but in the end disappointing",
                "text": "The version of \"Let's Go with Pancho Villa\" shown recently on cable's Turner Classic Movies lacks the ending described by Sr. Maza in his plot description. Is there a longer version of the film available? (The TCM version ran right about the 92 minutes cited in the IMDb listing.)\n\nThis film contains a few impressive re-creations of battles from the Mexican Revolution, but the central story of six friends who join the revolutionary forces of Pancho Villa is rather episodic and eventually just peters out. Villa (Domingo Soler) appears in a few scenes, and he certainly is no comical caricature like the one created by Wallace Beery in \"Viva Villa!\" a couple of years earlier; but there is little sense of Villa's leadership or other qualities that made him such a major hero of the Revolution. The six principal characters are largely stereotypes -- the callow youth, the comic relief, the wise older man -- and only a few really emerge as individuals. As one might expect in a war film, some of the principal characters die, though some in unexpected ways. Only one survives, and he simply quits and goes home. \"Fin.\"\n\nThis film may have lacked the ending described in Sr. Maya because of budgetary reasons, but more likely because the filmmakers did not wish to offend Villa's numerous followers and admirers who were still living when the film was released (the general was assassinated in 1923, a few years after the Mexican Revolution ended). The conclusion really has a feeling of the filmmakers just grinding to a halt -- very disappointing.\n\nI can't recommend this film very highly except for those interested in historical films or Mexican film history. Despite ambitions for an epic, the makers of \"Let's God With Pancho Villa\" ended up with little more than a glorified buddy movie that just stops dead."
